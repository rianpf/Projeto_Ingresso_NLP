The fun will stop!GRAPHICS: The graphics are so clean and beautiful, no slow downs except for the first level, but this game pushes the limits on the PS2.SOUND/MUSIC: Even better than the graphics, the distant screams and gunshots, it sounds so real, you feel like your there.OVERALL: Now i will stick to my 4 star review because, the only thing to do is beat the game.

The graphics and other bells and whistles are great, the animation are very realistic and the weather effects really cool.  The running game is solid and the custome features deep and customizable.  What is the aforementioned flaw?  THE PASSING GAME IS INFURIATING.  If you play on any level above rookie (like most players), you will find passing to be quite difficult, with even the best receivers dropping passes or unable to get open.  &quot;But it's realistic&quot;  you say.  Well, if I wanted to throw 37% and an interception per game, I'd go play myself.  Video games are about allowing you to play like Joe Montana, not Joe Schmoe.  To add insult to injury, the computer will absolutely pick you appart at least 2-3 drives per game, where NOTHING you do will stop them from completing 5 passes in a row en route to a TD.  Even with a 99 rated secondary, the worst NFL teams will still carve you up for 250 yards plus.  The computer actually seems to &quot;cheat&quot;, whereby you will stuff their offense for 75% of the game, and then they will score at will to get back into the game, making incredible catches, having slow WR positively BURN 99 rated CB, etc.I recommend this game, but I have a feeling NFL 2K2 may surpass it!",3,"Solid, with one FATAL flaw...",999129600,"08 30, 2001"

Controls function now universally instead of having to hit the circle button to melee (I never did like that). The campaign isn't real long, but it's longer than the others considering now you have two characters to play with through each interval. You unlock Fettel after you complete an interval with Pointman. It's best if you just complete the story with Pointman first though and then go back and do all the intervals so you don't get mixed up and have trouble getting your ""Missing accomplished..?"" trophy. Speaking of melee earlier, you can jump kick, run and sweep, or knife depending on your movement. Fettel kills people with melee instantly if they are suspended and you hit R3 near them. I find the melee to be considerably more fun than the previous games allowing me to desire knifing or kicking all my enemies to their deaths. Gun play is smooth and I find it quite easy to head shot my enemies. Pointman has slow mo so he can hit his enemies dead on and with Fettel, he can suspend his enemies and head shot them with his psychic blasts. The best thing about Fettel is his ability to possess almost any character in the game allowing you to take control of their abilities and weapons. If you die in the possessed body, Fettel with simply drop it and continue fighting. If you get tired of the possessed body, you can commit suicide and blow your insides to out by pressing triangle. One downfall for this game is that no one plays online...at all. No one does matchmaking or even online co-op which is a drag because I've always wanted to play co-op online. I have played co-op offline however and it is still challenging if you do not work with your partner. Before you attempt co-op, I suggest you play through the story in single player first just to feel the scare alone.

4251,52562,A1UPNUCA5ATMPP,B0006TO2HM,David Keyworth,"[7, 15]","Is Apollo Justice a true Ace Attorney game? Yes.Is this worth buying for a fan of the series? Probably.Is it a strong new step to continue the series? Definitely not.The gameplay for this episode remains very much the same as the previous games. It's something you have to experience for yourself, but it basically involves a lot of dialogue explaining the murder, then you get the chance to try to prove a point with an intuitive Court Record system. It can feel pretty satisfying, and it's an idea I like to see continued in the series. There are some small minigames where you analyze footprints and fingerprints, but these have been largely to impress reviewers who believe that they matter at all. What matters in a game almost entirely based on text...is the story.I actually have to congratulate Capcom on deciding to change their star series' main character. Many developers, such as Hideo Kojima, might use their one-hit-wonder until he/she is balding and medicated. However, unfortunately many of Apollo's antics make you want for the original Phoenix. For one, he's young. He shows it in his actions, his relative height with the game's prosecutor, and the way everyone seems to treat him as a little boy. (Why hello, little Polly. Would you like a treat?)Many new characters are introduced for this game, including your assistant Trucy, a prosecutor named Klavier Gavin, and Apollo's mentor, Kristoph Gavin. Personally, I didn't quite like the dynamics of many of these characters; they all seem to be obsessed with one thing, unless it comes to helping you find the murder. Take note of that: The prosecutor HELPS you. And way too many people, to boot. The whole point of the game is that adrenaline rush when you prove a direct lie in the witness' testimony that proves him to be the murderer.You: ""Now explain that!""Witness: ""AAAGH! Y-you...you stupid attorney and your evidence!!!""Prosecutor: ""B-But...your honor, I object! This is...unjust badgering of the witness!""Judge: ""Wrong, Mr. Prosecutor. This seems quite condemning!""Assistant: ""Way to go! I hadn't even noticed that!""Here's how that might go down in Apollo Justice.Trucy: ""Hey, Apollo. What starts in 'Autops' and ends in '-y report'?""Apollo: ""Huh?...OH! You're right! OBJECTION! Witness, look at this! It, er...contradicts...""Klavier: ""I believe Herr Forehead means that it contradicts &lt;this>, ja?""Judge: ""Could the defense not yell 'objection' so loud?""Witness: ""Well, it seems like not everything went quite according to plan. Oh well.""Believe it or not, that last quote is more or less what one of the murderers says when found out. Basically, I felt like the game destroyed your sense of self-satisfaction from solving the case. Also, a few of the murders don't make any sense at all...During the last case, you do get a chance to play as Phoenix Wright for a short trial, but it just feels a little empty, especially because it ends in the loss of his badge forever.If you're still not too sure of buying it, there is a flash demo, and people have been uploading full YouTube videos of the cases (also available for the previous games!)",3,To all fans of Phoenix Wright: I'm very sorry.,1221350400,"09 14, 2008"

334,53025,AE5KSRWB9AHRY,B0007D4MW2,Timothy Read,"[5, 5]","Nintendo's WarioWare: Twisted! is yet another in the series of Wario Microgames. For those who aren't familiar with the concept, a Microgame is a five-second (give or take) game that has a single objective. There's no real manual, no instructions. You're just given one or two words and from those words, you have to figure out what to do. (""Slide!"" ""Stall!"" ""Only Devil!"", etc.) To that end, the game is very fun: you're thrown in with no real instructions and just your wits and reflexes to figure it out. No game is so hard that you can't figure it out without a few repetitions, however, mastery of some will take numerous times.WarioWare: Twisted! takes it to a new level by adding a gyro and rumble to the cartridge. Instead of manipulating a d-pad, you physically rotate the Game Boy. It's one of the most original and fun ways to control that I've ever encountered.Twisted also ups the ante over previous games by introducing new gameplay modes, most enjoyably, the ticking-clock mode. Basically, in this mode, you are given a set amount of time. If you complete your microgame early, you bank that extra time. If you don't complete it quickly, you'll draw against what you've banked. Run to zero and you're done. It's a fun change on the four lives mode that is otherwise the standard.And if you enjoyed unlockables, WarioWare has tons of them. In addition to hidden games and gameplay modes (e.g. Thrilling), there are tons of souvenirs, minigames, figurines, and other stuff you can unlock. And then you can still try to master each of the microgames on the cart.However, for all of its depth, Twisted does disappoint on some counts. One of the most fun things on the original game was seeing some of the crazy completion animations on a microgame (For instance, the surprised reaction of the now-bald guy in the original's haircut microgame). Since you're twisting and rotating, you don't get a chance to see these reactions as much.Secondly, while there are some genuinely fun games, there seems to be less raw originality. I found myself enjoying the games that were completely new or fun remixes of some of the WarioWare originals. However, a lot of the games felt like filler this time around. Additionally, despite the loose groupings of Jimmy, Kat, etc., each character felt like they had less of a theme this time than in previous entries.Finally, on some of the games where you have to use a ""shake"" motion, if you shake too much, you can jar the cartridge loose (this is on a GameBoy Advance SP model -- I can't say if the regular GBA cartridge slot is more snug).Overall, it's really enjoyable and a fun way to control the games. My only reservations are that the replay value isn't quite as high as previously and some of the fun touches are lost to the extreme rotation on some levels. These are only minor issues and only deduct the game one star -- it's still better than the vast majority of games you can play today.You may want to think twice or give this game a try before buying if you're prone to motion sickness in some games or if spinning makes you feel sick.",4,Original take on portable gaming; not the best in the series.,1119830400,"06 27, 2005"

5785,48493,A3RB0IJG7UOQCC,B0002AL28W,K. Butler,"[30, 41]","Having just completed this game the question on my mind is: What were they thinking?  Since it's early incarnation as an '80s 2d platformer Prince of Persia has been all about fluid animation, traps, and acrobatics.  Now we have ""Warrior Within""  a game that's not even supposed to be played by anyone under 17.  I'm an adult who enjoys a lot of ""M"" rated games. Prince of Persia should not be one of them.  ""Sands of Time"" had a unique, Disney-with-an-edge feel that ""Warrior Within"" completely sneers at.  Did the Halo guys call the Ubi Soft guys ""wusses"" at some game convention?  Who knows.  Something's got to explain the abandonment of nearly everything that made SoT a great game.And if you buy this game be prepared to spend a lot of time looking at loading screens.  But what about that rewind button?  There's been some industry talk of doing away with the YOU DIED/RELOAD screens and ""Sands of Time"" took a huge step in that direction with it's innovative rewind feature.  ""Warrior Within"" still has rewind but it completely negates the system in parts of the game by giving you no sand and forcing you to navigate long series of traps under a strict time constraint. Pause for a second and you're instantly murdered in a cut scene (no fighting back) and booted out to the YOU DIED screen for a reload that puts you at the beginning of the traps (no quicksave).  There are times I reloaded many times just to get a one-second, pre-murder look at where to move next. Guess how much fun that is! It goes far beyond just negating the rewind--there's more reloading here than in the last 3 games I played combined (at least the load time is quick).  It's amazing that Ubi Soft reversed direction and turned this sequel into a die-a-thon right up there with the worst Tomb Raider titles.By far the worst part is the level design.  By that I do NOT mean the rooms full of obstacles the prince must navigate--those are clever as ever.  I mean the overall pathways you must take to progress the game.  Or, more specificaly, the CONSTANT BACKTRACKING required.  You can tell the developers were trying to stretch the game by reusing maps.  But the frustrating part was that they didn't close off any of the wrong paths so you can burn an hour pursuing a dead end (enemies respawn, so no clues there).  If that's not bad enough, there are two time modes for all the areas, so you can backtrack in the past as well as the present (the time modes want to be as cool as the shifting phases in ""Legacy of Kain"" but just aren't). I was constantly unsure of the path I was on, even when on the correct one.  With so little feedback from the game even the fun parts were very worrying because I seldom knew if I was actually progressing.  The ""map"" they give you is a total joke.  Imagine navigating a tangle of streets with one of those kids jigsaw puzzles of color-coded states.The one silver lining is the combat system.  It's just beautiful.  Much better than SoT, which got old quickly. Fighting in ""Warrior Within"" is like controlling a 3D ninja straight out of a Pixar movie.  Even at the end of the game I was still pulling moves that surprised me.  There aren't too many games where I spend 15 minutes killing a room full of baddies and immediately reload for the pleasure of doing it all again.  That and the obstacle rooms kept me slogging through the frustrating parts. ""Warrior Within"" has many faults, but the work of the animators is beyond criticsm.

The whole game is unfair, you often face against dozens of enemies at once, with some of the enemies they don't have to wait a second to keep attacking, they can just beat you to death. A good example of this would be the Fellmuth Arena, you have 2 very strong boss like enemies attacking you at once, you have to do a certain attack to even get to the point where you can do any damage, that is if you can even do your attack. The whole game seemed unfair and no fun. I wouldn't buy this game unless it was like 5 bucks.

It's no surprise that the game involves a lot of violence, bloodshed and mayhem.The world you're in is run by a corporation, which is harsh and controlling. You are a male or female vigilante, and you have four maps on which you can work: a suburban mall, Chinatown, a suburb, and a corporate building.Each map is full-roam - you can go whereever you want in it. Each map is rather large too, complete with cars, glass windows to shatter, trashcans to pick up, and up to 250 running civilians, each with his or her own personality. While the graphics aren't glisteningly crisp like in Kingdom Hearts or FFX, they're still rather good. You can read the store signs in Chinatown and see the flower design on your character's Hawaiian shirt.There are different modes of game play, all single player only. You can just roam around in a map killing the bad security guards and gaining points from short-term goals such as ""blow up all enforcer cars"". You can do a timed mode where you have to work through a series of objectives, gaining time bonusses as you go to keep time on your clock. Finally you can take on the almost 200-mission main sequence, where you are given specific tasks to do in order and report back at the end of each one.On one hand, you can say that the game is very repetitive. While each level has different graphics, the tasks in each one are the same - avoid hurting civilians, kill the target enemy, gather up health. The splashes of red blood are continuous (although you can turn gore off).But on the other hand, it's an arcade game, not requiring much thought. It's mindless fun, giving quick results and easy progress. There are selections of weapons, from billy clubs to swords to flamethrowers and miniguns. After a hard day, there is great satisfaction in the smash of a plate glass window.Not for the young, with its constant attack mentality in city streets.

The graphics are great for a sandbox game with no hiccups in the frame rate, and the controls are responsive and easy to learn.I only have two problems with the game.  The first is that the decision you make that effect your karma are a little to black and white (think ""To harvest, or not to harvest"" in Bioshock).  It would've been nice to see some situations where the line was blurred a bit more.  The other problem is that, I'm about 6 hours into the game play, and there have only been about 3 different enemy types, with the exception of the Nemesis.  It would've been nice to have more variety in that.

It got boring and repetitive, coupled with the disappointment of it not being a &quot;real&quot; sequel to the original Super Mario RPG, which is one of my favorite games of all time. This game makes a marked improvement in the series. It starts off slow (get ready for much readings), and in the first 2 chapters I was thinking &quot;It's the same game as the last one!&quot;, what with the same 7 star collecting, the same first 2 allies, and so on. It wasn't until the Twilight chapter that I found out that there are more twists and originality to the game than I had first thought.The seven stars thing though. That's another one of the drawbacks to the game. This is Nintendo's 4th generation system, yet they are only capable of creating a game of equal length to the one on the 2nd generation system? Please. I'm sick of collecting seven stars all the time, can we maybe have more than seven worlds?To the positive points. The music isn't as bad as people make it out to be. Yes it's synthy, there are no choirs backed up by an orchestra here. The battling system is hugely improved, with the addition of stylish moves and interaction with a crowd, battles rarely get dull and redundant (for me, at least). Also, the graphics are great. For a game based off 2D characters, that's saying a lot. The animations are enjoyable which help the playability of the game a lot, I think.Since this is one of the very few RPGs, let alone exclusive RPGs, for the Gamecube, Gamecube owners can't go wrong with this game.

Because I was to busy playing this marvelous, classic game. RTS games (like command and conquer, starcraft, age of empires) either had good graphics or a easy good well written story, butnever both. Until now. War Craft 3 combines good detailed graphics and a really good story, thats easy to understand. They also add a new aspect of RTS. You can have heros. You can build up to three different heros for each race. Through the campain you lead a hero for each race. You can level these hreos up by battling with them. You get to play four epic campains beginning with the Humans, Undead, Orcs, and finally the night elfs. The story starts with some future seeing dude warning the humans of the end, but they can change that. As you expect, they ignore him even though hes right. You lead a paladin hero, Arthas, the campain as he tries to save Lordaeron by fighting the Undead. He chases a dreadlord (a undead hero) a tries to kill him. At the end of the campain there is a suprise, a big one. In the Undead campain you try to resserect some guy and try to bring the leader of the burning legion (a army of demons whos behind the undead). In the orc campain you try to find hellgromscream and do other things, and in the night elf campain, well... I cant tell you or it would ruin the story.

8423,57095,A30EXX7DBQX1FB,B0009S4UOA,Joseph,"[1, 1]","My love affair with Call of Duty began with the release of Call of Duty 2: Big Red One for the original Xbox.  The battles were intense, the scenery and graphics were top notch (at the time), the controls were smooth, intuitive, and easy.  Years later I played the original Call of Duty on my laptop.  I loved it.  Naturally, I wanted to play Call of Duty 2 on the Xbox 360 as a throwback.  It had the same feel as Call of Duty with updated graphics.  Personally, I prefer how the Russians were portrayed in Call of Duty: people oppressed by a Communist nation being literally forced at gunpoint to sacrfice themselves to the better equipped Germans to serve their natural end for the State.  In CoD 2, they seemed to shift gears and make the Russians perfectly willing and honored to die for the glory of their Communist oppressors (which I think was a departure from history in a way).  It's almost as if CoD 2 decided to present Russia as an honorable nation worthy of praise when it hadn't been but a decade or so prior to the battles you partake in that the Soviets deliberately starved their own people in a man-made famine, killing 5 million of their own citizens.  The ""drive"" of the Russians in the game, which seems one of honor, is a slight departure of what exactly they did to Europe after their successful fight against the Nazis (who were pretty closely related, philosophically).  All in all, I was empathetic to the Russians in CoD, as anyone with a heart or knowledge of history should be... but I was actually irritated with the Russian campaign in CoD 2.  Nevertheless, the fighting, missions, and chaotic action in CoD 2 remains strictly loyal to that of CoD and its expansions, which is a very good thing, believe me.That gripe has nothing to do with the gameplay, just a personal issue I had with historical presentation.  Though there were a handful of memorable moments in this game, there were not as many as there were in CoD and CoD 2: Big Red One for me.  I think that CoD 2 was a great sequel with better graphics and a nice change up in engagements (I really liked the Pointe du Hoc mission... very intense, even moreso after you ascend the cliff).CoD mastered the sound of warfare.  They carried that over to its sequel.  The explosions, gunfire, screaming from mortally wounded friends and foes, chaotic commands being shouted by soldiers in a state of panic.  It's all there.  CoD and CoD 2 cannot be knocked for sound.  It really sucks you in.Overall, the single player campaign is great, and I would recommend this throwback based on that alone.  Most of the missions provide intense battle moments with checkpoints that are spread out enough to make you think twice about running recklessly into the action.  It's a welcome return to classic CoD style where ""story"" is a history already written, no extensive dialogue and cutscenes with pretentious acting required.  You're given the time, the place, and the objectives, then you're thrown into battle as a private with a bunch of other privates (presumably one of the many 18 - 25 year-old greenhorns that volunteered for the war).  No one is a super warrior and at times you get that sense that you're just ""winging it"".  In the midst of this panicked chaos of war fought by inexperienced soldiers, you hardly will notice that you're kept on the rails by scripted levels.  The other thing I thought was nice is that there is enough size and freedom in the maps to allow you to flank the enemy or attack them head on.  Basically, it doesn't ""feel"" scripted, though it is.The multiplayer menus and functions are obviously outdated and obsolete.  If you're looking to buy this game in 2011 or beyond, do so only for the single-player; forget about multiplayer.  For single-player, it is a great game even more than for pure nostalgia.  I daresay I prefer this old-school CoD gaming style to the later ones that rely a bit too much on dramatic storylines to make the fighting interesting than just making interesting fighting scenarios.  The fighting is intense, chaotic, and a lot of fun.  I recommend buying a used copy for cheap.  It is definitely worth the $5 or $6 that you'll spend.  Don't overlook it because it's outdated.  The action and excitement it invokes will never become obsolete.

Saga to me, however, doesn't really even qualify as a game, considering you do roughly half as much watching as you do playing, which is extrememly ridiculous. Believe me, I have patience, but when it comes to watching dozens of 30-45 minute cutscenes, you can count me out.If Xenosaga is to get credit, it is for it's plotline. While it is interesting and thought provoking, it also doesn't bother to explain ANYTHING. Yes, this is Episode 1 of a 6 part series, but who cares; this is a game, it has a 50 dollar price tag, and I damn sure don't want to pay that much for a game that pretty much rips you off.On one hand, the cutscenes are well made, almost on the lines of MGS2. On the other hand, the first half of the game features mostly extrememly tedious and boring cutscenes. It is only in the next half of the game where things get interesting, but a lot of people will stop forcing themselves to play by then. Yes I said 'forcing', because the gameplay is utterly BORINGG.If theres one word that I would use to describe Saga's gameplay, its LINEARITY. Stick with me here: you watch a 45 minute cutscene, you run down a hall, take a few turns, fight some random battles, watch another cutscene, run down a hall, fight some battles, watch another cutscene, play through a long, tedious dungeon, watch another cutscene. You get the picture now? You see, the problem here is, the gameplay and story feel completely seperate. Its almost as if your watching an anime movie, except there are a few playable parts. The big problem is that the few playable parts are extrememly boring. Sure, the battle system isn't that bad by any means, but by the 20th battle, you'll be wondering why the hell your even playing.And that's what I asked myself while playing the game: why the hell am I forcing myself to go on? Just so I can watch another 45 minute cutscene? From what I remember, games are suppost to be 'played', and are suppost to be 'fun'. Xenosaga is not an RPG. You want a 'real' rpg? Play Morrowind or Neverwinter Nights on multiplayer. Don't get me wrong here, Saga isn't a failure, it's just that the gameplay feels like a poor excuse to keep watching more cut scenes. I sure as hell am never going to play this game again. I am a huge Xenogears fanatic, and I really hope that Episode 2 doesn't turn out like this one.

No.Will you be aggravated by a VERY linear game? Yes.Let me make this one thing known before I begin to rip into this game. If you are like me, who plays games to RELAX, then please avoid this game.I understand about a challenge, but I play a game to relax and to get away from everything for a little while. NOT to throw my controller, while playing the game AT THE LOWEST DIFFICULTY!Here are some of the issues with this game:Hit, or miss, Enemy AI - Sometimes they are as blind as Ray Charles, other times it's like they're superhuman. It's ridiculous.Hacking Inequality - One tiny question? Why are the Level 3 Hacking jobs tougher than the Level 4, or 5, Hacking jobs?Yeah, be prepared to get peeved at idiotic Level 3 terminal Hacking. But here's the kicker...They're EVERYWHERE (I would guess that roughly 70% of the Hacking will be Level 3 hacking).It should be that a Level 3 Hacking job should be somewhat difficult, but still easily doable. Not where a Level 3 Hack is harder than most Level 4 hacks!VERY Linear - If you've believed the hype, and think that there's ANY kind sandbox-like qualities in this game, sorry. The only thing ""sandbox"" about this game is whether, or not, you want to go through with the side missions.The Game Punishes Different Choices - The Coup De Grace of the aggravation in the game is the fact that it seems that the game actually PUNISHES you for choosing to go about things differently. Literally, you NEED a guide for this game, otherwise you will have a VERY tough time beating it any other way (did I mention how Linear this game is?).You HAVE to be set-up right, you HAVE to have the correct Augments, you HAVE to follow a set path. If you don't do any of this, be prepared to cuss, scream, die repeatedly, and throw you're controller around like a mad-man.You HAVE to sneak (well you COULD Run and Gun, but that will get you killed easily), it AWARDS pacifism (you get extra points for taking-out a guy without killing them), but it's set up where you'd have major difficulty doing that!Here's the problem, the game's AI is set up to make that damn-near impossible. You will have an insane amount of baddies in one tight area. This all but prevents you from sneaking around effectively.In MGS, you have more spread out areas, somewhat less enemies. In Splinter Cell, the enemy count isn't as pronounced. But, in this game, it's a small area, with a lot of enemies.To combat this, it seems that the game has become heavily reliant on air-duct sneaking...But here's the problem. How can you sneak around the damn air duct when the AI's superhuman abilities can all the sudden see/hear through air-duct vents?I don't know how many times I was busted (and died) by the AI, who was turned around, then all the sudden hears you, or somehow spots you (through the vents, no less) in the duct. And, by the way, this is on the EASIEST LEVEL of the game.Don't get me wrong, this game is very good. But it suffers from some the more annoying things that seriously hurts my enjoyment of the game.After all, I would rather forgo the challenge, and just have FUN with a game. The problem is, this game just isn't fun. I could play the heck out of the MGS games, even after I beat the game numerous times.But, I just don't see the need to replay this game IF I can get past the first play-thorough without breaking my controller!You can agree with me, or not, I really don't care. Everyone has different tastes, opinions, of what the deem fun. You might like really challenging games.

I loved Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skryim (three very different experiences, by the way). I don't really like MMO's, so please take that into account when reading my review. I thought I would like this MMO.I thought I would get at the very least Skyrim in a multiplayer experience. I was hoping for more of a Morrowind meets Skyrim experience. You get a lot of quests in this game, and they will help you level up. However, quite a few of them are boring and tedious, and lack the drama from the games. Some quests are designed to be played with a group of people, as I know of a couple where I ended up dying a lot. The items are ok, and you can get your gold up rather quickly just by selling items to merchants. You can craft as well, and I do like the bank options.This game also comes with a subscription price, so for me, I don't think the game warrants an additional $14.99 per month. If you don't pay after your free period, I believe your account is wiped (not saved).One of the things I loved about the Elderscrolls games mentioned above is that they are a game you can play for hours upon hours, and you don't even have to play the actual storyline. You can play at your own pace and you only pay 1 price. It was easy for me to get immersed into those worlds. I still play Morrowind and Oblivion! I didn't feel this with ESO. Instead, I felt like I had to rush to get my character leveled up, only to find out I really needed to find a group of players that would quest with me. I felt like I had to play, even when I didn't want to, to get my money's worth. Plus, once you're inside the game, you will need to block people all the time to get away from all the annoying &#34;ads&#34; people are shouting out. You have the Elder Scroll's &#34;lore&#34; and some of it's humor, but it doesn't feel like it when you are actually playing it.Personally, I think this game will end up like all the others: Free to Play with a bunch of added micro-transactions.I might be wrong, as there are quite a few people playing this right now.If you're a die hard MMO gamer who likes Fantasy, get this game.

So depending on how you feel about that tends most of your review, as a replacement for my existing one there was one area I was a little surprised with and not sure how I feel, the BluRay drive itself.It's a top opening device, so no more motorized feed.  The right side of the unit 'flicks' open to the left and the disc is spinning for a moment when you go to eject.  No longer can I push the button and point to a kid when I want it swapped out and my 12 year old bent a disc very uncomfortably not listening to me as I tried to explain how it's locked down.It's a bit noisier disk noise wise when the disks are spinning/reading than the older model, nothing you can't live with but after years of not hearing it suddenly hearing it is different.Came with charging cable for the Dual Shock 3 that was included.  Was easily able to install a 1TB HDD when finding the associated bracket on Amazon.com (see reviews for which one).

Sure, it changed video game basketball, but it also put the franchise a step back from realism, from the old days of Live 95, 98, and the best one I still think overall, Live 2000.In Live 06, we still see too many hyperactive glitches that should have (and could have) been fixed. The game engine, although still good, seems a bit tweaked out: in Live 04 it was the ""pro hop,"" in Live 05 it was the Freestyle Air, and now in Live 06 it is Freestyle Superstar. Although fun and interesting to play, I found it NBA Streetish. I was also disappointed in the lack of creativity EA has done. Compared to its competitor, they could have gone the extra mile and done more.Steve Kerr and Marv Albert do a good job in the booth, but why couldn't there be a female reporter on the sidelines every now and then? And what's up with the intros? Pretty lame. The current rosters loaded on the game are way out dated.

However, I still can't understand why EA has cut off the ability to import college players from March Madness. Their competitor does it with ease on their pro and college game!A positive aspect of Live 06 is the smoothness of the graphics and game play. It does not play like a basketball game should be played, but it is still fun.

7062,89161,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000TA52GI,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[5, 8]","Based on the anime and manga series by Tite Kubo, ""Bleach: Shattered Blade"" has all the parts in place for a good fighting game. However, the game defies all expectations in how poorly it is executed.The only thing relevant to the game that you need to know about Bleach is that there are ghost samurai called ""Soul Reapers"" who have unique swords with different powers. Sounds like a great basis for a fighting game, right? Well, ""Shattered Blade"" seems to somehow mess up the simple fighting game formula with a poor concept and poorer handling. The game is a ""3d"" fighting game - the two fighters can circle around each other to dodge attacks. Attacks are divided into three varieties - slash (horizontal slash), chop (vertical slash), and stab (forward attack). These are done by moving the Wii remote in the appropriate manner to imitate such an attack. The attack types work on a rock-paper-scissors hierarchy: chop beats slash, slash beats stab, and stab beats chop. So, basically, if you interrupt a chop attack with a stab attack, the stab attack will go through. There's also a little minigame that can occur if two swords clash where both fighters go through five rounds of ""rock paper scissors"" with each other. The more rounds you win, the more damage you'll do once it's over.There are three kinds of attacks. Regular attacks are done by simply waving the Wii remote with no buttons pressed - these are very fast but do little damage, and their purpose is to weather down an enemy for a critical attack. Critical attacks are stronger, slower melee attacks that are done by combining a Wii remote movement with holding down the A button. Critical attacks change depending on the character, but are not particularly personalized. Special Attacks are the final type of attack, and are done by holding B while moving the Wii remote. These tend to be more personalized based on the character - projectile attacks and special abilities fall within this category.Each character also has a powered-up mode, achieved by charging (shaking the Wii nunchuck) or by taking damage, both of which fill a gauge. Once the gauge is full, the character enters their higher-level state. This involves a cutscene that lasts about 5 to 7 seconds and cannot be skipped; in a 60-second battle, this is kind of an annoyance. Some characters simply get stronger with their powered-up state, while others change more drastically in their attack patterns. For example, Kenpachi Zaraki simply strengthens his attacks, while Toshiro Hitsugaya summons a giant ice creature to augment his techniques, and Renji Abarai turns his sword into a giant segmented snake that attacks his enemies.The variety of characters in the game is probably its strongest point, though this is due more to the series it was based on rather than the game itself. Each character has unique abilities; there are plenty of regular sword-swinging characters, but some also have unique twists like extending weapons, a bow (can only use ranged attacks), and one character whose blade heals his enemies, so he's forced to use his special attacks only (which don't use the sword) until he reaches his powered-up form, at which point he does massive amounts of damage (until it expires). The special attacks and powered-up forms are the primary things that separate the characters, though the fact that each character only has one or two special abilities at most in the series somewhat limits how unique they can be. There are 28 characters in the game (over half need to be unlocked by playing through story modes), each with their own fairly unique playing style.There are some extras included in the game, as well, though the selection is rather poor. You can buy character models and set them as the main menu guide (who just stands in the background and lists off the main menu choices as you select them), or you can buy new costumes for your characters. However, there aren't any real NEW costumes created for the game - rather, they're just costumes that were in the series for short periods of time, like the school uniforms that some of the characters wore when visiting the ""real world"".The problem with the game, control-wise, is just how poorly the whole ""rock paper scissors"" thing works. Regular attacks do next to no damage, so basically you're just trying to set up for a critical or special attack, which vary wildly depending on the characters. Characters with longer reaches, and particularly characters with extending weapons (Renji Abarai and Ikkaku Madarame) have huge, unbalanced advantages - they can swing their weapons with huge ranges with next-to-no penalty for doing so. The game is basically a button-masher in its purest form, except instead of mashing buttons you're waving a Wii remote hoping that whatever you're doing is the right type of attack to counter the enemy's. Just because of how random everything feels, the game is incredibly unfun and frustrating to play.The graphics in this game aren't great. It's obvious they tried to go for an anime style, with lots of japanese sound effects and speed lines, but overall the game looks like it belongs on a PS2 or Gamecube rather than a current generation console. Plus, with the speed of movement in-game, it's hard to even see the effects, anyways. One particular annoyance is that, in story mode, there are cutscenes at the beginning and end. However, these ""cutscenes"" are actually just a single still image with character voiceovers. The sound isn't great, either. The music is lackluster and forgettable, and the voice acting doesn't sync up particularly well. I have no problem with the English dub, but the way it's been put together with the visuals is pretty poor. It feels really awkward and clunky.It's difficult to convey how little fun Shattered Blade is to play. Even for a fan of the series, it's a complete exercise in frustration. The controls are so wonky (especially the movement controls, which allow you to go forwards and backwards or side to side, but not both at the same time, meaning you have to run in a zig-zag pattern and avoid the invisible walls around the arena) that the entire game is just completely unenjoyable.3/10.",2,Complete Exercise in Frustration,1224547200,"10 21, 2008"

This decision is to the game's detriment.The game that RFA most reminds me of is not Guerilla, but Dead Space 2.  There's a lone hero traveling through caverns and down dark corridors while blasting aliens and religious cultists.  I think that description gives too much credit to RFA though, since the story here is basically rubbish.  No explanation is given for why the cultists are doing what they're doing, and the story line involving the cult leader, Alan Hale, is dispensed with in a very unsatisfactory way.  Likewise, the origins of the aliens remain a mystery.So that leaves us the game play, which is for the most part good.  The destruction element is good and the game really shines when you get out of the dark caverns onto Mars's surface or into a vehicle where you can cause an amazing about of destruction.  The biggest flaw with the destruction element has to do with the structure of the game.  In Guerilla, the destruction was the point: the missions were all about destroying a convoy or blowing up a building.  In RFA, the game rarely forces you to destroy anything in order to succeed at the game - your primary goal is to enter a level, kill all the enemies, and maybe flip a switch.  The destruction is optional.There is fun to be had though, even if you have to go looking for it.  The game is worth a rental or wait for the price drop.

I was very impressed by the graphics and immersive environments the game creates.  Everything will be ugly after playing this.  Playing Black Ops reminded me of what it was like to go back to playing an original Xbox game after experiencing the Xbox 360 for the first time.  The graphics in other games now seem so... simple.  The Xbox 360 hardware has a hard time keeping up with this visual feast, and graphical detail draw-in is pronounced in the more complex levels (Dead City comes to mind).  The game's pretty face goes much farther than being just a pretty face.  Id has put an incredible amount of time and effort into this game and it shows.  Clever Easter Eggs abound, and the ambiance the game creates is second to none (although others argue it's derivative, which at times, it is).  So why the three-star rating?  Two critical design flaws that will make you want to throw your Xbox out the window.  The lack of auto-save and the inability to backtrack to closed off areas.  These seem like minor complaints until they screw you over, and believe me, they will.  First, the auto-save problem.  Initially I thought it was just a minor inconvenience to have to save the game every few minutes, but at around eight hours in I became complacent and managed to go through an entire level without saving.  At the very end of the level, as I was leaving, I became ""stuck"" in the ground.  My character then fell through the floor to his death, giving me the joy of re-playing the entire level.  The only safe way to play this game is to have the discipline of an auto-save feature.  Meaning after every battle, after clearing each area, you need to pause the game and physically save it.  It is beyond my comprehension why a FPS in 2011 was built with this feature omitted.  My second complaint will apply to the completionists out there.  There are things that you need to collect along the way that will bring the game to 100% complete.  These things are VERY easy to miss, even if you scour the landscape, and will become closed off to you with little or no warning.  I was foolish enough to start playing this game without this knowledge and spent several hours wasting time looking for the hidden cards in the game.  After dredging my way through every level and backtracking in an attempt to find missing items, I got sick of searching and referenced an on-line guide.  Low and behold, the card that I was missing was locked away in the Outrigger Outpost, an area that becomes closed off to you in the first hour or two of gameplay.  Since the achievements require everything to be completed in a single playthrough, my entire playthrough was a waste.  Around eleven hours...  I had to take a step back and think about this when it occurred to me.  In 2011, in an already over-saturated FPS marketplace, id puts out a game that (it seems) is designed to infuriate you.  I understand that id is the grandfather of first-person shooters.  I get it.  If it weren't for Doom back in 1993, maybe none of us would be here.  Much respect.  Maybe I deserved to be taught a lesson by their game.  But here's the problem.  I already have a laundry list of games that I'm trying to get through.  With plenty more coming out this holiday season, I've got my hands full.  It's not 1993 anymore, and id is not the only thing going on anymore.  So, instead of starting the whole miserable process of another playthrough, I asked myself, ""why bother?""  I decided it wasn't worth the effort.  If id can't evolve, why should it be my problem?  I've already suffered enough with this game.  That said, if you are planning to get the most out of this game, I would urge you to start from the beginning with the use of a strategy guide.  If you're just looking for a weekend distraction or a quick run-through, don't worry about the closed off areas and add another star to my review score.",3,WARNING:  Seriously flawed for completionists...,1318550400,"10 14, 2011"

3016,107804,A1UH8M9QALD2LS,B0019QEXZM,MS,"[8, 8]","STORY-As far as the plot goes, there's not much to say. The main character of the game is the dashing Mr. Esc, a professional escape artist who uses his talents to help trapped civilians in emergency situations. Each situation in the game has a different setting, and provides a small cutscene at the beginning to clue you in on what Mr. Esc's latest job is. The lack of a 'serious' plot doesn't dampen the spirit of the game at all, nor did it hinder my understanding of the game. For a casual puzzler like Exit, I feel as though this simple story worked just fine. In fact, I would say that it made Exit an even better game, especially for more casual players who want to pick something up and start playing right away.GAMEPLAY-[the basics]The gameplay is obviously the meat of Exit, since story and characterization are almost nonexistant.  Exit plays as a sidescroller in which the main idea is to get yourself and the survivors (called 'Companions') to the door marked 'exit' before the timer runs out. While the early levels may be fairly simple, they get more challenging and require more complex thinking as the game progresses.[controls]Exit has a neat little configuration system in which you can switch the controls from the stylus to the buttons if you so desire. I found this choice rather refreshing, since most DS games don't give you the option to mess with the controls. It takes a bit of getting used to (and a lot of stylus-tapping) to really get into Exit, but everything was cleared up after the tutorial stages. Tapping on a character and then tapping on their intended destination is usually enough to get from point A to point B. The camera is moved with the use of the d-pad. Most items are also used by either tapping or dragging the stylus, but it rarely gets more complicated than that. The simple control scheme makes this an excellent game for virtually anyone to play. Occasionally, it can get a little hectic  if there are too many characters in one area at a time, but other than that, I don't have many complaints about it.[stages]Each part of the game is divided up into situations, and in each situation there's a total of ten levels. While you start off with only 100 levels, 50 more can be acquired, making a total of 150 possible levels to play. This provides a more than adequate supply of puzzles for most people, and may take anywhere from 10-20 hours, depending on how often you play (and how much of a strategist you are). Each situation has a different theme. The second situation takes place in a burning hotel, while the fourth situation is located in a sinking cruise ship. This colorful variety of scenarios create unique obstacles and interesting challenges for you to solve. To make it short: you won't get bored with Exit anytime soon.[miscellaneous comments]An integral part of the gameplay is the use of Companions in order to advance through the stages. Mr. Esc is the most agile character in the game; he's able to hang from ledges, shimmy along pipes and drop up to five meters without dying. However, the survivors aren't quite as light-footed as Mr. Esc, which means that in many cases, they must be helped along to the exit. 'Adult' characters have many of the same abilities as Mr. Esc, but lack his ability to jump and fall great distances. 'Large adult' characters are slower, and have much more difficulty climbing and jumping than Mr. Esc, but they can also push large objects that are otherwise immovable. 'Child' characters are nearly incapable of jumping or climbing without assistance, but their small size makes it possible for them to crawl into spaces where others won't fit. 'Dog' characters can jump long distances and crawl into small spaces, but cannot use items or climb steep objects. 'Injured' characters can't move at all, and must be carried by someone else in order to reach the exit.Companions can't be commanded until Mr. Esc comes in direct contact with them. Until that happens, they will continue yelling ""I'M OVER HERE!"" and ""SOMEBODY HELP ME!"" at the top of their lungs. Sometimes, you can reach the survivors quickly, but usually, you can't get to them without a few minutes' time. To put it frankly, it's quite irritating to try and solve a complicated puzzle when you constantly have to listen to the nasally voice of a child asking ""IS ANYBODY THERE?"" every three seconds. I often found myself turning down the volume just to avoid hearing the whining of the Companions. Even once you come in contact with them, they refuse to shut up. Every time you select a Companion and tell them to do something, they respond with a loud ""GOTCHA!"" or ""NO PROBLEM!"". It may seem like nitpicking, but it was a flaw that was obvious enough to get my attention several times throughout the course of the game, and thus warrants mentioning.There are only two ways to lose a level in Exit. The first occurs if Mr. Esc or any Companion falls from a fatal height, or if they are otherwise injured by environmental hazards. The second possibility is to trap yourself or a Companion, rendering them unable to reach the exit. Many items can only be used once, and objects that have been pushed against walls can't be moved again. It's actually quite easy to screw up and have to restart the mission, even with careful planning. Despite the fact that I had to try many levels over and over to get the right solution, Exit never stopped being a fun game, and I enjoyed it immensely.VISUALS, CHARACTERS AND AUDIO-[visuals]The graphics of Exit are quite interesting. The backgrounds and objects are nothing to write home about, but the characters are probably what stand out most. Everyone in the game appears to be a sort of comic book-esque silhouette, portrayed in black and white with a few splashes of color. It's an interesting artistic choice, albeit maybe not one that everyone will like at first. What really impressed me about the characters were their smooth animations. Every type of Companion has their own animations that really bring the characters to life. I feel that Exit should really be commended for giving the characters so much personality without relying too heavily on shiny graphics to enhance the effect.[characters]There isn't really much worth noting about personalities for the characters in Exit (then again, it's hardly a necessary component of a puzzle game). One vaguely amusing feature is the ability to check the 'profiles' of all of the people you've rescued in the various missions. It was a nice little touch, and gave me a chuckle or two when reading about them.[audio]Exit's music was decent, and fit the theme of the stages well. However, there were no particularly memorable tracks that I enjoyed, and it usually just served as background noise: neither excellent nor terrible. Most of the time, I turned the sound down or off completely because of the aforementioned complaining from the companions.PROS/CONS-[pros]-easy for casual gamers to play - challenging enough for more 'hardcore' gamers-nice character animations and designs-uncomplicated story, which works well for this type of game-never too difficult or too easy to beat-simply fun to play!-lots of levels[cons]-companions make a lot of noise before you rescue them (trust me on this one)-music is nothing specialSUMMARY-Exit is a fun little puzzle game that does an excellent job of entertaining the players. The abundance of levels and the medium difficulty of most of the challenges make it a lengthier game than one might initially expect. It definitely requires quite a bit of strategy, and you may have to restart a lot, but I found myself enjoying every bit of it. I definitely recommend buying this game.",5,A Great Puzzler,1275955200,"06 8, 2010"

Gungrave is one of my favorite, which if you don't know has blood pouring out of every enemy as well as awards points for style.The game itself has ups and downs, sometimes in the same areas.The game is always moving from one thing to the next, so you never do the same thing for more than thirty seconds. Unfortunately this doesn't always leave you time to do the things you want to do, and you find yourself repeating the same thing every few minutes.The dialogue is pretty amusing. As for the plot, I enjoy the more serious nature of it. It's my understanding that people were promised that it wouldn't take itself to seriously or something.The critical hit system or whatever it's called is what the game is all about. It promises to make you be creative and inventive in finding new ways to kill enemies. Really it just tests how well you can follow orders in an entirely imprecise and impractical system. It is very hard, very unlikely, and very annoying to get most of them. Plus, it just requires nothing creative at all. It really is just follow instructions, however the system doesn't always read things properly. Frequently the enemies just end up dying in the same ways, same as every game.Between that, and the glitches are what hold the game back for me. You never lose more than 30 seconds of play time because it autosaves regularly, but it gets annoying. You get stuck a lot in relation to gameplay. Like sometimes your whip just gets stuck in the drop box, and then you have to reset. Or the dinosaur won't move anymore so you have to reset.I didn't love the weapons either. Really the biggest disappointment for me was that there was not that much gore.The game is a really great time waster, and fun despite the issues, but it could be better. I'd wait until it is only 20-25 dollars, or rent it! Would make a great rental for something to do on the weekend.On a last note, I don't care about multiplayer and didn't try it.",3,The Game Has ADD,1301184000,"03 27, 2011"

There was a time (early 1990s), however, when this was not the case, and it took one game to begin the revolution...Wolfenstein 3D.Set in a prisoner-of-war camp in the heart of Nazi Germany, early 1990s gamers were introduced to the FPS genre in the form of one B.J. Blazkowicz and this single sentence: ""You crouch over the guard's body, hoping that the others didn't hear his muffled scream..."".  From there, gamers were given almost total control of the character in order to complete each stage (primarily accomplished by finding the elevator door after taking out room after room of Nazi baddies).In hindsight, the game had a few flaws, primarily being the maze-like environment that turns some levels into nothing more than prolonged searches for keys to enter the locked doors, as well as some levels that will test even the most patient of gamers with their enormity.  But all told, it was nothing short of revolutionary in its treatment of the video game platform.  It even ""guessed right"" in using a wartime scenario to detract from some criticism (the same reason why COD is so popular, yet other FPS's are so demonized).Thus, this game (provided you have a computer old enough to run it, or know how to install DOSBox!) really can be enjoyed by two different types of gamers: 1. For nostalgic purposes; and 2. For those who currently enjoy the genre to see how it all began (and still play a heckuva game in the process!).",4,In The Beginning...,1272326400,"04 27, 2010"

This game feels like a AAA blockbuster shooter and there are still moments when I can't believe I'm playing this kind of game on a handheld. The second thing I noticed was that the game was actually really fun to play. As someone who's played console first person shooters for nearly a decade, I found little to complain about when it came to the controls and feel of the gameplay. Obviously, this game wouldn't be possible on any other handheld device because it takes full advantage of the Vita's excellent dual analog sticks. Aiming feels precise and direct after minimal acclimation. The game also brilliantly employs the touch screen to make things like switching to grenades even faster. Of course, physical controls (down on the pad in the case of grenades) are still there if you prefer.Overwhelmingly, the campaign was a positive experience. Good level design (and those beautiful visuals!) complements surprisingly good AI enemies and a decent story. Each level also has distinct challenges that can be completed with additional run-throughs, which successfully adds great replayability. The multiplayer is also incredible considering it's on a handheld system. It runs surprisingly smoothly on most internet connections and includes a full ranking system with achievements, challenges, collectibles, buyable weapons and all kinds of stuff. It's a truly fleshed out multiplayer shooting experience right on the Vita. Just amazing!If you like shooters, have a Vita, and were thinking about getting this game, stop thinking and just get it. You will not be disappointed. If you were holding off on getting a Vita because it didn't have a great shooter then this is what you've been waiting for. Get a Vita now, and get this game.

Sure, their games were bottom of the barrel when it comes to every important aspect of gaming, but they knew how to take advantage of the technical flaws of the NES and produce unlicensed games for the console. What did they get out of it? A bunch of laughs from retro video gamers like myself, especially with their most notorious title under the Wisdom Tree moniker, ""Bible Adventures"".This is one of those games that you would either punish your children with or be one of the very few titles that Ned Flanders would ever let Rod and Todd play. It consists of three games, but let's take a look at their objectives:""Noah's Ark"" - Wander around as Noah and pick up two of every creature to carry back to the ark.""Baby Moses"" - Pick up baby Moses and carry him to the end.""David and Goliath"" - Pick up sheep and carry them to the goal.Sounds like loads of fun, especially when all three games have the same concept that was heavily lifted from Super Mario Bros 2 (or if you're wanting to be super critical, the Japan exclusive disk game ""Yume K&#333;j&#333;: Doki Doki Panic"", which Super Mario Bros 2 is based off of). By the time you finish the first level of any of these stages, it's hard to feel satisfied, instead repulsed at the fact that time was wasted to carry things to their goal and nothing else. Sure, there may be a few enemies to raise the challenge, but who cares when the gameplay is no fun whatsoever? Let's not forget to mention that in order to get health points, you have to look at Bible verses that pop up. I can't make this stuff up.With awful gameplay aside, the game itself is poorly programmed. The music is recycled, the graphics are below average, and it's very comical to see your character pick up multiple objects at one time. You can tell how hard they worked when it came to the debugging process from playing even a minute of it.Trash like this is a mockery to the NES catalog.

3446,135922,A7HDIBPWU66SR,B002I0F5M8,new Tron,"[1, 1]","Video game sequels that learn from their previous mistakes, and build upon existing foundations, have been a staple of the game industry over the last 5 years, and no other sequel exemplifies this more than Batman: Arkham City.I enjoyed the previous game in the series, Arkham Asylum (see my review).  It had some flaws that kept it from being great, and it demonstrated the hallmarks of a relatively young developer finding its footing, but it was a very good game regardless that showed lots of potential.  The new game, Arkham City, is the full manifestation of that potential.  It is a masterpiece through and through.  It retains all the excellent qualities of Arkham Asylum: the excellent graphics and soundtrack, the top notch voice acting, and one of the finest combat systems to ever grace a video game.The key difference between these two games is implied in the titles of the games.  While Arkham Asylum was a more closed-in, claustrophobic setting, the prison of Arkham City is vast, vertical, grimy, and glorious.  The huge, open gameworld is a natural fit for Batman and his arsenal of gadgets.  Stalking your enemies from the tops of high rises, grappling from rooftop to rooftop, finding secrets around every corner...the game manifests the concept of being Batman much more effectively than its predecessor.  Batman is a detective, and Batman is a hunter, and the environment seems to be designed around allowing these two concepts to fully blossom.  Also, given the multifaceted gameworld, there is also so much more to do here.  You can deviate from the story at any time to take on a plethora of side missions, which are not only fully-encompassed stories in themselves, but also introduce key characters from the Batman universe into the story.  This is a fuller, richer game than its predecessor, and offers an experience unlike any other video game out there right now.One other aspect of Batman: Arkham City worth mentioning is the story.  While the story is very good throughout, it takes an incredibly emotional, powerful turn in the last quarter of the game that will leave you stunned.  Narrative was a key focus of the previous game in the series, but just like in every other area, Arkham City's story absolutely soars.  It's an unforgettable Batman story that will proudly stand alongside the the best Batman comics and movies.If you played and enjoyed Arkham Asylum to any degree, buying this game is a no-brainer.  But for anyone else out there who is unfamiliar with this series of games and is pondering picking this game up, I highly encourage you to do so, as I truly believe that there is very little here that can possibly disappoint.  It is one of the most expertly and lovingly crafted video games I have ever played, and this fully manifests itself in the incredibly enjoyable, exciting, and unforgettable experience that is playing Batman: Arkham City.  This is one of this generation's top games.  Get it.ADDITIONAL NOTE:  Purchasing the game new will also give you access to several missions where you can play as Catwoman, who moves and fights very distinctly from Batman, and is SO much fun to play as.  Not only this, but her story arc intersects with Batman's several times in the game, and playing as her makes the entire experience much richer.

I saw this sequel and got it instead.And was terribly disappointed.The basis of the game is arcade-like and quite fun.  Customers tell you what they want and you have to recreate your cake confections before they get irritated with waiting and walk off.  You can keep them entertained with a tv or a cookie to help the waiting.  Their orders range from simple cakes to ones that have double layers, different shapes and cake toppers.  Some have said the game is too slow, but you have the option of buying shoes that will speed up your baker.  These can be upgraded more than once until you are almost TOO fast.The sound effects are simple and quite annoying.  The wacky kids with the inflatable pool duck toys are the worst with their canned ""Hey its my turn!""  Everything else is pretty much easy to ignore, but add little to the game itself.HOWEVER, Cake Mania 2 has one really crippling problem.  This was originally a PC game and the real estate of the DS screen is nothing compared to what you can get out of a computer monitor.  Instead of doing a back/forth switch screen like Diner Dash does to get over this hurdle, the game tries to shove everything on one screen.  AND FAILS.  TERRIBLY.  Everything requires absolute precision and the touchscreen seems to be a little off as well.  The places to trigger the correct cake shape and frosting colors are tiny so you have to stab the stylus like it was a needle in the exact spot.  Also, the customers request their orders in a ""picture bubble"" and when it gets to double layer cakes with toppings its often hard to tell exactly what they are asking for.  The sprites are so tiny that a round cake with red frosting can look like a heart shape cake with red frosting and vice versa.  Especially when there's a bear or cat topping on the top of it all to obscure even more of the cake you are supposed to be baking up.Overall, the game is quite alot of fun, although extremely easy.  The only thing that makes it difficult is the touchscreen issues.  The developers must have been aware of this hurdle because it seems to be reflected in the game's difficulty.Ah and its not that much different from Cake Mania 1 either, which is a superior product in many ways.  It's a shame that this second effort couldn't keep up the fun of the first, it just simply doesn't add enough to spice things up and the frustrating controls suck alot of enjoyment out of it.",2,Technical Issues Make Baking a Real Drag...,1223769600,"10 12, 2008"

Your 200 hours of Disgaea or your total domination of FFT will not help you here.  The mechanic is drastically different, and it requires a new kind of strategy to conquer.Here's where I had the most fun; learning the new wrinkles in the gameplay system, using the environment and positioning to my advantage and actually playing a game where a character mobility is as important as their relative strength.  RoS is an odd bird in the RPG world, but the innovation is worth the frustration.Now even with all the challenging fun, this game is nowhere near perfect.  The documentation is terrible, along with the in-game tutorial.  The larger metagame is never really explored (errands) and mistakes can be made without any chance to go back and fix them.  For this part of the game gamefaqs.com is your friend.  Along with lack luster unit/environmental art, uninteresting/sometimes repetitive music, and other strange design choices this game loses a star from me.All that being said, for fans of SRPGS Rondo is a real gem.

Here is an attempt at objectivity.Carnival Games contains 20 mini-games that range from fun to mildly amusing to downright uninspired.There are a couple of tossing game modes that feel natural - the ring toss and alley ball.  But other's have a floating crosshair, and the accuracy of the throw is only determined with timing.  These modes are shockingly bad.  The rollercoaster game is equally uninspired.

I personally enjoy the Crash-Test dummy - it is a clever little game, and some rave about the Monkey-See-Monkey-Do mini game.  I can see the attraction there.  The question is:  are two fun mini-games worth $50?  This would be a fine title for the bargain bin.  I would set the fun to dollar ratio at $15.I would recommend this game for casual gamers that would like a low-key game to demonstrate the Kinect's abilities to those that can not jump or athletically thrash about.  Most of the game modes require a minimum of movements, and lack any kind of difficulty setting.  This means that once a game is mastered, there is little reason to play it again.

In GT5 I'm very disappointed in the fact that when I press the gas pedal coming out of the corner a 516 HP car doesn't react until I've cleared the corner completely.  It just isn't realistic which puts this wheel in the same class as the ones from the 90's to me.I know the developers and engineers can make the hardware/software realistic.

2572,98286,A4VF4V6A4W0H7,B000ZKA0J6,Gargus,"[11, 22]","This is coming from a long time fan of the series. I purchased this game the day it came out, I beat the single player campaign and have spent at least a dozen hours playing online.After being a big Star craft fan for so long I was psyched about this when it came out. I bought the original Star craft (with the zerg box) on the day it came out and I beat it 3 or 4 times, played the online for awhile and got many years of enjoyment out of it. So when Starcraft 2 came out it was a no brainer that I wanted it. Well much to my dismay part 2 is by far the inferior of the two games in just about every way possible. So Ill just give reasons why below I did not like Starcraft 2.1) You do not ever get to explore the maps, create your own strategy or play how you want in the single player campaigns. Every single player map basically tells you what to do exactly and almost how to do it, the game holds your hand the entire time and guides you everywhere and giving you a cue every time something needs to be done. The entire game is literally a giant tutorial and nothing else. I never felt like I had a chance to explore, to set up defenses, to try and use strategy or anything on my own. Like for instance when you earn the ability to get siege tanks its because you ""find"" them on a mission, I use find loosely as its unavoidable to find them and then the rest of the map is setup specifically designed to let you use the siege tanks to win and doing so otherwise just doesn't work. Or one where again you ""find"" a vehicle and have to stop these trains, well unless you use the vehicles you ""found"" against the train you won't win. Every map is staged so you have exactly what you need and every map has a specific pre-designed way of beating it. They are all exactly as small as possible so you don't wander off and do something dumb like play your way. Every single player map is like playing a game of chess where the pieces are setup for you already and the only way to win is to do things the way a diagram laid out for you says.2) Blizzards amazing story cut scenes are designed horribly. You'd think this was gears of war in space because all the men are these giant bulked out muscled guys that have to weigh 400lbs of pure muscle with arms so big that they are bigger than my torso. I thought we would get away from the chris redfield of resident evil 5 and gears of war school of character design. This is a little gripe yes but it kind of ruins my ability to suspend disbelief when every male in the game (aside from the skinny nerdy guy) look like they are smuggling car fenders on their clothes.3) I still dislike that I paid 60 bucks for 1/3 of a game. I know blizzard said many times that they couldn't put all of the campaigns in here due to time and so on. But I look back at Starcraft and warcraft 3 where they managed to fir great multiplayer, many single player missions for all 3 races and a complete storyline onto a single 700mb cd but they can't do it with a dvd or two now also? I don't like the idea of paying 180 dollars to play all 3 races. Now since they merged with activision this tactic or more money is becoming more evident, I don't think it has anything to do with time or whatnot. Since merging with activision their prices have gone up, starcraft 2 cost 60 when they used to cost 50 like all of pc games, the starcraft 2 collector's edition now costs 100 when it used to be blizzard only charged 60 for the collector editions, the WOW:CATA collector's edition also got its price raised by like 30 bucks. The game was chopped up into 3 parts so they could sell more and nothing else.4) Every other mission I felt like I was being rushed as much as possible in the single player campaign. It seems like every other mission has a timer of some sort. Save the colonists before the protoss kill them, destroy the trains before 5 get away, get out before the never ending wave of zerg kill you and so on. Way to often the game is rushing you through the map.5) Even if you don't play online, you still have to connect to your online account to play. You have to get a battle.net account, you have to register your games cdkey and you have to be connected to your battle.net account before you can play a offline single player game. I don't like having to login so I can play a game offline.6) There is no LAN support in the game meaning if I want to play with friends we are forced to go online and get funneled through the battle.net service. I don't like that, I liked being able to get on a LAN with my friends right there and play 100% lag free with no problems. But blizzard removed that feature purely so were forced to us their battle.net service in order to keep us on their servers. So the people I play with we tried it a couple times and didn't like it, so we fired up the original Starcraft instead and played on the lan and had more fun actually.7) The multiplayer still sucks because of how the game is designed. Unless you practice and follow the exact same build order as found on online faq's like everyone else you'll get crushed online. The game is inherently flawed for online play to give victory to people who build stuff in a certain way. Play against a terran and watch them and they will all build the same things in the places in the same order. If you enjoy playing others but don't like following the exact same pattern every time you play and play to rush through as fast as possible then you won't have much success online or much fun either.All in all blizzard has made Starcraft 2 vastly inferior to Starcraft 1 in every way possible. Aside from the fact the graphics are nice in part 2 there isn't a thing I liked as much as or better. I can't recommend this game unless it costs 15 bucks or less to you.",1,Just buy the original Starcraft instead.,1303171200,"04 19, 2011"

However, for the price tag, you would think there was a epic campaign tacked on, So I guess I don't understanding the price point.Now on to multiplayer, it's fun at first, for one or two hours.

While I must admit, it was definitely fun to see these games again, they were somewhat of a disappointment. Not that I've been spoiled by PS2's recent high tech games of 2003-04, but because the game play from this Anthology was just bad. First, on ""Tempest"" as well as ""Asteroids"", there's a huge blue inanimate bordor around the screen. Thus, it makes my 36 inch TV screen look like a 27 inch. Second, when I pressed the buttons on my PS2 controller, the games just didn't move very well for me (while playing ""Tempest"", the little thing you have to move around in a circle/shape is very hard to do utilizing all 4 PS2 buttons on the controller). Other games featured this useless bordor as well, and others (mostly) from the Atari '2600' system did not. The picture itself seems dull. I remember ""Asteroids"" being so basically simple - yet the little triangular white ship and the white boulders flying across the screen were so sharp against the black background. My 20/20 eyes don't see these shapes very sharp (almost blurry) at all on this game. The sound is also lacking... like it's totally MONO sound quality. The cover of this game boasts 85 game titles (18 of which were actually found in the arcades)... but after you play a majority of them once, I guarantee you'll probably never look at them again. Definitely a fond throw back to see games I grew up on; like ""Missile Command"", ""Battlezone"", ""Red Baron"", ""Centipede"", and even the grandaddy of them all, ""Pong"". However, as stated before, the game play is difficult on most, the picture quality is average at best, and the sound is poor... overall a poor representation for PS2. Looking for a halfway decent attempt to bring back some of the old classic games - check out ""Museum"" by Nameco (featuring ""Galaga"" and ""Dig Dug"" - both look and sound great).",2,Atari does NOT make a good transfer to PS2 here,1106697600,"01 26, 2005"

The Half-Life 2 trilogy is great as expected and there are countless of reviews on it so I won't bother. Same thing with Portal, which is actually my favorite game in this bundle, but i gave it 3 stars overall because of the HIDEOUS design of the ""EA classics"". It is the worst design that I've seen. I simply do not get the concept of such designs but to make it worst there are absolutely no updated images and I had no idea that EA did this with PC game boxes. So if you are like me and like the original box designs, either buy it used or on ebay and make sure that it is an orange box and not a puke yellow one.DRM - the DRM used in this games is Steam, if for some reason you still didn't know. Steam is an always online game client which also works as DRM, but now days people are more used to it. It is possible to make it go offline but it is said to cause problems (http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Steam#Steam_Offline_Mode).For those of you with a slow internet connection might find it annoying but at least the games are installed from the DVDs and then are updated. The only real problem is Team Fortress 2 which is more than a 6 GB update and after that Steam will update it at least once a week from roughly a 50 MB to probably a 500 or more MB to make it compatible with all types of mods that people make in the steam workshop. The big problem is that the updates are not optional for any game, either they get the update or you can't play it.There is also Team Fortress 2 Beta which is the same thing as the regular one except with a limited amount of players and non-responsive bots. So it is best if you skip this game unless you want some practice and/or have some complete unnecessary achievements.The bundle also includes Half-Life 2: Lost Coast and its about 3 GB but its worth it. Its pretty much what you would expect from a Half-Life 2 game.

9540,71041,A3MZZGA8Q2W6DC,B000FUG5TA,"C. Forman ""open-minded skeptic""","[0, 0]","(MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW.)Touch Detective is a point-and-click adventure game, much like Trace Memory, or Phoenix Wright without the courtroom scenes.  You go around talking to people and looking at objects to find clues.  Sometimes you'll interact with items to solve problems, all using the stylus.  The interface couldn't be easier.  You tap a spot on the screen to have Mackenzie go there, or examine an object.  There's an inventory bar for using things you find, and a close-up screen where you can inspect them in more detail, or combine them with other items.  But whereas everything in Trace and Phoenix made sense to me, Touch Detective is just plain bizarre.The strangeness starts with the characters.  Mackenzie is the protagonist, taking over some sort of detective service (never really explained) left to her by her parents.  She lives with a butler/inventor, and a little mushroom guy (never explained either) who follows her around and occasionally helps her.  Her friend Penelope is always fretting about some problem Mackenzie must help her solve.  Then there's Chloe, who thinks she can be a better detective than Mackenzie and is always trying to crack the ""case"" first.  Some of the supporting characters are talking animals: Penelope's landlord is a giant talking bird, and there's a walrus who works at the skating rink and a shark who hangs out at the local bakery.  After awhile you just sort of go with it.The cases are equally off-the-wall.  In the game's first case, Penelope is convinced that someone is stealing her dreams while she sleeps.  So Mackenzie has to sniff some mushrooms (hence the ESRB's E10+ ""drug use"" rating) to let her enter the dream world and investigate.  In another, Penelope asks her to rescue a ""snow fairy"" trapped in a skating rink that's about to be demolished.  Some characters or story developments don't appear until Mackenzie does something elsewhere, but the connections between events aren't always clear, so there's a lot of wandering around to see if anything's changed as a result of your actions.  Puzzle solutions range from ""Okay, that kinda makes sense"" to ""What the HELL??""  Since there's not a lot of logic involved, more than once I resorted to the old brute-force method of ""click everything on everything else until something happens"".  Maybe everything makes sense if you're a preteen girl, or Japanese, or both.  Personally, I found myself cracking up at the sheer weirdness of it all.I don't think all of this is due to poor translation from the original Japanese text, I really think Atlus did the best they could.  But since you can convey a lot more information with katakana than English, the localization people didn't have a lot of text space to work with.  I get the impression they really had to condense it to make it fit at all.The main game is pretty short, with only 4 cases to solve.  Even never fully understanding what was going on, I managed to stumble through it in a few hours.  Thankfully there is some replay value in the form of some bonus tasks at the end.  There's also a scavenger hunt in which Mackenzie finds different objects to touch, and ""rates"" them according to how they make her feel.  (I TOLD you this game was weird!)In the end Touch Detective isn't a particularly great game, but the odd stories and conversations are endearing, and it was entertaining, so I decided to give it 4 stars instead of 3.  I'd recommend it to fans of point-and-click adventures, so long as they come knowing what to expect.

Why not make us press a button to breath?Some mechanical doors won't open unless you flip a switch across the room? There was no electricity required to open the door!! This made simple tasks such as going short distances overcomplicated. You may clear a room and when you get to the door, it won't open even though your character reaches for the handle. It doesn't tell you what to do so you re stuck wandering around a room trying to find an alt exit or a switch that has nothing to do with the door.Some doors push you out of the way when you open them which slows you down from getting out of the cold. Some pass right through you which just makes it even more frustrating.You will shoot an enemy multiple times and it won't be effected. It will still walk right up to you and kill you.

Well its sequel is even more linear, much faster-paced, more action-packed, and the stealth missions are gone. These may be good things for most game-players, but I for one miss the more laid-back gameplay of the original.Some missions give you a choice as to which brother you want to play, which will affect your playing style and weapons. The mechanics of the weapons are similar the first game, however this time, if you want to use the lasso, you've got to twirl your mouse, which works just fine. There are automatic save-points, but the quick-save and quick-load and normal manual saves are present as well.Yeah, it's not the same game game as the original. In some respects it's better, and in some ways worse. Visually it's awesome. As in the last game, you really feel like you're right there in the wild southwest (aside from the first two Civil War missions, which made me feel like I was playing another History Channel Civil War game). Voicework is once again excellent, and the guy who played Reverend Ray in the original game is back and doing another fine job. Music also excellent, fitting the mood perfectly. In fact, the overall atmosphere is so exactly perfect, it's almost uncanny.There are secrets and loot to find in every mission, however if you ""complete"" your objective before you find it all, your brother will go wandering onward without you, and you will instantly die if he gets too far away. There is a bit of leeway, but in my mind, this was totally unnecessary and needlessly aggravating.As an ""experience"", Bound In Blood is utterly captivating and very exciting.But as a ""game"", I have to dock it a little because of it's relentless linearity, and ""insta-fail"" possibilities.It's a very, very fun game, but it could have been legendary if they'd just done 3 things: Put the stealth missions back in (except without the insta-fail mechanic the last game used), make the player less tied to the brother, and allow some freedom for exploration.

Turns our you really get what you pay for. It was my first (and last) game download purchase from Amazon. They had a chance to pull me away from Steam and failed. Your experience may vary as one can see from reading all the reviews on this game (for some people it works flawlessly, others encounter issues too numerous to list). I hope Amazon will not edit my review and at least 1 or 2 poor souls looking to get the game they paid good money for to work can make use of my experience described below.The game file is big and aware of that, I downloaded it from work. Download speed there is faster and instead of taking days (meaning pauses to download etc...) I could get it done in a couple of hours while leaving the PC (docked and wired connection) behind for meetings. So I did try to take precautions given the numerous reviews mentioning file corruption.Back at home I try to install the game and it fails with the least informative error message ever ""DA:O failed to install"" and some generic ""Why don't you try again?"" kind of suggestion for a fix. So I make sure I go to task manager and kill every possible task I can and try again, this time keeping an eye on the boring install window to try to catch the issue. At around 70% of the install it hangs up and I was quick enough to capture a screenshot. So I found my corrupt file. In my case it was ""addins\dao_prc_ep_1\core\env\vgk200d\vgk200d_1216.gpu.rim"", yours may be different. Shortly after the hang up the failed install message showed again.Wondering if anything went wrong with the download I decide to try again. Deleted all files from the PC and downloaded even a fresh Amazon installer, 2 days later I have a new file to try again. Did not work. The install failed again and *on the exact same file*. This is important because I would think a file corruption from the download process would be random. The fact it failed at the exact same file makes me wonder if Amazon is not just selling a corrupted game.I then proceeded to try fix it myself, since I read enough about the lack of helpfulness from EA and Bioware in technical issues from both Amazon and other forums. And I wanted to avoid getting on EA's bad side since there are instances where even bans from forums locked people out of their games.Forums did not help much. A lot of people mentioned ""fixing the corrupted files with good ones"" and I kept wondering ""Where did they get these so called good files""? Others suggested using Origin. I refuse to install it on my PC on principle (you could say I'm a Steam fanboi) so not an option (I must point out I would have broken down and installed it if I had not been able to fix it any other way).How I actually fixed my issue: using Google and WinRAR (which has just converted a free trial into a purchase). I googled the file name of my corrupted file. Needless to say, the results are less than savory sites. I was not worried about breaking any law since I legitimately purchased the game, but virus/spyware are always an issue. Given I have firewall, anti-spyware and anti-virus installed I took the jump. And in the process I found out that I did not only have a corrupt file. There were at least 3 dozen files missing from my install folder (the unsavory site I used placed the files neatly into the correct paths so it was easy to see things were missing). I had to download these missing files one by one and make sure I got the folder path correct for each fie. I then used WinRAR to patch the downloaded files into the main corrupted RAR file (if you are wondering about free alternatives, 7-Zip at least will NOT work, I tried). I scanned all files for virus before doing the patch, for precaution.Crossing my fingers I tried the install again and it worked! So now I'm able to play the game and hopefully it is good and makes me not regret going through so much trouble to get it working. By the way, EA's activation methods for both the game and the DLC are a pain in the backside. Not streamlined at all. I don't mind DRM, but if you want to do it, make it easier on the people who paid for your product.A few last comments, mostly to Amazon:1. You have the money to develop a download manager that checks for file integrity before jumping into the installation and can try to patch any issues if there is a problem. So do it! Games are only getting bigger and file corruption issues can only get worse.2. Do check the file you are selling. Maybe it was EA/Bioware that gave you a junk file to upload, but either way, you are the one selling it so make sure it's in good condition.",1,"Buyer beware, you may not be able to even install the game",1325894400,"01 7, 2012"

Unlike some of the Retron models, it's compatible with most all SNES and NES games, the wired controllers are quite good, it's cheaper than many other retro consoles, and it's smaller to boot. On the other hand, it offers only ports for SNES controllers and its own, so NES controllers and accessories like the Zapper won't work (so no Duck Hunt on this thing). The Duo is very lightweight, which combined with its lack of eject buttons for either slot makes removing and inserting cartridges a bit of a chore.

Don't get  me wrong HOS still has that great polish that Blizzard puts into all of their games, a good balance for the races, a fleshed out storyline and the usual quality they put into their products but it is still lacking in several areas with their old trappings from SC2 back again, only much more this time around.I really don't like how HOS is constantly holding your hand the entire time. I never felt like I got to really chose my own strategies and I constantly felt like Blizzard was right there holding my hand and telling me what to do. Every mission you are guided along being told which place you need to build on, which unit to use, how to use it, what you need to accomplish and such. Some missions do give you a bit of freedom but for the most part you are directed on what to do. I just wish I had more freedom in more stages of the game because to me that's what a strategy game is, getting to use strategy and come up with ways to win and it just isn't that much fun when the game is always telling me what strategy to use. I never felt like I got to stretch the old brain out and flex it somewhat with the game doing your thinking for you. You can definitely tell this is from Blizzard because hand holding has become their thing even like World of Warcraft is based around quests and dialogue that guide you, tell you exactly where to go and what to do when you get there with even raid encounters telling you what to do and warning you before a boss does some special attack. The entire time I'm playing HOS I just feel like it's one great big training level that never fully removes the training wheels. Age of empires or civilization would hold your hand but it wasn't long before those games would let go and let you go off on your own. HOS feels like an overprotective mother that won't stop looking over your shoulder.""Hero units"" are also a bit overplayed. While it is cool to occasionally play as someone that's very powerful with unique abilities it does get tiring when you spend the majority of game playing as one. Actually building, evolving, creating units and such always take a backseat when you control a hero unit. The missions where you actually have to mine resources, create troops, upgrade them and so on like you would in any other strategy game are in the minority here as usually you have to play as Kerrigan, and a ship and other hero I wont mention for sake of not spoiling anything. Even the missions where I got to play as the hero as well as my regular units I found regular units to be pointless really since I could easily finish any mission with the hero without alone and sometimes found bothering with making other units pointless and that to me seems like lazy design.The storyline which at its core was good and an interesting continuation it feels overly padded that gets a little long in the tooth after awhile. It had some great ideas in it that I enjoyed but there was too much of it constantly being shoved in my face. I don't always need every single detail of everything that's happening no matter how insignificant explained to me. The problem is a lot of the dialogue in the game just feels so needless and doesn't make me feel like I'm learning anything because it just feels pointless a lot of the time. I'm all for extra story and dialogue if it helps you feel more ""in the games universe"" because characterization is important but when it just seems like filler to pad out the game it means nothing to me.I felt too rushed in most missions. It always seemed like there was a timer, or there was always something forcing me to constantly be moving ahead. Either I'm going to be destroyed, some beam is going to kill me unless I slow it down, a giant ship is heading my way, the enemy is going to escape, I have to gather something before the enemy does or something else. Which being rushed goes back to lack of freedom and lack of the ability to use strategy since those missions usually just mean you bulk up on troops and run out as fast as you can. I mean a good timed mission can invoke a sense of urgency and make you sweat a little but when you get 4 or 5 of them in a row, or every other mission is timed it gets old real fast.And maybe this is just me but I felt like there was no strategy in the game at all. There wasn't a mission I couldn't easily finish using just the hero unit with hit and run tactics, or just creating a mass of some regular unit and running across the stage. I mean I tried to use strategy and plan things out but honestly I had to force myself to do that, and forcing myself to use strategy is a sign of poor design because the game didn't present me a challenge by properly setting the stage and forcing me to think outside the box or use tactics. The game basically just sets it up so you can overrun everything easily. Like the game dishonored, sure I could run through and kill everyone but I could also use tactics and take the long way by sneaking and each option was viable and each option was fun. It was fun to go in guns blazing, it was also great fun planning my routes and avoiding detection but in HOTS neither plowing through everything or trying to be tactful was very much fun.This is a game worth playing but I can't recommend it for more than 20 bucks.",2,I feel like Blizzard is holding my hand the entire time.,1363564800,"03 18, 2013"

8403,91904,A12WZTC4YJ8ZEC,B000UU5T7E,Ethan D Van Vorst,"[1, 3]","Long have I been a fan of the Fallout series of games. From the first moment I watched Vault 13's cartoon door slide shut in the Fallout 1 (1997)intro I was hooked on this amazing post-nuclear apocalyptic world inhabited by the Vault Dweller, Super Mutants, cyber-punk Raiders, and the enigmatic Brotherhood of Steel. The series is known for its retro-futuristic look, using art deco of the 1950's in everything from the look of clothes and billboards to the designs of some of the cars you'll find scattered across the wastes, gory body explosions, as well as for its biting sense of dark humor. Having played Fallout 1 & 2 and Fallout Tactics repeatedly I was very much looking forward to Fallout3. Like others I was a bit concerned since I consider the Fallout franchise as firmly belonging to the good people of (the now defunct) Black Isle Studios. But Bethesda picked up the reins and really ran forward with it in a stunning way, let me tell you. I was also a bit antsy about picking up this game as a number of the initial reviews indicated there were terrible bug issues involved, thus my prolonged wait before purchasing.The setting for Fallout3 is that 200 years after the nukes flew one of the last Vaults (a series of underground fallout shelters in which humanity's best and brightest were kept safe from radiation and would, in theory, emerge years afterwards to restart civilization), Vault 101, to open its doors to the Wastes. The game begins with your birth and introduction to your dad, voiced by Liam Neeson. As time passes in the Vault you grow to maturity, taking on a job, a love interest in the Overseer's daughter, Amata, and an inquisitive nature like Dad's. Then one morning you're awakened by a panicked Amata informing you that your Dad has opened the Vault's seals and has exited the Vault against the Overseer's wishes. What's worse is that the guards are on their way to kill you and are hot on Amata's heels. Forced to leave the Vault prematurely the player is then thrust into the post-nuclear wasteland of Washington DC. And this is where the game really picks up steam of it's own accord and just runs like a finely tuned machine.The player uses the trademarked S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system to track attributes (that's Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck) as well as a fairly diverse skill set system (Energy Weapons, Lockpicking, Science, etc). At it's heart Fallout 3, like it's predecessors, is a very hardcore RPG, but this particular one is also designed as somewhat of a shooter. And the fusion of the two is very well done. The player is allowed to either shoot at enemies in the traditional aim/shoot method using the target pipper or they can use the new V.A.T.S. system (Vault-Assisted Targetting System), which basically allows the player to stop time and pick out specific areas on the enemy target, like limbs, torso, and head. Depending upon how many Action Points you have you can fire more shots. That, in turn, is contingent upon how many points one places in Agility. Everything meshes together like this in the SPECIAL system, and it's an utterly fantastic way to super-specialize your character to whatever play style you like. I like to play the Brainiac who is pretty good with a Laser Rifle and a set of Lockpicks. Others might like the highly mobile Thief with a knack for quietly subduing enemies with a knife, while others might just like to play buff monsters who just blow through the game by putting their fists through opponents on a regular basis. The sky is the limit, and all Fallout games (Fallout3 is no different in this regard) allow that kind of latitude towards players. In addition to this, previous Fallout games were designed so that every 3 levels the player was given a ""Perk"", or a special boon given to them from a long list of Perks which would help them in their travels (and usually combat). Here the player receives a Perk every level. I like!Some more items about the game. First off the play area is absolutely *vast*, or at least is made to feel that way. Yes, one could theoretically walk from one side of the play area to the other in about 30 minutes (barring encounters) but don't let this mislead you. There are dozens of secret nooks and crannies just waiting to be explored and it pays to do so. On top of this the quest system is fairly well done. One can always follow the primary quest to its completion, although I would definitely recommend some of the side quests as they add an incredible amount of flavor to the game. Some of the quests are not ""official"" ones and require usually that you go to a certain NPC and turn in a certain type of asset (Scrap Metal, Sugar Bombs, etc) for small amounts of exp. and money.Exploration is an absolute must with Fallout3. For my money it simply did not get better than the Mall, and the Technology Museum in particular. I think this was supposed to be representative of the Smithsonian's Air and Space museum but sort of cobbled together it and the American History museum. Either way seeing the remains of the Wright Flyer, the ""Virgo II"" Lunar Lander, and a P-51 Mustang hanging from the ceiling was a rush, and I spent the several hours I spent inside walking from display to display and reading all of the notes on the various items which once occupied those spaces. I actually sat down to watch the little mini-movie in the Planetarium before the fool thing went kaput. :) There are parts of the Mall I still haven't been to (the Capitol Building remains unexplored for me)...the White House *should* be there somewhere, but I was not able to find it. I did find Arlington and spent some time looking around there as well, and you'll find that just looking around the ruins of what once was can be a somber and somewhat sobering experience. I felt actual sadness at some of the ruins of the landmarks I came across, having visited a number of them in my trips to DC in the past. It is a powerful game that can pull off evoking an emotion from you of this type, and I've come across very few that can successfully do it.The PipBoy arm attachment is just plain handy and I found the night-light function to be useful beyond words. And I absolutely loved listening to 1950's era period music while I played the game, and it doesn't get much better than having two Ink Spots songs in the lineup. I wonder if there might be a way to add songs to the playlist manually. Does anyone know? If you do, please leave a comment!The game is not without it's fair share of problems though. Bullet point time! (SPOILERS AHEAD!)-The player level caps at 20. This just plain sucks. Previous Fallout games were such that one could theoretically get to level 99 if they really wanted to (and had a gargantuan level of patience) and there were a ton of benefits to doing so. Here the player has no choice...once you hit 20 you're done.-The dark humor which was so prevalent in the first two games is almost non-existent here. Don't get me wrong, occasionally you'll find the zippy one-liner to fire off at an NPC during a conversation but it's nowhere near as common, and that detracts from the game for me. Gallows humor is part and parcel with Fallout and when it's not there it doesn't feel right.-Some of the quests aren't quite working right. The one which comes immediately to mind is the Tenpenny Tower quest, in which you have to convince the rich denizens of the closed community of Tenpenny Tower to take on 3 Ghouls (super irradiated humans with extended lifespans but unfortunately hideous appearance). The quest requires that I spend time telling people that they either let the Ghouls move in or they move out. Uh..who am I to be ordering them about like this? They have a right to live there in whatever fashion they want and it is *not* my place to push my opinion on them so forcefully.  Meanwhile they have legitimate concerns about Ghouls moving into the tower, primarily their receiving physical harm (or worse) at the hands of the Ghouls. I convince them to let the Ghouls move in and what happens? The Ghouls end up killing every one of them! I felt sick when I realized what had happened. The folks at Bethesda were trying to make a political statement about ""bigots"" and ""racists"" but unintentionally proved that the same ""bigots"" were absolutely right about their misgivings. Any attempt to ""fix"" the problem (killing the offending and completely unrepentant Ghouls) results in my having lost Karma. Hello? I'm sorry, but this quest alone really torqued me in a way that few other games or quests have done in a very long time and I needed to air it.-Some of the Energy Weapons are a tad bit underpowered. A Laser Pistol should attack with at least a 10. Bare minimum. But it has the same stopping power as a 10mm Pistol. Now that's not right. *shakes head*. The Plasma Rifle makes up for this a great deal, and the Alien Blaster is like a handheld howitzer. But those are fairly uncommon weapons and this doesn't make up for what feels like a serious issue with calculating prospective damage.-The ending is very anti-climactic. The last leg of the game involves the player joining the Brotherhood of Steel and following them through southern DC in what can only be described as one of the most magnificent displays of battlefield mayhem I've ever had on my PC. I loaded it up again just so I could experience the giant Robot saying ""Die Communists!"" and ""Communism is a temporary setback!"" as it inexorably rampaged through Enclave lines (I think I was pumping my fist repeatedly in the air during this segment and laughing gleefully and chanting, ""USA! USA! USA!"" :D). This is then followed by a thoroughly underwhelming ending in which it's quite likely the player is going to end up sacrificing themselves to make sure that Project Purity succeeds. And the fruit of my 40-50 hours of labor? A brief 3-4 minute slide show describing how my sacrifice enabled the eventual rebuilding of humanity. Uh...if I just helped ensure unlimited fresh water for the wastes and I've been forced to look at nothing but shades of grey and brown for the entire game, then I am all but *entitled* to see the bluish splash of fresh water and not just shown the door.All problems aside though Fallout3 is a wonderful game which I could not help but love. During my 40+ hours of play I remember thinking, ""this is just the most fun I have had with a PC game in a really long time"". I'm told that there will very soon be downloadable content which will raise the level cap to 30 (an improvement, but not a ""fix"") and includes several new quests. The Fallout Universe is so rife with opportunity and potential that it's an absolute wonder to me that no one has yet made a Fallout MMORPG. This game is surely made for that kind of thing.

I consider that old version (FF III) more fun to play than this. I haven't played FF since then. I'm only 4 chapters deep into this game and I accomplish that in less than 3 hours of playing. Its basically one straight path of killing stuff to end the story for that chapter. Along the way, there's like dozens of save points. At each save point, you can buy stuff or upgrade your weapons(and there's not much stuff to buy). Again, I only finish 4 chapters in this game and I'm not impress. Fighting is too simple since you will be selecting auto battle most of the time (at least that's what I've been doing). If your main character dies, the game is over. You may retry the battle or reload from last saved point. What's the point of having potions that can resurrect fallen player then? I mean, there's one or two other characters that is helping you fight. Why can't I go to them to heal my fallen character (maybe I can switch characters later in the game, but that would be stupid. They should of had that option straight from the beginning). Another thing I hate is that you can only equip your guys with one weapon and one bracelet. One weapon I understand, but people can wear more than one bracelet on them.The only thing great about this game is graphics. Other than that, it is literally boring and stupid. The acting or voices is really annoying. I rather put the TV on mute than to listen to these characters talk.Bottom line: This game makes no sense at all! No free world to explore. No towns or shops to buy stuff (come on, buy stuff at save point? that's so boring and too easy). Too much cut scenes. Will this game be more fun if I keep playing or would it be the same throughout?

It was just enough fun that I was willing to put up with the view swinging around wildly whenever I moved the mouse, and I was even willing to put up with dying dozens of times while trying to figure out how to get through particular sequences, but the last straw was when I got to the spot where I'm chasing some creature and I end up in kind of a pit where the only way out seems to be climbing a tree, and for the life of me I could not do it no matter how hard I tried. Jumping up on branches of the tree while trying to move the mouse as little as possible because it tends to fling you around, all while listening to intense music and a voice in your head pushing you to move as fast as possible, is a great formula for severe frustration.

I have bought every accessory and have been very pleased by all of them, including the wireless internet receiver and the HD-DVD drive.  The graphics in Gears of War look better than anything on any other system, PS3 included (which I also own).  However, despite taking the best care of my system and using it only once in a while, it has died with a hardware malfunction after only six months.  I have become a member of the ""Red Ring Of Death"", when three flashing portions of the console's Ring of Light denote that the hardware has failed.  Despite Microsoft's instructions and my best efforts, it would not work again.The only thing that keeps me from cursing Microsoft's name is that they recently extended the warranty on the 360 from 90 days to one year, and that retroactively applies so that my console, purchased in late Spring of 2006, is now within warranty once again.  So after a call to Microsoft this past weekend they are sending me a pre-paid UPS package so I can ship my console to get fixed at  no charge.  I cannot say how disappointing it is to have a $400 machine, with $300 in extra components purchased, just up and stop working one day.  I think more and more people are experiencing this, which is why Microsoft has extended the warranty.

It leaves little to be wanted, except maybe more.  Multiplayer is fantastic on the XBOX Live.  Literally hundreds of thousands of players online at any given time, quick pick up, and somehow it seems like the players are really just there to enjoy the game.  Great board design (though I would still love to see Blood Gulch and Sidewinder recreated) that enables some outright slug-fests and nail biting finishes.  The campaign takes everything you loved from Halo 1 like the environment, fun vehicle combat, creepy Flood, and the fun to fight Covenant, and combines it with the beauty and fluid control of Halo 2.  Thankfully you don't have to play the Arbiter in Halo 3, which I felt drew too much away from the true story, Spartan 117 and the human conflict.  Add in bubble shields, the flame thrower, two more grenade types, and heavy weapons you can rip from their mounts and carry around!?

2269,8620,A36UKFV79879MD,B000035Y7H,BX Lounger,"[0, 0]","Street Fighter II made such a huge impact in the arcade scene and video games in general. The first game in the series made a little bit of noise and had a cult following leading up to the release of the second game to the arcades. Who knew that history was being made as SF II gave birth to the fighting game genre and revolutionized video games at the same time. Everyone went crazy as soon as they played this game to death while mastering all of the characters' moves, combos & strategies; players were sharing what they knew or found out between each other. No other arcade game had such a deep and devoted following and created tournament style gaming like Street Fighter II. Then, Capcom shocked everyone by announcing a port of Street Fighter II was coming to the SNES and it was released in 1992. This port was revolutionary for its time because while Capcom made changes to the game, the core essence remained and it was still as fun to play as it was in the arcades.Street Fighter II is a fighting game where you face off against the computer in a series of matches that lead up to the game's main villain, M. Bison. You choose from one of eight characters, face off against the other 7 characters, then you go up against 4 boss characters (including M. Bison.) Each character has his/her own storyline and ending so you find out their specific reasons for wanting to fight M. Bison. After every third match, you enter a bonus stage where you get to earn additional points before the timer runs out (there are 3 bonus stages in total.) The game features a 2 player vs. mode so you can take on another human player but you can only choose from the 8 characters and not the additional boss characters. Finally, there is an option screen where you can change the buttons on your controller, play audio tracks from the game and adjust the difficulty level of the game. As an added bonus, there's a code you can use where both players can use the same character in a match.The PROS: This was revolutionary because they took an arcade game that was 58 megabits in size and shrunk it down into a 16 mega-bit cartridge. While changes were made, it looked and sounded close to what the arcade game was. On top of that, the controls were perfect. The game used every button on the SNES controller so Capcom did not have to compromise the button scheme at all. The rules of the arcade game were the same as the SNES port so you weren't missing out at all as far as how your character moves or what strategies to use against the computer or another human player. The same character code was such a sweet bonus as it was NOT featured in the Street Fighter II arcade game.The CONS: Like I said before, this is not a perfect port. In order for the game to retain the same feel, Capcom had to make changes across the board for this game to fit and work properly. There are too many to list but it doesn't hurt the overall experience too much as there were people who never got the chance to play it in the arcades. For them, buying this game for the SNES was a perfect way to find out what the hype was all about. What is surprising is that when you put the difficulty level to its highest point, it is 100 times harder than the arcade game so only the most skilled SF players were able to defeat M. Bison at the highest difficulty level.It was a great time to have the SNES as Capcom would release a port of Street Fighter II: Champion Edition for the Sega Genesis more than a year after Street Fighter II was released for the SNES. Not only did fighting games become popular, but the gap between the quality of arcade games and their ports to home consoles became smaller and it was starting to become common to see popular arcade games ported to SNES, Genesis, etc. If by chance, you have never played any of the earlier Street Fighter II games, you can either pick up a used SNES copy, look for the numerous Street Fighter anthology collections that are out there or download this title for the Wii via their Virtual Console service for 800 points (US $8.)

I have waited almost 10 years for this sequel and to say I didnt have some expectations, is an understatement.How can I express myself sincerely without trying to be pretentious or destructive, other than to say Fallout 3 is the most disappointing rebirth since Star Wars.Fallout 3 abandons everything that made the original 1 and 2 cult classics. The new gaming company Bethesda that took this project failed in almost every way. And it all came down to one denominator, Bethesda thinks its audience is dumb.The algorithmic nature of the original RPG combat system is ultimately replaced with a first person shooting interface. To make this worse, its a clunky, unresponsive and rigid first person shooter. Almost unplayable if you are used to the fluidity of games like Call of Duty, Crysis, Half-Life.As a gimmick alternative to appease old fans, a new VAST system is optional which allows you to freeze and select the next course of action.Firslty pointless because it resumes to normal FPS shooting following its execution and secondly why really bother. What is the point of the statistical nature of this game if you can just point and shoot.The once brilliant dark humor is absolutely absent in Fallout 3s' dialogue and general environment. This makes a major part of the gaming interaction laborious and trickles down to create stale side quests. I always believed Fallout was part comedy, a colorful reflection on the nuances of our society albeit a parallel one. It shaped the game's memorable art concept. What Bethesda have contrived is a generic post apocalyptic world, plain and gritty, much like the game's new personality.The graphics itself has been completely overated. As I look onto the desolate landscapes, i am totally shocked by what others have applauded. The water, lighting and motion effects are grainy and lifeless. Just look at the sky.!. It looks 16-BIT.  The games graphic engine predates all of this years FPS releases. I run a 4870x2 card, on ultimate high settings.The very hyped consequential nature of its gameplay is merely a two option approach made out to be something more. You either do the good thing.. or the bad thing. This is mindblowing for people who are used to the linearity of games like Half Life etc. but its an insult to the expansive experience of the prequels before it.Ultimtaley war apparently changes. The combat, the nature, the atmosphere, the experience. It all changes. And it changes for the worse. It changes for the sake of appealing to a wider, dumber audience.

Rarely has a game achieved so much hype, and as of late, any game that HAS been this hyped has been met with mixed reviews, or initial enthusiasm followed by general revile (cases in point: Assassin's Creed and GTA IV)so Killzone 2 has a whole lot to lose.Does Killzone 2 live up to the hype? In my opinion,it does. BUT: I firmly believe that all the hype all these months...all the expectations really did was detract from this game really shining out. The fact that this game has been in the public's eye for so long sort of puts a damper on its release, I think. But considering the game, whether or not the release is as successful as warranted by so much hype is really immaterial.-Graphics- this game looks awesome. Does it awe as much as it did a few years ago? Not really. Since then MGS4 came out, Gears 2 came out, Uncharted came out.... this game ranks up there with the best looking games, but it's not THE best looking game... that's really subjective, I think.... how good a game looks.-Sound- The music swells and epic tracks really surprised me on this one. It really got the job done to set the mood, but the voice acting was really, really bad on most parts. Some parts, like Scolar Visari and Radec were really well acted, but for the most part, awful; good thing the acting doesn't really detract from this game. The background noises I think are top notch, and I think they set a bar for other games with a lot of fighting and shooting going on in the background from now on.-Gameplay- The game feels tight; I still don't know what people are complaining about the controls feeling weird or floaty....then again, I'm already used to the Sony controller, so that might have something to do with it.... I do have my issues with the campaign gameplay: the game...freezes while saving/loading??? What? I know the game started being produced a while ago, but come on! Freezing? Then why not a 'Loading' screen? Because it's last gen, that's why. Freezing isn't that much better. The other thing would be the incredibly retarded AI. Allow me to specify: the ALLIED AI. The enemy AI is incredibly shrewd, and they cheat, hehehe. You'll be hard pressed to think before you rush any hallway. But your squad mates...boy....they sure die a lot. And then you have to revive them etc.... it gets annoying.  The campaign is pretty good, very fun, and so far, as far as length goes, it's longer than CoD4, so...it might be short (haven't finished it yet) but don't knock it because it's not RPG length. Either way, the MP will have you hooked. A lot of people have looked for a game to replace CoD4 as the mp fps par excellence.... and have been let down repeatedly. I think this game might be it. Although, truth be told, they are just two very different MP experiences....if I had to compare what it feels like to play KZ2 online, I would compare it to Warhawk before I compared it to CoD4. Plus, the classes  give KZ2  a depth the perks don't really achieve: with a perk, and unlocking guns, you can turn yourself into a tank, or be almost invisible, or be a demo expert etc....and you might run around with the P90 while some poor sap has the Mp5 because he's just starting out (the MP5 is a very good weapon, not knocking it  =P  ), but being a different class sort of puts everyone on the level. Since it's clan based, there's also a push for team work in every match you play...something that simply didn't ever happen for me in CoD4.- Storyline- Umm...what storyline?? Honestly, this game has all the storyline in the opening credits and towards the end. About 5-6 missions in the middle make you  go through the motions of killing stuff without any real plot point to justify it. It's really sad because the game DOES have a storyline...it's not the GREATEST storyline ever, but it's a fun one, kind of exciting....but it was paced horribly. Then again....if I had to compare this game to a movie...I'd compare it to either Rambo II or I dunno.. Starship Troopers. Both simply awful movies if you take into context cinema as an art form....but if you see them as what they are (namely, action flicks) then... what's there to complain?! Heck, all this game lacked was some sex and cigar smoking!Overall, this game will have me quite occupied in the coming months. It's funny too....

Story wasn't too good, ending left me kinda confused & kinda frustrated I just spent hours of my life on this.  No worries right? I bought it for multiplayer, but no I found myself in deja vu.  Did I mistakenly buy halo 2 again and just not realize it?  I must have, otherwise it would be much better...The forge is cool for sure, the graphics are kinda better (I have HD so don't tell me I didn't fully experience it, look at GeOW, COD4, Mass Effect, Asassins Creed, Bioshock, the list goes on... and then try to tell me why Halo 3 is even made for a next gen console???).  The multiplayer is a smoother interface overall no doubt, the weapon balance is tweaked for the better, I'm so glad they brough back the assault rifle but they effed it up and made it as powerful as a supersoaker, and the deployable weapons are fun, but it's just Halo 2 the way it should have been the first time if it wasn't rushed.

Long ago, I went to a friend's house, I played it, and it was complete crap. There was virtually nothing good to speak. All it does is ooze unimaginable tortures that only feel like you are being punished by God for some sin you've committed. Being repenting immediately, you're going to need it.WHAT THE GAME IS: It is a game show game. You pick a character and you play a trivia/mini-game show called Do Unto Others!, and you suffer for every minute (Wait no, every second) of this game show hell abomination. You play crappy mini-games, answer difficult Old Testament questions (Over 1,500 in total... Lord, please end my misery), you will despise the host of the show, and be extremely bored.... ALL AT THE SAME TIME, YAY!!!GRAPHICS: These textures are awful and the graphics just look bad for a PS2 game from 2005. AND WHY THE HELL DO ALL THE CHARACTERS LOOK LIKE THEY'VE BEEN INJECTED WITH FREAKING BOTOX?! ALL THEY DO IS SMILE, AND IT'S REALLY CREEPY.MUSIC: This is one of this game's only saving graces. The songs from Christian bands are actually decent and aren't bad to listen to.SOUND: You will wish Chuck Norris would appear on the screen and kill this host. Seriously, he's the kind of character you want to take out back and shoot.GAMEPLAY: The controls don't work all that well and really hamper the mini-games and makes them even more torturous to play. Answering questions does not require any precision to control, you just choose one answer. The only moment of joy you will ever get out of this sack of s*** game is when one of your opponents gets Wrath of God and loses all their points, and you will probably laugh at them like; ""Ha, Ha, you lost all your points, dumbass!,"" but then get enraged when you lose all your points; ""Dammit! What the f***?!,"".OVERALL: Here's what you do. If you have an old Xbox, go buy the game show game Whacked!, in which you kill your opponents to win and enjoy the experience. There is nothing good to be had from this piece of crap, and there are much better games to invest in on the Playstation 2 than this. If you want to teach your kids good Christian values take them to church, get them involved in youth groups, etc. GOT THAT? Don't ever buy this game for your kids, DON'T EVER.

4327,180900,A2KQDT7WF3ITP7,B0050SVNP8,"Joseph Sayre ""Venom Computing""","[9, 12]","As one of those pitiable, old souls who played Pokemon when it was first released, back in the days of Gameboy, I've participated in every single rendition of the Pokemon RPG series, Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Platinum, Ruby, Sapphire, Crystal, Fire Red, Leaf Green, Diamond, Pearl, Heart Gold, Soul Silver, Black, White, and now this: Pokemon Black 2.I do suppose you have to ask exactly what this is. Each rendition of Pokemon usually gets a name, and seeing as though GRAY might have been the color chosen, I can see why a sequel was instead used. But, again, what IS this game? Why does it exist? Is it better than Black or White? Is it truly a sequel? Is it worth getting for full price?Well, no.You see, the same answer should be said for all of the ""Sequels"" in the series bar the remakes, in that the same world, the story doesn't change all that much and basically, you'd get pretty much the same level of entertainment, with a few extras, playing what is basically an EXPANSION, for the cost of the full game. Black and White 2 are no different in this regard.Black and White 2 take place 2 years after the events of Black and White, if you haven't played the first game, don't worry though because the previous plot is not necessary to be known to enjoy the game, however, it does provide background that will add to B/W 2's plot. In this instance, you and your rival once again take on the baddies, and amass a team of super powered creatures to wage battle to save the world, and become the champion of Unova, and collect data on all the Pokemon ever.So what's wrong here? Quite simply, the game isn't fresh, it doesn't have the steam that its predecessors have, and that's due, in part to a few new problems the newer versions have.First of all the newer versions of the game like to get excessively lost in the storyline, now, this isn't so much an issue with some as it is with me, personally reading 10-20 minute monologues is tedious, and because nothing in Pokemon is ever actually ""said"" the developers constantly having you read a small novel whenever any kind of interactivity with NPCs is on the screen relating to the story is actually pretty boring. Sit down and read read read, with the occasional, step or something happening. The addition of the Xtrancseiver Has not aided this, and now many plot points come in through telephone calls that are often very inconsequential, and I'll admit annoying. Being able to see the character does not make it entertaining, this is in sharp contrast to the phone in previous games where you could pretty much ignore calls. I also think the tutorial steps in the games has gotten close to a lunatic level, everything must be explained, at length. Seriously, Gamefreak, give us our Teachy TV back , if we want tutorials we'll go there. There is simply no reason to stall a new game for an hour while you're forced to fumble about doing mundane stuff you've done in the previous games a thousand times in order to earn silence. Seriously, give us our running shoes, our stuff, and a lv 7 version of whatever we've chosen and start us off in front of our house with the tutorial crap out of the way. All it takes is an option in the start up menu after naming your avatar.The problem is that the main fanbase is returning again and again to be told the same thing, and its tedious, and unneccesary.The second problem is this generation's Pokemon, with the exception of a few, This might be the biggest set of uninspired nonsense so far, with Pokemon like Trubbish, Patrat, Woobat, and Vanillite to utter a few, combined with that, the weakest starters ever return in this game, with literally all three starters failing to capture even a tiny fragment of the magic the first few games hold. I can't explain how much more difficult this makes playing the game, since you won't run into pretty much ANY of the types the starters offer within the first few towns worth anything, and since the starters are so lame, you'll want to replace your ""special"" starter pokemon, almost instantly. Tepig is let's face it, a Pig, and therefore, however awesome his evolutions become, isn't all that good, but believe it or not is likely the best option, as Snivy has almost no potency or moves and is outclassed by gross number of grass types, and Oshawott is simply tragic due to his evolution and abysmal, well, everything. Of course this is an opinion, but do not expect any sort of metagame use like that of Charizard, Typhlosion, or even Blaziken from any of the new contenders, once again cementing use of previous pokemon created over ten years ago as the stuff people flock to. And this is surprisingly where Black 2 stands out from Black. Pokemon in Unova have been modified to include some of the other 600+ rather than just the Unovan-dex like in Black and White. While there just aren't enough good ones early on to make a team you'll stick with, this is par the course for Pokemon and through the game you'll have many opportunities to refine your team into a respectable crew of soldiers with which to do battle.Unfortunately save Black and White 2's additions to the Pokemon in Unova, and the inclusion of more interesting characters, it still feels more deja-vu than anything, the locations haven't changed much, and the ones that have aren't explored long enough to have memorable value, and so the game comes down with a case of repetition and thanks to its over exuberant use of monologue and tutorials, it REALLY drags through the beginning, hitting a height somewhere before the final, then completely falling flat again into the metagame, where there is surprisingly little to do. There are  a few extra towns you visited in Black and White, but nothing new, and the ability to get some ubers. Finally there is the Elite Four again and that's pretty much it.Nintendo WFC has gotten minor upgrades, but there isn't much to write home about, but online remains a steady, difficult set of powerful trainers and stingy traders, and while Nintendo have made trading easier, a search function would have been far more useful in trades if we could search by words we put in ourselves, I can't look up pokemon unless I've seen them, which means I can't trade for them unless I can see them in my game (since the search uses the PKMN field which is tied to your pokedex) So to reiterate, online is very good, but still has a long way to go, and for GOD'S SAKE GET RID OF FRIEND CODES.Black 2 and White 2 are great games, and are much better if you HAVEN'T played either Black 1 or White 1. Even if you have played those titles they're good games, they're free of bugs for the most part, and all of the things in the game are clear, easy to use and the series has refined the battle system to such an extent, I can't find a single hole in it. The story of Black 2, which is more mundane than that of the first game, the rival, who is much more relatable, doesn't do a good enough job to bring you BACK to Unova. The Starters still stink, much of the Unova Brood is rather pointless and you'll readily find yourself passing them by in favor of the injected oldies. The game simply talks too much and doesn't get going quick enough and when it does, it can't keep it up too long. Finally and most importantly, the Metagame is far too undeveloped, and most of the activities can be completed in a couple of hours, unlike Gold and Silver which had an ENTIRE SEPARATE REGION to explore after the first. The problem is everything comes to a head, and just finishes up all at once, leaving a few straggling things to do and only a few new places to explore. The thing is, Black 2 still feels like an expansion, not a new game, but it's far too insistent on pushing its story, which is not progressive, and only mildly interesting. There are times in the story where the game comes to a complete halt and you won't know why, forcing you to do something somewhere that wasn't communicated very well. The final nail in the coffin is how easy it is, there is practically no challenge to be had, your creatures will decimate almost anything, the game doesn't even really get hard into the metagame, with powerful trainers you'll easily take down included. Nothing stands out like the Red battle from Gold and Silver, the boosted elite fours of old, or even some metagame content in Black or White. Black 2 is a Pokemon game, but it's a bit of a bore to drag yourself through, it is an ok game, but it's hard for me to recommend.",3,Leave the travel ticket to Unova on your desk this time.,1378857600,"09 11, 2013"

I have been playing football since the good old days of Techmo Bowl on plain old vanilla Ninentendo.  This years Madden is just not that great.Why do I say this?  Well, for one, the graphics aren't really that good.  The new default angle is from such a far away vantage point that you can see the whole field, but, it also makes everything looked horribly pixelated.  There is a lot some full screen anti-aliasing could do for this picture, especially when you consider how small the screen and therefore the resolution must be already.  You can change this somewhat with the ""zoom"" camera mode, but this mode makes it kind of difficult to see where your receivers are since, it drops the angle of view down to almost horizontal.  The other views either make the graphics look awful, or don't help with gameplay.The other thing, which is similar to the NCAA 09 ""freshman mode"" is the oversimplification of this game in order to widen their market.  It was not too bad an idea with NCAA 09, but I doubt it would widen the appeal of Madden fans with a 'basic' set of controls, since it is the competitive spirit which makes you try to learn the controls and get better.  If you like to quit when you can't ""get"" a game, then you don't have the kind of competitve drive needed to be a Madden addict, and you will probably get bored with the game quickly.Almost all other aspects of the game are the same as last year, with the exception of not turning the angle of the camera around when playing defense.  People like me have been used to your team staring off at the bottom of the screen no matter offense or defense for so long that this is just plain annoying.  I mean, it totally changes the thumb motion on the d-pad to the less natural down motion, and it makes it more difficult to judge your players position in space by having him up at the top of the screen where he the field is narrower and he is smaller.I could understand this if the game no longer paused every time you made an interception, but it still does!  So, how does changing the angle get you more ""immersed"" into the game?  It doesn't!  It makes it more difficult, and now the game pauses a moment when you make an interception, which is lame, and it doesn't have that awe inspiring rotation of the screen, which makes things more dramatic!Things are still clearly not immersive in the fact that you pause when you make an interception.  Rarely, in live games that I have seen do they pause the live action when that happens, therefore, this is very non immersive.  But, if they could pause the live game and rotate the screen like they do in Madden, it would be very appealing to fans watching the game.This isn't a bad game.  The controls are different, the graphics are awful, and it lacks some of the things that made playing Madden more fun, and it is now accessible to idiots.  Sounds like something a loyal fan would just eat up, right?  Well, the sound track is better, and I like the new rosters, and the stadium graphics have improved.  Overall, this is an ok game.  They took a few small steps forward, and a few more noticble steps backward.The only reason I am not giving it 2 stars, is the fact that I don't want to sound like one of those whiners who complain every year.

Not in it's epic scale is it lacking, for it is epic. What sticks most for me is the fact that they, for some reason, broke the parry system. Which ruins the combat for me. They tried to re-invent the GOW combat system, and screwed it up. I played the game for an hour, upgraded my blades so that I could parry, only to realize that I now must push 2 buttons simultaneously in order to parry. What?! This is junk! What were they thinking? Half the time I end up jumping instead of parrying, and it really bites you when fighting the Gorgons. Which is a good reason not to incorporate the jump button with the block button! They have also put a delay on the parry and evade movements, which utterly baffles me. There's some magic window where you have to pull it off. Good luck figuring that out before smashing your controller, or snapping the game disc in two. I've been with this series since the start, and this entry has THE worst combat of them all! Imagine if in Punch-Out on the NES there was a delay in blocking and dodging, you would probably lose to Glass Joe. Glass Joe! I have to say though, why is the ability to parry so damned taboo? They should allow the player to do it from the start. As it is a blocking and timing skill, plus it makes the combat so much more rewarding. Why for the love of God did they have to mess that up? It was next to perfect the way it was. By far the best parry system in gaming. It made the combat flow so beautifully. It was so well crafted that I could play any GOW game on the hardest level and never feel overwhelmed. This is no longer true. Now you have to stop combat, block, and while blocking waiting for an enemy to attack, you hit X when the enemy strikes. It may not sound bad, but compared to previous GOW games, it sucks. It's sad to say, but in a series whose main focus is combat, this new parry system turns what was once a hallmark standard in gaming into just another big budget button masher. I seriously beat the first boss of the game with my freaking eyes closed mashing the square button! I also need to mention the ""Rage Meter"". In a word, it's crap. It takes too long to build up, and runs out too fast. Additionally it locks away your best combos. Until you fill that meter you're forced to spam the same short combos over and over. I suppose they had to change the parry system because they also screwed up the way enemies fight. In past games there would be an obvious tell for when an enemy would strike, their weapon would glow or sparkle, and their movement would be obvious enough to see amidst all the chaos on screen. Not this time around. Beating this game was such a chore. Like finishing a bad meal, every bite becoming worse. I didn't pre-order this game a year ago to be this let down, but here we are. Lastly, what is up with Kratos' lanky out of scale arms and hands? Michael Phelps would be jealous. Kratos could probably out swim a Kraken with those ropey swim strokes. Most people seem to just love this game, which tells me the next one is probably still going to have the same busted combat system. If this proves true, I'll be sitting it out. I don't need to waste my time, money, and patience on another half-assed GOW game. It's just another example of a game that should have spent more time in testing and development. I'm positive anyone would be happy to wait a little longer, if it meant an end result that lived up to the time and energy put into the series by developers and fans alike. I'm just very disappointed. I feel like an appendage on one of Kratos' enemies. Ripped off!",3,The God of Mediocrity.,1363824000,"03 21, 2013"

You get a large rogue's gallery to beat up and buy as well, including villains typically associated as other heroes' antagonists (such as Sinestro opposite Green Lantern).The game is big (bigger by far than Hogwarts) and will take a long time to complete so it is well worth the $$ that you'll put down.  There are the typical glitches that we find in all of the LEGO games, including system freezes, but I didn't come across these as much as I did in the Harry Potter games.Recommended for both the LEGO and Batman and DC heroes fans.

The story eventually gets interesting enough to keep your attention (and there is a story, which is a rarity for many MMOs these days). The world is quite large and well-done, and you're not bogged down by a boring shooting gallery of trash mobs.On the downside, I was confused by how the classes blend together at first (you select a class but then can equip whatever you want, although it's best to equip a little of every type of ability/armor), but once you get used to it, I suppose the flexibility is liberating. I also didn't like how the game drops you in the middle of nowhere as an amnesiac with uncertain loyalties - I much prefer how most MMOs let you know who and what you're fighting for. The interface is very different from other MMOs (very RPG-like) and while there's a lot to explore, there aren't nearly enough quests to feel like you have the freedom to go where you want and do what you want. You're very much on rails.On the PvP side, there's one PvP zone and it's monstrously huge - so monstrously huge that it's impossible to get anywhere or do anything by yourself. I just don't like oversized WPvP - I prefer the instanced PvP of games like WoW that don't waste your time running everywhere and force you to group into artificial teams and battle against castles and NPCs.Overall, I'd say there's a lot of potential here, but it lacks a lot of polish and doesn't play as well for an MMO as it should. Even more than SWTOR, the game - with its amorphous class roles, separate stories and no obvious prompting to group for most of the content - plays better as a single player RPG than an MMO. Still, it's a lot of fun so far, but there's simply not enough content to warrant a subscription for this MMO. It should be a regular RPG with a co-op option, because it's a horrible failure as an MMO.",2,I'm not sure about this game - but I think it should be F2P,1398384000,"04 25, 2014"

Bryant,"[2, 3]","Bejeweled Twist has players selecting four jewels at a time and rotating them in order to make the 3, 4 and 5 jewel combinations that draw points and special pieces.  Had I never played Blitz before (available and quite popular as a free application on Facebook or as a paid app for iPods/iPhones through the Apple App Store) then I'm sure I would have just loved this.  Instead, I found myself missing the more frantic pace of the 1 minute timer, and the zone one has to get into in order to rack up really large combinations, bonuses and points.  Because of the interface here, the whole game slows down.  You're not just grabbing a single jewel and flipping it one direction or another, you're selecting with the pen and then rotating with buttons, and it just takes a bit longer to get done what you need to.  Of course, that will be appealing to those that appreciate more methodical (perhaps even more thoughtful) play.  So what I find less attractive about this version may be exactly what appeals most about it to you.So consider your style of play, perhaps even play one of the many free versions online, and absolutely feel good about this version as a buy if a slower rhythm to the game is desirable.  It's highly polished, has a great interface, works well within the confines and features of the DS, and at its core is a classic and celebrated game.

(After I received the purchase, I actually found a better price through a STEAM download.)  The real problem was post-installation compatibility issues given the &#34;Games for Windows LIVE&#34; requirements.  I tried to use the disk through my own GFWL account but couldn't get it to work because GFWL was been discontinued by MicroSoft within the past year.  Who knew? Apparently STEAM purchased the GFWL rights and now runs those games through a STEAM interface or something like that.  Anywho, I finally got the game to run but it didn't SAVE any progress so the game always restarted from the beginning.  Bummer.  After a lot of internet searches, I finally came across a STEAM discussion thread that addressed the concern via a software patch that addressed  the GFWL requirements (let's just call it the Xbox &#34;fake out&#34; patch).  I then tried to reinstall the game through STEAM as suggested but the installation code was not accepted !!!  Huh?  It appears that the game disk was not new as described even though it arrived sealed in plastic.  Its installation code was already active and assigned to someone else's ex-GFWL account.

3906,10760,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00004SVVH,S. Rhodes,"[5, 7]","As a kid, I actually somewhat enjoyed this game.  It came to Nintendo's virtual console, so I decided why not download it for a change?  After all, in the late 80's early 90's I really enjoyed this game.  It was really something to have.  Years later it's apparent of two things: The game was horribly designed, and it CAN'T stand the test of time.  The fact that on Nintendo's VC it's also a dollar more than the other NES games is also questioning.  It's hard to make a game this bad.If you were a fan of the Turtles a long time ago back in the early 90's the first thing you'll notice about the game is that it hardly has anything to do with the show at all outside of some of the major characters.  Outside of that there are no foot soldiers, and most of the enemies you encounter you never saw in the show in the first place.  You will come across Bebop and Rocksteady but none of the other enemies were actually ever in the show in the first place.  Kind of daunting.What really makes the game horrible, however, lies within the gameplay.  Firstly, the turtles themselves are unbalanced and put to unfair use.  You can switch between any of the turtles at a time, but for the most part, only one of them is of any use to getting you through the adventure.  Michaelangelo and Raphael are completely useless, as their weapons lack to the range to actually do anything.  Leonardo is alright, but Donatello is the only real useful one here, as he's the only one who can attack downward and at a range.  More than likely you'll only want to use the other three to sacrifice so that Donatello can do some beating up on enemies.The way the levels are designed is also horrendous.  You basically walk around an overworld map and go into sewers, warehouses and whatnot.  The problem is that you never know where to go next.  This non-linear style wouldn't be so bad if there weren't so many blasted dead ends.  To make the experience even more grueling, the game is just FULL of enemies that will respawn almost the second you turn around.  You could go through a tough warehouse fighting tons of tough enemies, only to find you can't go any further.  So now you'll have to backtrack and you may have to fight all those enemies again.  So if you don't lose a turtle getting to a dead end, you'll probably lose him getting from it.The game isn't really difficult, it's just unfair and frustrating.  The fact that two of your four players are completely useless tells you something.  The later turtles games were far better than this.  Skip the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.  It's so unfair that the experience is frustrating.  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II and III were far better, and there's still no turtles game that beats the all time best: Turtles IV: Turtles in Time.

In a nutshell America turns into a sort of future retro 1950's  that erupts into a nuclear war about 2075.  Two hundred years later the survivors come out of the fallout shelters into the new world.In Fallout 3 you started out from a shelter (called a Vault); in ""New Vegas"" you begin in the outside world, as a courier who is gravely wounded and enters the game as someone with no memory trying to find an identity.Along the way you can make choices, ally with factions, obtain sidekicks, and so on. There is no one way to play the game, nor good or bad choices.  Developers have tried to shy away from having ""good and evil"" character sets for something more realistic.  In ""Mass effect,"" for example, you can be a Paragon (virtuous but unyielding) or a Renegade (self adsorbed but doing what has to be done).  In ""New Vegas"" (and the prior Fallout games) you have a negative or positive karma, but it's applied to how certain factions view you, and to please one often ticks off another.It's something developers try to do is make a sequel that is bigger and better than the original. Well they did that, but it may also be the game's downfall. My time on completing it with most quests discovered and siding with one faction was 51 hours, almost twice what it was Fallout 3.  To have tried to see how different faction choices played out would easily added another 20 hours.  Overall I spent a few weeks on it, but looking back I honestly can't say I enjoyed it.  The problems I had with the game are best run off as list:A future where the economy runs on bottle caps (?) and despite 200 years of post apocalypse environment computers are still up and running; a 2075 computer looks an awful lot like 1980.  This was also in Fallout 3.If anything too many quests and complexity.  To get one thing done you have to see someone who gives you three quests, and in turn someone else on one of those quests give you more, and so on.  There is a LOT of searching and looking around, and the pointer telling you where to go is really only good for a general heading in the wasteland.  Many of the vaults and casinos are literally mazes to find your way around in.  This also results in things like you enter a room, surprise someone and get into a fight and kill them, then get a message you failed a quest you were never on as it depends on some decisions you made a few quests ago.Navigating the wasteland can be difficult as you try to get to one place by climbing a ridge and run into a mysterious invisible block as they don't want you getting over it. A lot of ""boss"" characters have the HHF (Huge Hitpoint Factor) where it takes multiple hits with a grenade launcher or a sniper rifle to take them down, despite looking like any other character in the game.As with Fallout 3 everything has a vague cartoony look and the color palette is a dull somber shading of browns, tans, greens, greys, and so on.  I realize this is a wasteland but still a depressing landscape makes a depressing game.Really?  Follow ons to the Roman Legions and Mongol hordes?The characters are nothing more than general roles (leader, follower, medic, seller, comic, etc.) with a repertoire of canned lines.  That essentially is most video game characters but in many you identify with them as if a from a book or movie, they seem real even if they aren't.  Here it just all runs together.  It doesn't help that so many canned lines are repeated over and over.The ending, however is what finally soured me on the game.  Without giving it away it's a slideshow of about 25 or so vignettes; with from 4 to 6 variations depending on how you played each major part of the game.  Some may never be present if you missed  that set of quests.  Therefore there is no ""cutscene"" at the ending, and easily a few hundred variations.  Some turn out the way you expected, many were ""well if I'd known *that* I would never have played it that way.""Basically I entered a confused and uncertain mess, expended an enormous amount of effort, and left the place an even more uncertain mess.  Call it ""real"" or too much like reality, it felt more like a performance review than ending a game.If you want to see a story done right that is involving, colorful, and still a large world to play in with a surprise ending, look at ""Bioshock Infinite.""

3248,36983,A31RNA84IZABHK,B00008J7NZ,"Lipplog ""lipplog""","[15, 39]","I'm a huge fan of the first Halo which I bought over a year ago for my computer and I STILL play online on a weekly basis. Sure, the story and structure of the campaign itself are lifted from the original Half Life, but as Picasso once said, ""Good artists borrow, great artists steal."" And while Halo's Campaign was great, the Multiplayer was even better.So when Halo 2 came out, I willingly fell into Microsoft's monopoly trap and bought an Xbox figuring the year it would take for it to come out on my computer would be unbearable. Boy what a disappointment. Here's why...REASON #1: THE CURSE OF THE VAPID SEQUELHalo 2 campaign offers nothing new in terms of plot. Just a rehash of the same battles with the Covenant Aliens and some Flood zombies who seem a bit superfluous to the convoluted story-line. Sure you can now hold two weapons instead of just one, and you spend half the game as a covenant alien. But these are really superficial gimmicks. There was nothing substantially different or new to this game.REASON # 2: MICRO$HAFTFirst off, I had no idea Microsoft would actually have the nerve to charge me 10 dollars a month in order to play online. There isn't one PC game that charges me to play online. Why? Because I already pay my cable company for that! So why would Microsoft charge me for a service they don't even provide? Have you read the papers? That's what Microsoft is best at. Charging you for whatever they want because if you don't like it, and want to go somewhere else, you can't. Because they have so much capitol from previous monopolies, they can buy out an entire company for just one single game and only release that game for their own consoles. Which leads to my third disappointment with Halo 2...Reason #3: MICROSOFT MEDIOCRITYBungie designed the interface of the first Halo and it's simple and intuitive. Wanna play online? Hit MULTIPLAYER and then hit SEARCH. Boom! A list of games going on all over the world appear on your screen, listed by server name, game map, game type (capture the flag, slayer, etc), number of players allowed, number of player slots available and server ping speed.In Halo 2, designed by the counter-intuitive geniuses at Microsoft this time rather than Bungie, you can't choose your map, you can't choose your server, or even your specific game type. They choose for you. Sound familiar?And the final reason I am disappointed by Halo 2, it's trite, but I'm passionate about it. Whether I have a head set or not, I am forced to listen to all the stupid, racist, sexist, childish, moronic comments the rest of the world decides to blurt from their ADD-inflicted mouths through my speaker system.At least in Halo 1, all the neo-nazi crap came in the form of text messaging which was easy to ignore as it was fast flying in the corner of your screen. But you can't block out voices without losing all your sound.Sorry guys, some of you might love this new version of Halo, but I'm going back to play Half Life 2 again, a sequel equal to the original.

For those people who love John Woo action shoot them up with two pistols, The Matrix type action with Oozies or Sincity/Frank Miller Comic Books - this game is just that! With a brilliant Frank Miller type storyline and action that makes many action movies look bad, this game is a must own for any die hard action fan. This is a third person view type game though, but it does makes sense in that it would be the only way to see all the action in a cinematic movie viewpoint. This is the first game to introduce the new concept of bullet time. Bullet time is the idea where when the action gets so involved and gritty that the motion of the battles goes into slow motion mode (example: Neo in Matrix when he dodges bullets in slow motion) You actually see the bullets fly passed you as you jump back with two pistols blazing and scraping the enemy just as his bullets carves away paint on the walls. The graphics for this game surpasses any other game - even surpasses games such as Half-Life and Alice. There were several instances during gameplay that I forgot that everything wasn't real and that it was 3D sculpted. Perhaps most of the graphics are created in 3D Studio Max - which gives the game its realistic Hollywood movie look. Gameplay is excellent and there are many weapons to choose from (Single and twin Baretta's, single and twin Ingram Oozies, Pump action shotgun, Sawed-off shotgun, Sniper rifle, grenade launcher, molotov bottles, grenades, machine gun rifles, baseball bat, etc...) The game even features mods that you can make yourself and levels that can be designed by you. I believe there was a mod at (website address) that has a Face/Off level with speeding boats and face off shootouts in churches; and another mod with the Matrix lobby shootout with Neo and Trinity blasting away guards. This mod has even twice more the weapons than the game ordinarily has - including a kung-fu feature where you can do Backflip kicks, kung-fu roundhouses and kicks, and jump kicks all while holding your weapon. For people who are thinking - ""but this is a third person view type game like Resident Evil!,"" think again - there is a mod that can be downloaded that enables you to play in first person view/shooter much like that of quake and unreal (You can even have picture in picture of both views at once) This game is definitely for people who cannot get enough of cool John Woo and Matrix type action movies.

10653,105292,AGCDNTPBJ8JTG,B0016N4A7E,,"[109, 127]","In 2005, F.E.A.R. was an incredible experience for me. I loved the combat, loved the story, loved the scares. Which makes this experience all the more painful several years later. Simply put, F.E.A.R. 2 continues the trend of making console ports into PC games, and it's once again a tragic failure.I will not delve on the story, except to say surprisingly few of the main characters from F.E.A.R. are in there. Sure, a certain little girl roams the halls of this new release, but other than that there is not a whole lot of the First Encounter Assault Recon team in this ""F.E.A.R."" experience. The story is also quite short, even on the hardest setting, but I suppose this is the trend nowadays. Or perhaps it is for another reason, like the glaringly dumbed-downed enemy AI, or the lack of an ""extreme"" difficulty setting like its predecessor had.Which brings me to the laundry list of problems with this game for PC gaming. For starters, the AI pales in comparison to the original. At first I was disappointed that they took the ability to lean out of the game (especially because the enemies can still use this forbidden feature), but then I realized that it was so easy to best the AI in combat it didn't matter. And be careful when using that slow-motion, because it causes the enemies to light up with a glow effect reminiscent of Assassin's Creed, in case you had any trouble shooting them before. Overall, combat is not nearly as polished or as fun as F.E.A.R. The new cover system? Might be helpful if anything you took cover behind actually fit the player; instead, most of your body is still exposed.And the list of egregious errors continues. There is horrible letterboxing across the top and the bottom of the screen if you do not play on a 16:9 display, meaning all monitors of standard 4:3 and widescreens of 16:10 will be out in the cold. There is a film grain which, when played at the highest resolutions, looks absolutely atrocious and ruins the depth of the graphics, which are a tad dated to begin with. Shadows are glitchy at best: sometimes they appear for certain items, sometimes not, in multiplayer never. The clumsy HUD takes up almost the entire screen. And the best part about all these mistakes? There are no options to disable them. The lack of customization in this game is laughable- it's far more restrictive than the original!But these are mostly cosmetic fallacies- the real deal-breakers are far more critical. For example, you cannot save/load from wherever you want, but merely from a series of checkpoints. In a PC first-person shooter. Are you serious? This is an extremely visible error that screams console implementation and in no way should be included in a computer game. Want to map your extra mouse buttons as in the original? Not possible. But even that is a relatively small affair compared to the multiplayer woes of this game. In short, there are no dedicated server files or anti-cheat measures. That's right: a game which requires Steam to install and run has no real servers, merely hosted games running on other people's machines. This might be fine for an XBOX or PS3, but it is completely unacceptable in 2009 for a game to have a watered-down MP experience far worse than its 2005 predecessor. Fortunately, if and when you get MP to work it is a pretty forgettable experience. No leaning, no slow-motion, no real difference between F.E.A.R. 2 multiplayer and any other shooter. Call of Duty 4 runs circles around what this games ""multiplayer"" claims to be. Bottom-line: F.E.A.R. 2 has console multiplayer, and it's utterly absurd on a PC.Overall, F.E.A.R. 2 is, simply put, the biggest disappointment for a sequel which I can recall in the last decade. Even Far Cry 2 didn't make some of the more tragic development errors F.E.A.R. 2 is chock-full of. Taking the huge PC community which loved F.E.A.R. and giving them a bargain-bin console port is the only thing that really scares me about this game. Monolith, normally a pretty reliable outfit, has gone the way of many other developers and gone after the casual console crowd with this one, and it's a shame.People who pay one, two, three, or even four-thousand dollars plus on a computer system do not want to play a game that they could have played on a console for a couple hundred. They want the ambiance and feel of the original F.E.A.R., not some watered down garbage that caters to the more simplistic crowd. Sure, the game is scary at times, and yes, the graphics can look good given the right circumstances, but this is nothing like F.E.A.R. Gone is the intelligent combat. Gone is the legitimate feeling of fear. Gone is any chance of a multiplayer community. And, perhaps worst, gone is my fifty dollars on a game I expected to be the best shooter of 2009.Save your money and your fond memories of the original F.E.A.R. This might as well be the Activision/Blizzard version- the one with the same name but none of the same feel. Monolith should have just left the name as Project Origin and not tarnished the good name of the F.E.A.R. franchise with this console mess.

Better to tie the Enter key to the ""X"" button than to maybe also take a few minutes and tie the mouse click to it, too.The other thing I'm writing the review for is to warn you that support for the PC appears to be almost nonexistent.

The facial animations, the character movements, and the city of Seattle are all quite a sight to behold. Your smoke powers sizzle and your neon abilities leave the citizens of Tron looking on in envy at just how bright you are. Outside of the visuals though, the game handles very well. It never dips below 30fps and, paradoxically, actually increases frames per second when more action is on the screen (What witchcraft is this Sucker Punch?)Your character is a lot more vertically inclined this time around and the parkour elements have been toned down. On a personal note that doesn't affect my overall score for this game, the main character makes me feel old for the first time in 30+ years of gaming. He just comes off as such a teenager it absolutely kicks me right in the age.Now, compared to Infamous and Infamous 2, your character has more abilities and handles more fluidly, however, the city of Seattle, while pretty, is a lot smaller than the other two games and you can probably knock out ever single thing there is to do in this game (blast hidden cameras, chase down secret agents, eliminate all DUP forces, spray paint buildings, etc) and the main plot in about 30 hours and plow through the main game segment alone in less than ten hours.For sixty dollars you get an adequate amount of game, but little to no reason to start it all over again and go the evil path except for differences in cutscenes.All in all, it is a fun, georgous game, but it feels like it has about 2/3 the content of the previous title in terms of areas to explore and stuff to do.",4,"Absolutely stunning, but lacking compared to its predecessors",1395446400,"03 22, 2014"

Yes, it is ancient, but it still as addictive as ever.I bought this game just for Robotron 2084, but I think the problem I had with Robotron probably extends to other games as well.As a person who is intimately familiar with computing and programming, the main problem with these games is that the PS3 is way too powerful for these games.Well that's good right? No, the games have way more computing power than they are designed for. The consequence is that the Robotron's enemies are FAR too powerful even in the easiest settings. Take the tank scene.

Krueger,"[9, 9]","From reading the reviews here, I was not expecting much with this game, but it turned out to be one of the better games I've played in a while.  Graphics are quite good, very short learning curve, simple keyboard control setup, and smooth glitch-free operation (except for the glitch mentioned below).The game takes place in modern times, but with a mythological theme, so there are both human and monster-like enemies.  Weapons are typical for a decent FPS.  Pistols, assault rifles (with scopes), submachine guns, shotguns, frame throwers, rocket launchers, and grenades.  Aside from the ammo stashes, you can also pick up weapons from dead enemies.Health is restored by killing the mythological creatures and absorbing their ""animus"".  You can use the animus to restore your health or as a type of close-range weapon that will stun enemies.  In fact, some enemies must be stunned before you can kill them.  The non-human enemies cover the traditional range of swarming little parasites to huge building-sized monsters.While I didn't pay a huge amount of attention to the story line, it seemed about average and the voice acting was not bad.  You often have team members running around with you, but they are autonomous.  They tend to wind up being cannon fodder.  I thought the setting was very well designed with some novel, though not particularly challenging, environmental puzzles.  For those who find linear games boring, this is probably not for them.  Personally, I don't have anything against linear games.This game does not allow the player to save his progress.  It uses the checkpoint system whereby the game automatically saves periodically.  That means that, if you die, you will be set back to the most recent checkpoint.  Some of the checkpoints are spaced pretty far apart, so you could wind up playing some sections over repeatedly.  This wasn't a huge problem in this game, but there were a couple times that I wished they were a bit closer together.  I played on normal difficulty and I don't know if other difficulty settings change the frequency of the checkpoints.  Lack of manual save capability was the main factor that kept me from awarding five stars to this game.I found the game to be on the longish side of average length.  It seems like many newer games are quite short, so it was nice that it took a while to get through this.This game has one serious glitch.  Toward the end, you are to take an elevator to the roof of a building.  When you step into the elevator, you get stuck and eventually die.  I'm sure not everyone has this problem, but I don't know what triggers it.  The answer for me was to change the MaxSmoothedFrameRate parameter in the file PandoraEngine.ini from 300 to 30.  You will find the file under C:\Documents and Settings\My documents\My Games\Legendary\PandoraGame\Config\PandoraEngine.ini  I found this solution using a web search.  I don't know if it will work for everyone.  After making the change, you can set it back after you get to the next checkpoint.Over all, I found the game to be a lot of fun and visually interesting.  While not a big fan of having super-natural powers (as with the animus in this game) this game kept it simple and useful.  I paid $6 (plus shipping) for the game and found it to be one of the better bargains I've some across lately.  I highly recommend this game.",4,This game deserves a higher average rating than it's received,1259020800,"11 24, 2009"

The sun glare effect was bad and when it rained it was stupid with it's horible color system.  This game however has really realistic and good looking rain with nice sunsets.  This game has the best graphics in the sereies and the most to offer.  You can work out to get buffed or chow down to get fat but this game has something for everyone.  There's a lot of hidden stuff in the game you can do.  For instance you can play a game of basketball or play a mini video game in cj's home.  You can also shoot pool and gamble in the later stages of the game.  The radio stations are the best so far with commentating by andy dick and music by rage against the machine, ice t, snoop doggy dog, NWA, guns and roses, and a nice selection of reggae so there's music for the average rock fan or your average rap fan.

9629,81278,A15F7ACDRTWXO1,B000NJFMUQ,"Chutzpuh ""The last PC gamer""","[6, 8]","Before I start let me say I really wanted this game to be good, I really did.  This is likely why I gave it so many chances to redeem itself, only to see it fall flat on its face.To be fair, it does look good.  On the highest quality it approaches Oblivion, almost but not quite.  It does have a storyline and a plot, not good ones mind you but still more than Oblivion ever managed to offer.  It offers lots of open ended play, and will keep you entertained for many hours.Sadly, this game is completely undone by the gameplay itself.  Let me elaborate.  You start the game by customizing the level of ugliness you want your human male main character to have.  No option for additional races or even for a female character.  Just several slidebars to adjust things like hair style, lip size and whatnot.  If this sounds like Oblivion, it should, this game merely uses a badly constructed, shameless ripoff of the creation system Oblivion used.After giving up on ever making a character you can stand to look at, you may start the game.  The game start off with some battle fundamentals, thus introducing you to the horribly broken system of combat.  Essentially, you use the same three hit combo over and over.  After finishing the combo, you will stand there uselessly for a second or two and allow the enemy to pummel you senseless, at which point you begin again.  You cannot block or even fight while moving, the best you can do is hop backwards.  This fancy little dodge is more of an insult than anything.  Many times I attempted to jump back to avoid being hit only to be nailed anyway and stand there uselessly for a second.  At times, combat is so slow and jerky you feel like you are playing a turned based game.After seeing combat, you are then introduced to the amazing world of voice acting, or rather the lack of it.  The acting is terrible and completely drags you out of the game.  The use of ""Thees"" and ""Thous"" gets annoying very fast and brings you to reply ""Forsooth, you all sound like morons.""  Shakespeare never wielded a sword, casted a fireball or met even a single troll, please don't make characters sound like him.  The main characters voice is terrible.  I have no idea why they casted such a terrible person for the part.  After hearing him speak for more than three seconds I would have scratched the voice portion of the game altogether.The world of the game is rather large, so horses are provided for your use.  Sadly, I don't think the game designers have ever been near a horse.  They handle terribly, react slowly, and get stuck on nearly every object you encounter.  They even come to a full stop when you try to run downhill.  The horrible bugginess of the horses in the game finally caused me to swear the things off and walk from that point on.While the list of things I hated about the game can go on for hours, I think I will bring up one last killing fact then call it good.  Game balance.  I really dislike the fact that I could wade through an entire melee against countless enemies completely unscathed only to catch one arrow in my plate-armored back and be killed instantly.  Or worse, to be attacked by enemies that can kill you in one hit.  These two events happen about five to ten minutes into the game by the way.Wrapping up, Two Worlds had the potential to become the next Oblivion.  The addition of a plot and storyline was exactly what Oblivion needed, and I had hopes that this game would do it.  The complete failure of creating a sensible battle system or even balancing the weapons and monsters makes this game gut-wrenching to sit through.  Add the last blow to the head known as terrible scripts and voice acting, and you get one amazing pile of salty garbage which we may now call Two Worlds.",2,What a shiny pile of junk this turned out to be,1197849600,"12 17, 2007"

There's no fantasy or sci-fi element, it's uniquely raw and unformulated.  Rather than having unlimited ammo, sexy allure and sharp wit to get you through, you have only have to rely on your own inituitive, quick planning, stealth and skill.  Your actions also have consequences and you're enemies are just as intelligent and determined as you and your allies.If you also consider the context -  if this is real - it could be very scary and emotional.  You're in a vast foreign environment and you could be killed instantly if you're not careful.  Just imagine that this is what soldiers really experience (obviously worse in reality).  This is a very provocative and insightful gaming experience which really teaches the player about the 'real world' (to a certain extent)...This, in a way, is a form of escapism from other more conventional and mindless video games.  It's nice to have a bit of a change and this isn't likely to influence a new notion of 'reality-based' gaming anyway (for those who dislike it).- This is more suitable for older gamers and those with patience who prefer challenging strategy games.

I'm a fan of 3rd person (or over-the-shoulder) action games like this one and it offers a lot of variety.  You get weapons, cool upgrades to those weapons, enjoyable quests and side quests, amazing environments, and even good dialogue (which includes a lot of swearing!).  The game play itself is adaptive in the sense that if you play through an area one way and die somewhere along the route, then replay it a bit differently, you'll find things that played one way prior have changed a bit.  For instance, take too long killing a baddie and he might call out 4 more to help him shoot you dead, but if you kill him quickly enough no additional enemies show up.  I'd recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of the originals, anyone who enjoyed the Uncharted games, or anyone who liked the Batman: Arkham series.  The play is very similar.The controls are easy to learn.The game is LENGTHY!  I really feel like I got my money out of this game.It's not too hard, but not terribly easy either and if you find yourself stuck somewhere Lara herself often helps out.There are a multitude of ways to kill the bad guys and that's a big perk when it comes to variety in game play.It does have a few small things wrong with movement like if you hit a sloped or slanted wall just right you sometimes slide all the way down in a peculiar stance or sometimes you see that classic character/object ""meld"" where your hand or knee or face merges with the object in front or behind or beside you.  There are also moments where the camera angle is wonky where you might find your view totally obstructed by a leaf on a tree or something of that nature however this is easily remedied by moving just a big and adjusting the camera angle.

3781,126213,A32FDGA30QCLRX,B0028IBTL6,S. Posey,"[3, 5]","Fallout New Vegas was by far one of my top anticipated games of 2010. I had the collector's preordered for months in advance and with the hundred + hours spent in Fallout 3, the game couldn't arrive soon enough. When the day came, I had off work and spent a solid 8 hours of gaming in the Mojave Wasteland before turning in for the night. The next day, before going to work, I decided to hop on and explore some while drinking my morning coffee. Unfortunately, I couldn't make it past the loading screen since my save file was corrupted. Without getting into that whole debacle, I eventually restarted the game, avoided the quest ""Come Fly With Me"" and have been save file corruption free since then.I bring up my save file issue because it's something that needs to be said in every review of Fallout New Vegas, the game is broken. If you are a Fallout fanatic like myself, this is nothing new to us. Fallout 3 had bugs galore and New Vegas is no different. I didn't experience any game ending bugs in Fallout 3 and have with New Vegas, but I have heard some people did experience big issues in 3. I just wasn't one of them. Bethesda has released one patch for the PC and Xbox 360 (not sure about PS3) but it didn't fix the big issues. It was mainly for fixing some texture issues and other graphical inconsistencies.  All of the known issues are documented and accounted for and Bethesda is working on it.  When will this come out, no one knows.  But if you take your time in the game and save often with numerous save files, you should be able to complete the game fine.  Just don't do the quest called ""Come Fly With Me.""  I have over 50 saves right now since I create a new one every 20-30 minutes or so to not lose my data.  I recommend you do the same.OK, with that out of the way, I can get into the real review, so here goes...Fallout New Vegas takes place a few years after the events in Fallout 3 and on the west coast, Nevada and it's Mojave desert to be exact.  Vegas was relatively untouched by the bombs that fell during the war so much of the strip's buildings and structures are relatively untouched (except for weathering and wear).  You play as a courier who delivers packages for people.  In the beginning of the game you are caught by a guy in a striped suit and robbed before being shot in the head.  A robot digs you up out of your shallow grave, takes you to the town doctor, and your story begins.  After character creation and stat alignment, you set off to find out why someone tried to kill you and if wanted, exact revenge.  With this simple premise, the story will branch out to numerous sub plots and characters each with their own charm and personality.One of the best features of Fallout NV are the factions.  In the world of Fallout NV, there are two main factions.  The New California Republic (NCR) is basically a new military state government based out of California.  They are moving into Nevada to secure Hoover Dam because of it's power capabilities (running water).  Their opposing force is a band of slavers called Caesar's Legion.  These guys come from the East and rape and pillage their way across the land.  But, looks can be deceiving and they actually have a layer of complexity to them if you decide to check them out.  They too are trying to control Hoover Dam and a large scale battle is on the horizon that you will be able to influence depending on who you side with.  Along with the two main factions, there are a number of other minor classes that you can raise your standing with including The King's (Elvis impersonators who run Freeside), the Khans, White Glove Society, and many more.  They each have their own hierarchical society and you can work with them or against them to meet or fail at their goals.  Choice plays a huge part in Fallout games and NV is no different.  Your choice in what happens plays a big role in how the world will turn out.While Fallout New Vegas is an RPG at heart, it also has a combat system.  If you aren't familiar with the mechanics, you can choose from a number of weapons and depending on the stats you choose each level and corresponding perks - small boosts to different aspects of your character you gain ever 2 levels - you can have varying success with each weapon.  Most characters pick a weapon type and stick to it.  For instance, I always go with rifles.  As a result, I have a high gun and agility stat and my perks usually have to do with 2 handed weapon accuracy and extra action points since 2H weapons use more.  You could go with a melee based character, energy weapons, one handed gun wielder, or even bare fisted.  The choice is yours.Another aspect of combat is the VATS system.  VATS can be summed up by calling it a statistical auto shoot.  By hitting a button, you bring up a screen that shows percentages over different body parts on your enemy.  The stats have to do with your proficiency with the weapon, line of sight, terrain, etc.  Depending on how many action points you have you can fire off multiple shots directed at whatever limb you want and then fire.  The resulting explosion of body parts, especially with the bloody mess perk, never gets old - even after seeing it well over a couple hundred times since Fallout 3.  If VATS isn't your thing though, a new feature, iron sights, has been added.  This is the typical scope view in other FPS games and works well in Fallout NV.  I find myself using both with harder enemies getting VATS treatment.Something that people really loved about Fallout 3 but wasn't really prominent was the use of allies or companions.  In Fallout New Vegas, they are a mainstay.  You'll meet people throughout your travels who will agree to come with you and fight by your side.  You can give them orders, have them carry your extra equipment, and talk to them and receive quests.  It's a great addition and it works well, when it works.  It's not exactly broken as much as it is buggy.  Sometimes you'll move from one area to the next and your companion is nowhere to be found.  Other times they won't attack and will randomly teleport back to where you found them.  It doesn't happen a lot, but it does happen.  There are a lot of companions in the game and you can travel with them all, but only one at a time.  You may only have one humanoid companion and one robotic companion travel with you.  The rest can hang out back in your hotel room at the Lucky 38 while they wait for you.  Some of the companions are well voiced too with Felicia Day doing the voice work for one of my favorites, Veronica the Brotherhood of Steel Scribe.  The companions really help out in a fight as well with most carrying their weight.  All xp gained from their attacks even goes to you as well so don't feel shy to use them.  Nothing but good could come from the arrangement.Another new feature added into Fallout New Vegas is hardcore mode.  In this mode, the game isn't as friendly as it would be in normal Fallout mode.  For instance, using stimpacks in the regular game heals you instantly for X amount of health points.  In hardcore mode, they heal over time.  So, if you are in a firefight, you can't rely on that extra boost of health.  You also need to sleep daily and feed your character or you will suffer the consequences.  One good thing about this mode is that it can really be for everyone.  You can play hardcore mode on the easiest difficulty setting and still get that hardcore experience without the punishing difficulty of a higher setting.  Plus, there is an achievement for finishing the game using hardcore mode so this is good news for achievement hunters.One thing I did notice in Fallout New Vegas more so that in Fallout 3 was the quality of the story.  Even side quests are extremely well written and really make you feel that you are in this desolate land and exploring it first hand.  The characters have life and depth and the voice work is phenomenal.  In between missions, I find myself just randomly walking the wastelands with my companions looking for new places to visit and experience.  The world feels so lived in while also being desolate that it just asks for exploring.  This leads me to my next point - the graphics.It's not hard to notice that the graphics aren't the best in a Fallout game.  The engine is getting old now and it's starting to show it's age.  That doesn't mean you can't be sucked into the story though, far from it.  The graphics of this world do a good job supporting the story and making you feel that you are in a world where a war took place and the remnants of human civilization are clinging on for dear life.  The skyline will darken in the evening resulting in the glow of New Vegas to be seen on the horizon.  The ambiance of creatures unknown in the distance make the hair on the back of your neck rise.  Enemies yell to their friends to let you know that you're impeding on their territory.  All of this adds to the ambiance of the game world and it works well.  Don't focus on the graphics as you would a Gears of War game, but rather take it for what it is, a supporting role to the story and gameplay - you'll feel right at home.If Fallout New Vegas was completely bug free or at least close to it, there wouldn't be any questions about it - this would be the game of the year for 2010.  It's a shame that technical issues that shouldn't have made it into release hold the experience back for most people.  I've already heard of a number of people who traded in or sold their game after getting the game save corruption bug.  It's not just a few either, the forums are full of people with these sentiments.  But, for those of us who can look past the occasional graphics flare up or take measures to avoid save game corruptions, the result is an amazing feat of gaming that has an excellent story, lovable characters (including the evil ones), and a world which you can truly get lost in.

The smaller protector, where all the touching occurs, inhibits the stylus completely.The work around is to use the smaller protector for the top (not a huge deal) and then TRIM the larger protector to fit the bottom screen.

Its garbage and its recycled garbage at that- the most economical kind (read as: exploitable kind for publishers).  The story is literally broken.  Everything ended after Bioshock presumably with you saving the little sisters or not- everyone is dead you survived- end of story.  Their is no reason to bridge a gap here, none at all.  I've heard rumors about the DRM on the PC version and being an owner of the first game (as well as system shock 1 for DOS and System shock 2) it irked me to some degree that an active connection was required to ""play"" the game I ""payed"" money to own.  Their is no logic here- I ""pay"" for services like cable because I do not own a server warehouse and am not my own internet provider.  So naturally if i buy a product made for a purpose (like a video game or movie) I now am the owner of said product period.  Why should their be the need to ""activate"" a product you've bought?  What if they started doing this with movies, e-books, and cd's?  What would be the general reaction to this?  Probably betrayal and after playing what I had already of Bioshock 2 on a friends PC I'm inclined to say that it was made to turn a buck or two.  Even worse is that its security methods are even more disturbing and riding the line somewhere between retail and digital distribution.

Unfortunately it includes a few big (to me,anyway) missteps that are just plain uncool.The Good: 1. Incredible graphics. I own Assassin's Creed 4 on PS3 and took advantage of Sony's upgrade program to get it on PS4 for $10. The differences are very real and tangible, right from the get-go. From the stubble on Edward Kenway's face to the sight-hindering cannon-smoke during naval battles this game took beautiful to gorgeous on the new system. Call of Duty: Ghosts (while being a bit of a disappointing game) looks simply amazing. Killzone: Shadow Fall gives us players a glimpse at what next generation gaming should look like.2. The system user interface. Unlike many others, I though that the Xross Media Bar was pretty tired and needed some updating. Which Sony has done, in spades. Very intuitive and user friendly; everything I want is right there in front of me.The Bad:  1. Not such a big fan of the DualShock 4 LED light bar remaining on at all times. Can be a little annoying when you're playing Outlast in a dark room and your TV set is reflecting blue light back at you.2. The lack of any real mind-blowing launch titles. Yes, I realize this was a race to get a system on shelves to compete with XBox One, but come on Sony. You could have let your third parties in on the secret a little earlier, maybe?The Ugly:  1. No 3D Blu-Ray playback at launch. While I do realize this is a minor complaint for some people, I actually do enjoy watching the occasional 3D movie on my big, beautiful 3D TV. Which the PS3 has been allowing me to do for ages. Not including this functionality in the PS4 right off the bat is just Sony ignoring what they assume is a very small contingent of their gamers.2. The ever popular backward compatibility issue. Excuse me? My new $400 Sony monolith does not play CD's or MP3 files? Come again? PS3 games are also a no-go? This made some sense back in days that PS2 games were formatted for DVD and PS3 introduced Blu-Ray gaming, but the PS4 STILL USES BLU-RAY. Why am I going to have to wait for some cloud-based pipe dream in order to play games that I already have on disc.

555,159035,A2YSUZ7R9AGJIU,B003O6G6G4,"R. Reining ""Old School Zinger""","[65, 77]","Dragon's Dogma has a lot of things going for it. I think that's why the more I played it, the more frustrating its negative aspects were. Because there were many things I really liked about it, the fact that there are such serious flaws were heartbreaking. Before I get to the meat of the review, let me say that overall I really enjoyed Dragon's Dogma. That being said, if the game is never patched, I will probably never play it again. So on to the review...As I said, there are a lot of aspects of this game that felt original and fresh. The one that should be first on everyone's list of pros is the pawn system. In the game, once you create your character, you then create your main pawn. In the DD universe, pawns are humanoid beings whose sole purpose is to help your character defeat the dragon that has stolen your heart and marked you as the Arisen. Basically what happens is, you design your main pawn, and then if you are playing while connected to XBOX Live, that character is uploaded to a place called The Rift, a gateway that connects you with a wide selection of everyone else's main pawns to recruit, and where other people can recruit your main pawn into their game. The idea itself is just really cool to me. That any pawn I recruit (you can have two on top of your main pawn and yourself) is something that is purely the creation of someone else. Then, your main pawn adventures with other people during their game, and when they are released from another person's party, they/you can choose to send them back with an in-game gift, and you can rate their performance. In this way, your main pawn accumulates more experience on top of what they are gaining in your game. Everything gets updated every time you rest at a camp or inn, and that's when you can receive the gifts from other players. I think this is the single greatest strength to the game, and without it I don't think I'd have enjoyed the game nearly as much. The novelty never wore off, and I still believe the system is fantastic, and the best usage of single player online connectivity I've ever experienced. If you don't play online, no worries, the game either has a set population of scripted pawns you can choose from, or ones that are randomly generated by the game.Second, also a huge positive, is the boss battles. As far as combat goes, this is one of the most original things about the game. Even though none of the functions are new in and of themselves, I've never played a role playing game where you can climb onto a dragon and slash at its heart, or climb onto a cyclops' head and stab its eye, or mount a chimera and cut its snake tail off, and then kill the goat and lion. It's fantastic, and there are plenty of them to be had. It never feels too repetitive either, since there are so many different ways to approach battle with them. It's especially fun once you're a sufficiently high level, because then you are be more inventive and experimental with your approaches.The third noteworthy thing about the game that I loved was the variety and depth of the items. I put 60-70 hours into the game, exploring most of it quite thoroughly, and I know there are probably dozens of items and crafting materials I haven't even found yet. Most enemies drop loot, and there are chests, barrels, crates, plants, minerals, and an assortment of other items to be found, picked up, combined, used to enhance weapons and armor, or just sold for some major cashola. If you played Capcom's awesome Resident Evil 5, you'll be familiar with the inventory and combining system. Except in the case of Dragon's Dogma there are hundreds and hundreds of items to be acquired. It keeps the game feeling fresh when you're interested to find or use various new rare items to enhance weapons and armor. Each weapon and piece of armor in the game has a 3 star tiered rating system. The first tier only costs money to upgrade to. And then the second and third tiers require a specific number of a specific item to upgrade to. The better or more rare the equipment, the more expensive and difficult it will be to find those items.Another worthy mention goes to the landmass of the game itself. The world of Gransys is quite large, even if it isn't terribly varied. Elevation is used frequently to change things up a bit, and it works well, providing long falls for unlucky enemies (or adventurers).So on to the bad parts of the game. There are going to be more than four things listed here, but I still maintain that hidden in the mess that is Dragon's Dogma is a truly good game.There are two main problems with the game, and I could go back and forth about which one is more irritating all night: The (lack of) fast travel, and the way pawns interact with the world.First off, fast travel is almost nonexistent. There are items called Ferrystones that you can carry with you that will instantly teleport you back to the biggest city in the game world. Aside from that, eventually you will also be able to take what's called a Portcrystal with you, which you can set down anywhere in the world and then your Ferrystones will transport you there instead of the city. And that's it. You get one Portcrystal, and aside from that, you can only teleport to the main city. This becomes more frustrating the more you play the game, unless you're a masochist, because the world is quite large. And not only is it quite large, but since the terrain is so varied, you cannot ever travel any great distance in a straight line, so you end up sprinting until you're almost out of breath, and then jogging while your stamina regenerates, and then sprinting again. And over and over and over to your destination. The game tries to provide a couple of shortcuts between areas of the world, but it's really not very helpful. A lot of your time in game will be spent running from one place to another. Not only does this get really grinding after a while, but enemies also respawn in the exact same places every time, so you will have the exact same fights again, and again, and again. And then some more. To the point where I pretty just ran past them and kept going. Because it got so tedious. And then if you don't have a Ferrystone, you have to run all the way back to where you came from. And not only that, butSecondly, your main pawn and the two you can also have with you will repeat the exact same lines of dialog when you hit certain markers in the game. The exact same lines, in the exact spots, every single time. It got so annoying I went to the options to see if I could turn off the voice volume for just the pawns. You can't, unfortunately. If I had a quarter for every time I heard the phrase ""Perhaps we'll find aught of use,"" I would be seriously loaded. The main problems in the game all kind of flow into the other, and they make it quite a big mess. Even just describing it, it probably seems to someone who hasn't played the game like it's really not worth it to even give the game a chance. If you like highly polished games, you might want to pass on this one. So yeah, the pawns get really annoying after a while. If they would just change it so they only spoke when you initiate conversation with them.If Capcom fixed only those two problems, the fast travel and the pawn irritation, the game would easily earn a four star rating from me. However, those aren't the only problems with the game...As stated, fighting normal enemies becomes tedious after a while, because they appear and respawn in the same places every time. It makes that combat repetitive and very boring, even though the combat itself is pretty fun. There are only so many ways you can kill goblins after the four or five hundredth one.Texture pop isn't actually an issue that I noticed in the game. What is an issue though, is people pop. From the start of the game all the way through, I'd find myself running into people because the streets would be empty, and then suddenly three appear, and then ten, and then twenty-five, all of a sudden. It's not so much an irritation as it just feels lazy. There's no way they didn't come across it when they beta-tested it.Lip-syncing is godawful. Which is to say it's laughably bad, or just nonexistent. I don't particularly care if lip-syncing is bad, but this isn't even bad, it's like the already bad lip-syncing wasn't matched the recorded audio, so characters are speaking when their lips aren't moving, and vice versa. Another thing that just felt pretty lazy.Side quests are extremely boring and unoriginal. Most of them fall under two categories: escort missions, and kill set number of [this creature]. Almost all quests not in those categories are main story-related. Kind of disappointing. I think this might be because there are only actually two cities in the whole game world. And no real villages or just lone houses at all. So there aren't quirky people giving you odd quests out in the middle of nowhere.One of the most bizarre things to me about the game was the ""love interest"" aspect. Or lack of, I don't even know. I'm still not sure if it's possible to even have an implied relationship with any of the characters you meet. I think this is one thing that maybe I just don't get, because I'm not a fan of Eastern-style RPG's, and am much more used to there being a clearly defined list of things that can or won't happen in a game as far as role playing relationships. There are a few cutscenes in the game where your character will exchange...let's call them ""significant stares"" with other characters...and then that's it. It's never revisited or mentioned again or anything. And I'm not sure what the point of it is, or what the payoff is either. It's just kind of baffling to me. Music swells and two digital people are staring into each others' eyes not saying anything...and then it ends and nothing.The save system is also lacking. The game only allows one save slot. It autosaves, and you can save when you want as well. But it's all one save file. If it corrupts, you're screwed. I imagine this will be one of the first things addressed if and when there is a patch for the game. But poor design in the first place, and pretty unacceptable for an RPG.The last thing I can mention are the graphics, which I'm only mentioning so I can say that if a game is engrossing enough, graphics really don't matter that much. And in this game, they don't. They are function-only, and it works that way. I'd much rather have this deep and varied universe with pared-down graphics than a gorgeous backdrop with no real substance.So, with so much working against a game, how can I possibly still actually like it? The honest answer is I don't know. I think because the things I like about it outweigh the things I don't like about it, and because I see a ton of potential for this to become a really good franchise if certain simple changes were made. Towards the end of the game I was really reminded of playing Alpha Protocol, which is another highly flawed game that I really liked. So much was wrong with it, and yet I loved it, and saw great potential for it to grow into something really great. That won't happen now, of course, but as with it, I think if Dragon's Dogma gets a sequel, it will be far better than this one as long as a few key things are addressed.If you're on the fence, I would recommend you at least rent the game to see if it's something you'd like. As I said before, I'm convinced there's a really great game buried in this mess. As I did, you will probably alternate between total immersion and utter boredom. In my opinion though, its pros outweigh its innumerable cons.",3,Well that just happened,1341705600,"07 8, 2012"

I've never played a game before with such horribly designed levels, where you fight your way through hordes of bad guys for 2 hours only to find yourself facing a bridge and the WRONG X-Man character to get across it, so you have to start all over at a long-gone save where that particular character is still alive, and someone manage to keep him/her alive long enough to reach the bridge. The camera view is horrible, so that you can only see about 10 feet in front of your characters. There is no way to heal your most vulnerable characters because there are woefully few health drops.  The A.I. controlled X-men characters are so freaking stupid that they'll walk right off a cliff and die, which means you have to constantly switch from your favorite char to one of the idiot A.I. chars to get them in the right place, and they constantly get stuck and are too stupid to jump over little obstacles to keep up with you.  This game is fun when it works, which is only really when you're playing solo or 2-player co-op, when you don't have to deal with the stupid A.I. Overally, I became so frustrated and angry while playing this game that I had to shut it off. Only an X-men fan would give this a 5-star rating because the game levels are a confusing mess, the A.I. is stupid, there are no clues for solving puzzles (like crossing damaged bridges), and you have to use a specific X-men character to solve certain parts of the game, with no warning in advance, and that char probably will die before you reach it.

Gabriel knight 2 uses real actors whom gave a great performance, the use of 3d and going back to Tim Curry in GK3 was going down a step. Gk3 is basically Gk1 in polygonal format with a less interesting backset.I was very dissapointed in the story of this game, in the end after I confirmed the whole story, i said &quot;nice try&quot;. Nice try as in, 'nice try, but the story just doesn't work out'. One thing that makes the GK series good, is gabriel himself. He was protrayed well in this game, because they used Tim Curry as the voice, as they did in GK1. Another character you play in the game is Grace, very frusterating when it comes turn to play her, the game totally changes from fun and comical to extremely boring.

When firing up this game for the first time, I felt the instant placing of the COD franchise on life support. Maybe it's the nail in the coffin it needs. MW3, more than anything, feels like a giant, overpriced MW2 expansion pack. If Activision is willing to put out this LAZY, OUTDATED excuse of a game on the market and sell it full price as if it's a new title, hopefully it will wake people up to the fact that the COD games are now beating a dead horse.Nothing about this game feels inspired. It reeks of laziness, and it ultimately feels like a cash cow more than anything else. The fact that more than one company developed this game shows its embarrassing lack of central vision and connived to put out a half-assed game to make a quick buck. They literally took the same engine and design source from MW2 and added a couple new modes and uninspired maps and called it a new game. Everything is the same: the fonts, the menus, the load screens, the graphics, and I swear some of the voices sounded recycled. Actually, the graphics look worse than MW2's.The multiplayer is a huge disappointment. Multiplayer map design has always been the pride of the COD franchise. However, the variety and creativity of the maps in MW3 are lacking. They're just not that fun. The multiplayer maps in the previous COD games made me continue to play. That means that the maps are designed in a way where you can never play the same way twice. In MW3, all the maps are tight, messy, and ugly. Most of the time you're limited to run-and-gunning and looking for hiding people (ironic for such small maps). While the little tweaks to the killstreak system are a fresh welcome, they don't feel like they have an impact on the match.This game still has its fun moments, if only because of the familiarity; you know what to expect. But it only goes so far with this dinosaur of a game. With the previous COD games, I wanted to come back for more. I don't feel that vibe with this game.

After you do, you find a piece of paper that needs to be translated, so you go to a minigame to translate it.  You play a lot of minigames that make the game interesting and fun.  There are four characters that you are always running into, and in order to talk to them, you have to select correct responses from a list.

The options for questions might be to ask why he had that picture, a goldfish, a tv, a gun, or a diary in his room, and you have to select the right question.  They aren't always that easy, though.  The back of the box boasts of an optional ending, but it is really just a continuation of the first ending, so in the game, there is only one true culprit.Fun-This game is a blast.  You don't really have to use your brain except for a few puzzles, and they aren't that hard.

The art and creativity you find in all the levels and environments is fantastic, and that's what I admired the most as I played.  Nintendo definitely still has ""it"" in terms of putting out creative, original games.  The whole atmosphere is this really happy, whimsical feel that's a real breath of fresh air after playing more realistic games on my PS3.  Sometimes, you want to play something that makes you feel like a kid again, except that with the eyes of an adult you can better appreciate the sort of creative energy it takes to create a game like this.  The game play is similar to other Mario titles, but they've added a fair amount of new tricks and abilities here to freshen it up, with great results.People have criticized this game for being a little too easy, and I think that's valid, especially when compared to Mario 64.  It's pretty straightforward to recover most of the stars, whereas in Mario 64 most of the stars required puzzle solving which is often absent here.  The fights in Mario 64 were also harder.  However, for me this didn't detract from the game much because the art and creativity on display are just so good.  This game really shows what the Wii's hardware can do if used properly.  The game play is still great, it just isn't usually very difficult.Unless you really need a challenge to enjoy a video game, I would strongly recommend this game to you.",5,Great Game,1304380800,"05 3, 2011"

I have always loved Tetris, I always will.  I enjoy the &quot;interactive&quot; backgrounds.  As you progress in levels civilizations rise, jungles grow, and the world develops.  I thought it was a great idea.

It is a good challenge anytime.  There are some nice features in the XBox version, but I personally didn't need them to buy the game.And remember Tetris fans, you will have to get used to some new controls.

While some of the features and options may be temporarily entertaining, the limitations and annoying factors will add up quickly and cause you to turn this game off in disgust.Batting- The batting control for this game is about as frustrating and uncomfortable as you can imagine. No matter what batting option you choose, the timing and the set up will never fit your gameplay. You either hit a foul ball, pop out, or strike out...that's it.Runner On Base- The controls for base running are ridiculous, and the player mentality/awareness is inconsistent and unrealistic. When you do finally get a man on base, be prepared to cringe as he fails to tag up (even though you didn't direct him to advance, ugh!) You will not score many runs in this game.Annoying Comments: Derek Jeter and various old managers will screw up your timing by giving you a &quot;helpful&quot; hint right when you make contact with the ball. Seriously, a suggestion box will pop up in the middle of the screen and interrupt whatever is happening in the game. Even if you turn the comment option off, the comments will continue to appear. Very, very annoying.Graphics: Overall, the graphics could and should be much better. The pitching and batting stances are nice, but these images are just a small part of the entire game. The crowd, homeruns, fielding, etc....these are just a few of the many areas that need to be enhanced.Nice Things: I won't completely dog this game title, as the pitch control, the play-by-play announcing, and the stat upkeep is impressive.

However SA added many features to the gameplay and had a huge environment to explore in. One of the least mentioned features to me, compared to previous GTA titles is the right clicking to aim and shoot. Simple change but makes a significant impact and makes shooting much more precise and the firefights fun. Story wise it is OK, I didnt really get into that whole rap thug stuff. I liked the 80s gangster theme more in Vice City. Graphically it looks pretty good, nothing to complain about. But again, the shooting and firefights were the best thing in SA.

5474,81100,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000NGQ26C,S. Rhodes,"[33, 36]","It's hard to write a review for a Mana game and not talk about Secret of Mana.  A game hailed as not only one of the greatest SNES RPGs out there, but also as one of the greatest RPGs of all time.  Over the years, however, the Mana series has gotten progressively worse while other franchises from Square-Enix continue to be strong.  Dawn of Mana is no exception as it is without a doubt one of the worst Mana games ever.  It seems there will never be another Mana game to hold a candle up to the legacy set by Secret.  It's really sad because Dawn of Mana, like the other Mana games to drop the ball, had a lot of potential to be good.  The developers just didn't do things right.Dawn of Mana centers on a guy named Keldric who is out to save someone named Ritzia from an evil King who has kidnapped Ritzia so that he can call forth the power of the Mana tree and plunge the world into Darkness.  It's a pretty basic story.  The good news is that the story is presented really well.  The voice acting is top notch and the cutscenes are absolutely gorgeous to look at.  Unfortunately that's about where the compliments to the game end.  The gameplay, for as simple as it is, is rather frustrating.Firstly, the game is fairly action/adventure oriented and has a dungeon crawl like feel to it.  Keldric has what's called a ""Vine Sword"" that he can use to take on his enemies.  He can use it to swing enemies into other enemies as well, but the real treat with this weapon is using his Panic attack which causes enemies to drop items.  This is really the only way to get items from enemies.  They don't just drop them normally.  Keldric is also not alone.  He's got an ally named Faye there to help him out and she's there to cast some supportive magic on him.  Unfortunately unlike other Mana games, Dawn of Mana has no multi-player.  It's all really simple stuff until you throw in the games other mechanics.The targeting system in and of itself is incredibly flawed.  When battling enemies you can lock on to them.  However, for some odd reason, the game always locks on to an enemy in the distance... never the obvious threat that's taking you on.  You can also lock on to other objects, but again, it's never the one you want or one that's close by.  And if there are multiple enemies or objects the game has to cycle through them, and again it becomes tedious to wait for the game to get to the enemy or object you want.  You're better off going at it on your own and not wasting any time with the flawed targeting system.Another major flaw to the design of the game is the level up system.  At the start it seems all fine and dandy to level up and get your abilities, but the moment you complete a chapter you lose it all!  That means after you've gone through Chapter 1, leveled up Keldric and Faye to take on enemies, gotten them some pretty useful abilities and the like, you'll lose it all once you begin Chapter 2 and have to get them all over again.  All your work will pretty much go to waste.  The game tries to compensate by giving you Emblems which have abilities on them.Getting Emblems is a task in and of itself.  As you go through the chapters the game will rank you.  An S ranking is the highest you can get.  If you get a good ranking you'll be rewarded with an Emblem.  There's an Emblem rewarded for each difficulty level as well.  Completing Chapter 1 on Normal and getting the best rank will yield you a different Emblem than if you were to complete Chapter 1 on Hard mode with the best rank.  Your rank is determined by things like how fast yo complete the chapter, how many enemies you killed etc.  Yet even the Emblem system has its own flaws.  You can only select to equip them before the chapter starts.  You cannot change up Emblems in the middle of a chapter.  Instead you'll have to complete it.  A little more freedom would've been nice.  Also, getting Emblems is just all out difficult.  It's almost not even worth it to try.As you go through the game, there's also a radar in the upper corner to help you out.  It doesn't really provide that much help, though.  There's a yellow box which represents your goal and then there are blue and red boxes for your enemies.  Blue just simply means that the enemy has an item.  Although, for some reason, you'll run into enemies on the map that are marked red on your radar that will drop items while some of the blue monsters give you nothing.  Chances are yo won't really need the radar, but one has to wonder how Square-Enix managed to screw up something as simple as a radar system.  Especially since they've done these sorts of things in plenty of other games flawlessly.  The radar isn't scaled properly anyway.  There are moments when it'll appear an enemy should be right next to you, and you discover they're actually a little ways away.  Again, it's not too big, but it's such a simple concept that the fact that it wasn't done right is rather questionable.The last major flaw in the gameplay department: The camera.  It's a pain to mess around with.  Especially when in battle and it swivels on you while you're taking on an enemy.  It's controlled via the right analog stick, which makes things a little easier, but it's the fact that you'll spend a lot of time fighting with it to readjust because it positioned itself behind an object so you can't see yourself, or because the angle just isn't good.  You'll spend quite some time fighting with the camera, and it's just annoying.  The fact that there's no button to fix the camera right behind you is also sad.To the game's credit, though, it looks and sounds really good.  If anything, we can say that.  Square-Enix is known for making some gorgeous games and despite Dawn of Mana's flawed gameplay it's true here.  The look and feel of the game is absolutely fantastic.  The voice acting is also pretty good.  But the best part of Dawn of Mana is its soundtrack.  The music in the game is nothing short of brilliant.  On a technical level, Dawn of Mana is fantastic.  But pretty graphics don't make a game fun, and that's also true of Dawn of Mana.Dawn of Mana isn't a horrible game, it's just a very flawed one.  The part of the game that matters most--gameplay--suffers from things that a game in this day and age shouldn't suffer from.  It's especially disappointing considering what's flawed in this game are aspects that Square-Enix knows how to do well and have demonstrated they know how to do them well time and time again.  It'll be hard for Mana fans to look past the flaws in this one.  Another Mana game takes a dive.Pros:+Good graphics+Good Soundtrack+Well done voice actingCons:-Horrible targeting system-Bad Camera-You start each new chapter at level 1, losing all the work you did in the last chapter-Getting Emblems is a pain, and you can't change them in the middle of a chapter, they can only be equipped at the beginning of one-The radar is virtually useless",2,Another Mana Game Takes a Dive,1179878400,"05 23, 2007"

I'll keep as many spoilers out of my review.StoryNiko Bellic an Eastern European comes to America looking for a better life and to leave his past behind. He lives with his cousin Roman. But we all know that everything isn't going to go smoothly. ""As they slip into debt and get dragged into the criminal underworld by a series of shysters, thieves and sociopaths, they discover that the reality is very different from the dream in a city the worships money and status, ans is heaven for those who have them and a living nightmare for those who don't."" (From the back of the game)MapFor those who don't know this is a free-roaming game, meaning there is a huge map and you're free to explore! Go anywhere you want, do thing, find things, etc. Majority of the map is urban, there is the main city and there are the suburbs. There are a few forest like areas though. The city's name is Liberty City it is modeled after New York City.VehiclesLike the title of game refers to, you can steal cars and drive them. Trucks, sport-cars, bikes, just hot-wire them and take off! There are a wide range of ground vehicles to choose from. There are cars which are modeled after the Ferrari 458 Italia and Bentley, the only difference is they don't actually have the Ferrari or Bentley logos and a few tails are different. You can go to a car wash and the Pay ""n"" Spray which sprays your car with a random color. It's always random there's no way of choosing, it gets very annoying. There are only 2 air vehicles, one is a civilian chopper and the other is a police chopper. There are many boats to. Yachting boats, fast inflatable boats, etc.There is also public transport in the way of trains which you can ride.Cars have a boat like physics to them, if I'm hitting a curb at high speed and I make it it'll start wobbling/rocking like a boat side to side. They're still fun to drive though. If you crash a car it'll get dented, this is something that really surprised me, it can get extremely damaged too, to the point where the engine stops working, if it was a head on collision, or one of the tires is jammed up if the hit was directed to one of the wheels. Doors and hoods can be ripped off!WeaponsWeapons include the AK-47, M16, baseball bats, sub-machine guns, knifes, grenades, RPG-7, pistols, and Molotov cocktails. You can activate cheat code and get the higher level guns early on, but be careful doing some cheats will block trophies from being earned.KillingKilling in this game is a bit disturbing. You can go around shooting civilians, cops, anything. If a civilian is just walking around you can kill them in cold blood. Definitely not a game for children. PARENTS, the rating is there for a reason. In games like Battlefield or Call of Duty your at least killing soldiers, but killing civilians? Really? There's also the blood factor..it gets bloody.ActivatesYou have a wide range of thing you can do. You can go to a bar and get drunk, go bowling, go play darts with a friend, play pool, go to restaurants. You also have internet in the game, you can go to car sites, buy ring tones for your phone.PhoneYou have a cell phone. You use it to set up meetings, ask friends if they want to go to a bar, etc. You launch multiplayer games from your phone, you can think of it as the ""main menu"" in-game.MultiplayerFor mulitplayer you can create your own male or female character and customize a few things like clothes and skin color. You have many game modes to choose from like Deathmatch, Car Jack City, Cops 'n' Crooks, Free Mode, and many others. This game was released in 2008 but many people still play it.GraphicsGraphics are very good I would give them a 8.5 out of 10. They look quite natural. You can destroy garbage cans with explosions or by ramming them with a car, fences can be destroyed to, little things can be destroyed, but buildings or bridges cannot be.DialogueA lot of humor. There is swearing in the game.OverallIt's a good free-roaming game but it gets boring. After the main storyline you can do side missions and jobs for friends like being a taxi driver but doing all this gets old, it feels more like doing a choir then actually having fun. And don't forget about the killing of civilians, very, very violent. I wouldn't highly recommend this game as I've said about ten times now, it gets old and boring. Rent it first and then if you like it buy it. Multiplayer doesn't appeal to me much either, I guess I'm just not a GTA guy.

It no longer has that lousy delayed steering handling, your no longer forced to change the color of your vehicle every time you repair, the track design is a lot better, the environments are a lot more varied, the track length is much much longer, and the multiplayer is much improved.The graphics are pretty good but it is locked at a 30 fps.  If you play the game without trying out the framerate unlock fix, then its not going to matter if its locked at 30 fps since you will get used to the default framerate.  The graphics can range from really good to jaw dropping, depending on the environment and weather conditions.  The lightning flashes reflecting off of the puddles of water when its raining, is missing from NFS Hot Pursuit 2010 but it still looks good in Rivals.  The don't expect much out of the customization and also don't expect your vehicle to look dramatically different when upgrading it.One big flaw is the persistent online multiplayer with no single player because sometimes you want to go straight to a hideout to bank your cash points but you will engage into an unwanted pursuit because you can lose your cash points if you get busted or wreck your vehicle.Overall its a great, must-buy game for NFS fans, especially fans of the last 2 NFS games (Most Wanted and Hot Pursuit).

I can't speak for the other versions, but this one is lame. The graphics are subpar, the camera angle is often annoying, the main soundtrack consists of a single, short, endlessly looping track, and the game itself it quite short. I'm not very good at action games, and this game only took me several hours to finish completely. The game is an action/fighting game, and basically consists of advancing through long halls, with no branching paths or room to explore, defeating enemies. It's boring.

8611,96046,A287P9ABNCGIJY,B000XJLQ24,Mcdo,"[1, 1]","Awesome GameThis game is phenomenal. Very Heavy Metal oriented and it works very well. You can tell a lot of efforts went into making this game. The graphics are excellent and it is a real joy to ride in your car (The Deuce) while listening to a wide selection of heavy metal songs (100+ songs).As other reviewers have mentionned, i think the only bad thing about this game is the lenght. It is a short game if you just complete the main mission. It can be done in about 6 to 8 hours. But, if you take the time to complete the side missions as well as findings all the unlockables, the game will obviously last you longer. I prefer taking my time and enjoy every bit that this game has to offer.The side missions are a bit repetitive, but i find them entertaining. For me, i don't really care doing the race mission a few time or the ambush mission more than once. They are fun missions which change the pace of the game in my opinion. My favorite one is the hunter missions where you have to kill so many of a type of animals. Always fun to run over them with the Deuce.One thing that i find really strange is the fact that Eddie can not jump. Sure, you can hold X and charge your axe weapon up which will make Eddie jump and strike with his axe. But, if you just want to jump, you are out of luck. I did not find this to be a real problem. Just annoying at times when you are block by a branch or a small rock and you have to go around it instead of just jumping over it.The controls work well. It is very easy to pull some combos with your axe and guitar. The Deuce is also easy to drive even if at times, speed can play some tricks on you. You may run into obstacles if you go too fast with the Deuce. But, the car is very strong. You may see some smoke, but i have yet to break the car to the point it is destroyed.For the unlockables, there are a lot. There's Serpents statues you need to free, legends statues you need to find, special jumps you need to make with the Deuce, Metal Forges you need to raise, Songs you need to unlock. In short, there are a lot of unlockables to keep you busy for a long while. Some are really well hidden and hard to find. I have not found them all yet and i will not cheat. I want the game to last longer. On top of that, you have a lot of upgrades you can purchase with fire tributes which is the game's currency. You can upgrade your Deuce, axe, guitar and much more at one of the Metal Forge where you are greated by none other than Ozzy Osbourne as the Gardien of Metal. Nice touch.The RPG mode is not as bad as other reviewers have mentionned. It is different, but in a good way. The option to jump in the action and swing your axe or pull your strings is a nice touch. Some have said it ruined the experience. I think you either like it or you don't. I believe it was a different approach for a different game and it is done well. Works for me. Would not be the same Brutal Legend if the two modes of battles were not in.In conclusion, I have had and still have a lot of fun with this game. Even if i just jump in the Deuce to drive around and listen to music while running over wild animals. I also love using the Face Melter with the guitar and see those poor guys faces melt.....mouaahahahahahhahere's my review for this game:PROS:- Awesome graphics with HEAVY METAL theme- Very entertaining story- Driving the Deuce around- Great selection of many heavy metal songs- Lots of unlockables- James Black as Eddie- Ozzy as the Metal gardienCONS:- Game can be considered too short- Eddie can not jump- Side missions can be repetitive- Deuce can be hard to control when speeding",5,A heavy metal game legend,1312243200,"08 2, 2011"

4051,196559,A14PM5VOHPXF7Q,B006OI3CTS,A. Siddiqui,"[1, 3]","It's been ten years since the Keyblade warrior Sora first took arms into the battle between light, dark, and nothingness. When Kingdom Hearts was first released in 2002 on the Playstation 2 players were able to travel through iconic Disney worlds and encounter the popular characters from not only Disney franchises but Final Fantasy series as well. Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance marks the return of Sora and Riku as they attempt to become Keyblade masters. Although the story is difficult to follow and some plot points remain unanswered Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance is an excellent action-adventure title that utilizes the comedic dialogue, fast pace action, and memorable characters that has made this series so popular.Kingdom Hearts 3D takes place after the events of Kingdom Hearts: Recoded and follows the franchises most significant characters, Sora and his best friend Riku, as they attempt to pass the Mark of Mastery exam. You will take control of both characters and switch between the two in time intervals called drops. Both Sora and Riku must save parallel versions of seven different worlds in only to become true Keyblade Masters in order to defeat Xehanort. Kingdom Hearts 3D remains loyal to the concepts that made this franchise great such as notorious Disney worlds to explore, appearances by Final Fantasy characters, and a strong focus on light and darkness. If you played other games on the franchise you'll be able to put up the story quickly, however if you are new then you will have to read a lot of text and probably look up information pertaining to the various flashbacks. However as a person who has played Kingdom Hearts I still found the story difficult to follow due to pacing issues that was probably used to catapult the story forward into Kingdom Hearts 3.Unfortunately the exam doesn't go as plan and another villain seeks to control the light in Kingdom Hearts. Throughout your journey you'll experience flashbacks, visions of the future, and memorable characters. Each stage you venture into has been tailored from Disney films, such as classic movies like Fantasia and modern ones like Tron: Legacy. Within each stage you will solve problems from the movie's plot while getting one step closer to your own goal. As wonderfully animated as these stages are they offer limited exploration and most of the time you will follow a linear path. Don't expect a lot of side quests, but a card game can be played at certain places. Experiencing each nostalgic event is complemented with fantastic music that suits the environment and the battles that ensue.Each world is populated with a diverse amount of enemies known as dream eaters. These creatures appear randomly throughout each environment and have unique abilities. Although you only control Riku or Sora you can tame dream eaters to fight alongside you by collecting fragments hidden in treasure chest, loot from fallen enemies, or purchasing them from shops. You can create these creatures by either using recipes or just randomly putting things together.  To upgrade these creatures you earn points in battle and each dream eater comes with its own special attack that adds novelty to collecting them. Another option allows the player to personally manage your creature by providing actions of affection by using the touch pad causing different rewards and a lovely animation as they leap with joy.Although your dream eaters are valuable companions Sora and Riku will do most of the fighting. Returning is the command deck system from Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep. Players will be able to collect and equip abilities and magical talents for quick access. Sora and Riku will have access to offensive magical attacks, healing spells, special attacks, and other appealing abilities that are gained through battle. After using these specific powers a cool down period is initiated, forcing players to rely on careful planning before battles instead of spamming the same move.A new ability known as flow motion allows Sora and Riku to quickly navigate the environment. To activate this luminous ability you simply interact with the environment or enemies, allowing with quick movements such as grinding on rails, hopping on walls, swinging on poles, and spinning enemies around. Not only is these great for evading enemy attacks but within this state a specific set of attacks become available, even better is that these attacks or flow motion itself doesn't have a cool down period. Players will easily get addicted to pulling off the visually and destructive appeal of these abilities. However at time these mechanics is unresponsive on certain objects.Another new system known as the drop system forces you to switch between Sora and Riku. After a certain amount of time as passed players will be forced into the drop system to play as Sora or Riku and continue their overlapping story. This system can get vexing as players are forced to stop one objective for another, but you can extend the period before another drop by using Drop-Me-Not. Some may find these vexing but it forces players to play both stories without ignoring one over another.While you will be fighting and talking for most of your venture, minigames are introduced to break up the pace. Visiting a new world for the first time you are put into a dive that allows you to collect stars and defeat enemies similar to an on-rail shooter. Fans of Tron will enjoy the light cycle battles, hacking computers with the touch pad, and unscramble words. The 3D itself may not be the best on the system but it does allow for excellent depth-of-field within battles, minigames, and cutscenes.Kingdom Hearts 3D is a wonderful addition to the franchise. Despite its problems the combat, characters, and music remain the same stellar quality that is expected. It's unfortunate that the story doesn't share the same quality as the characters themselves, but humor and charm overshadow these difficulties for the most part. Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance is a befitting return of Sora and Riku.",3,Ten years later and still strong,1363996800,"03 23, 2013"

That was it. The game relied on mystery, environment, it's slow-paced, high tension, moody atmosphere. You had to save ammunition (the knife is your friend) not just for stronger enemies, not just in case of a horde of zombies, but because you don't know when you will REALLY need that ammunition; in fact, you were scared to use it. Hence, the genre Survival Horror was born (some people consider Alone in the Dark the first, which may be true, but Resident Evil was the first huge success). Resident Evil 1-4 relied on this Survival Horror system. Actually, it was more or less an attitude.Yes, I did include Resident Evil 4 as a Survival Horror game because at the beginning you have a basic handgun and a janky shotgun--which belonged to a farmer, most likely--against these people that are not acting entirely normal (yet they're not zombies, which was SO refreshing--at the time) and a gigantic ogre like boss. In Resident Evil 4 there is a real sense of John Carpenter's The Thing-esque paranoia about the odd acting residence (which is essentially very true to the title ""Resident Evil"" in the sense that you're going against these residents that are, indeed, evil; and the Japanese title still concurs with the game, too). The deeper you go in Resident Evil 4, the less scary it becomes, but that's because you've figured out the mystery and now you're trying to solve the problem. But, the first half of the game is pure horror (the first time you go into the village is probably the scariest the franchise has ever been before and after)--and then even toward the end of the game, there are still some moments of horror that will get you.Then there was Resident Evil 5: it was about a guy who killed a bunch of angry people infected with parasites and Star Wars' misfit monsters and Agent Smith from The Matrix made an appearance, but he dyed his hair blonde. Okay, I'm joking as you know, but that doesn't mean it isn't the truth. It was a decent action game (and Mercenaries was really fun with a partner) but not a very good Resident Evil game. This was always my comparison: If Resident Evil 4 was the Casino Royale of the Resident Evil franchise (a reboot which saved a dying franchise and breathed new life into it), then Resident Evil 5 was the Quantum of Solace of the Resident Evil franchise (gimmick after gimmick and an exploitation of the previous title's changes: what that means is that Resident Evil 5 said to itself, ""Resident Evil 4 changed a lot of things, so I'm going to change even more things."" A decent action game, but a horrible Resident Evil game from almost every aspect except for its dazzling graphics.RESIDENT EVIL 6:I thought that Resident Evil 5 was the Quantum of Solace of the franchise . . . but I was wrong.The game starts off without explanation: Leon and an injured girl (Helena) are in a ravaged city--zombies are everywhere and a helicopter is seemingly shooting at you. You make your way through the city only for you to realize that it was just a very interactive title and credits sequence. At the end of the gameplay you see a monster's foot and Leon says something smart like usual and then we see the title--Resident Evil 6--and now you're in the menu where you can choose your campaign or its multitude of special features.You can initially choose from Leon's campaign, Chris's campaign, or Jake's campaign, but choose wisely because once you pick one you have to see it through to the end. But, before getting into the campaigns, I'll discuss my general thoughts about the game.The general critiques about RE6 have been quite consistent. Imagine that you have a person with ADHD that loves action movies--but is trying to throw in horror to appeal to the fan base--and is trying to put together a very elaborate plot without the necessary skill for storytelling to tell it. The game is very unfocused; you're not sure who's the main* villain--in fact, not even the villains know who the true villains are. And when you beat the campaigns, only the least important details are explained--and even worse--in mundane manners.THE C-VIRUS (some spoilers in third paragraph): 1/5From the very start of the franchise what interested me more than the mutants or the zombies or the ganados/majini, was the virus or the parasite used to create such monstrosities. Resident Evil was about the T-Virus (Tyrant Virus) and, if you take Lisa Trevor into consideration, the origins of the G-Virus as well. Resident Evil 2 was about the effects the T-Virus and the G-Virus (which resulted in a form of unstable biological immortality at the cost of the human soul or consciousness); Resident Evil 3--which takes place at the same time as Resident Evil 2--continued to lay down the foundation of the T-Virus, but as opposed to showing the G-Virus (which only Leon was going against), the game focused on to what extent the T-Virus could be used for biological weaponry. For instance, the Nemesis-T Type was designed by a European branch of Umbrella to prove that T-Virus test subjects could still retain most of their intelligence. And to test out this hypothesis: Go kill all the S.T.A.R.S. members in Raccoon City so we could kill two birds with one stone. Resident Evil: Code Veronica was about the T-Veronica virus (which is a little harder to explain, but it's important to know that it's a variation of the Progenitor Virus which is the basis for all the previously mentioned viruses). I'm going to skip explaining the biological agents in Resident Evil Zero because it's essentially the same as in the first game, and finally go into Resident Evil 4, which was a game changer. The T-Virus was mentioned; Luis said that he had scene a sample at some medical center: that means that the T-Virus has been ultimately erradicated from the world; domesticated, you could say. Resident Evil 4, however, brought in a new type of biological weapon--the Las Plagas. Although many of the Las Plagas experiments in RE4 were accidental and experimental--such as the big salamander in the lake; it was just a byproduct of the experimentations taking place. And then Jack Krauser (who has a previously unknown history with Leon, but was later explained in Resident Evil: Darkside Chronicles), who was previously working for Wesker, pretending to work for Saddler, actually did take a gift from Saddler--the Plagas, which he injected into himself--and became more powerful (although I think the arm injure he had obtained against Javier in Darkside was a motivating factor). At one point, he mutated his arm. The point being, all the mutations in Resident Evil 4 made sense. And then we go into Resident Evil 5: the Uroboros makes perfect sense in a biological standpoint, because such a virus would need biological matter to grow in size; but it was the Las Plagas that didn't make sense. Ricardo Irving, for instance, injected himself and became a giant sea monster . . . oh, and he just happened to be on a boat . . . how convenient.Now, in Resident Evil 6, we have the C-Virus. Unlike in Resident Evil 1-5, I have no idea what the origins are, I have no idea how its biology works (other than it is a conductor of heat in many ways); I have no idea, partially because there are no in-game documentation about this virus or the B.O.W.'s designed from it. That's frustrating, because I don't know about you guys, but in previous games I made sure I collected every single document and I read them. At the time I didn't even like reading books (now I do, but that's not the point), but I still enjoyed furthering my experience. Is it realistic that there will be documents lying around? Probably not, but it's more realistic that some of the insane, ridiculous action sequences in this game which makes the motorcycle majini in Resident Evil 5 look like Christopher Nolan realism. Does CAPCOM think we are illiterate and can't read or don't want to read? Or, are they* the ones becoming illiterate (by the way, the game does have documents, but they can only be accessed through Special Features; I read some of the documents on the B.O.W.'s and they're not really explained intelligently, and the explanation for some of them, like the Chainsaw mutatant, was downright laughable--appearing that a thirteen year old fanboy wrote it without a sense of what they were righting would be perceived as humorous)?The C-Virus, oh the C-Virus. The C-Virus makes zombies; the C-Virus causes zombies to become obese, causes zombies to grow strange screaming organs in their throats, causes some zombies to become Liker-wanna-bes, and causes some zombies to still wield weapons--guns and bats and golfing clubs--and to still turn cranks occasionally to hinder your process (come on!); the C-Virus causes zombie dogs--which are identical to the T-variation (but what about cats? what about deer? what about raccoons? what about birds? what about animals that escaped from the zoo?); the C-Virus creates gigantic shark mutants, mutants that are three times as large as 4's El Gigante, mutants that somehow--through a C-Virus mutation--grow a chainsaw for a hand which has its heart inside of it (I don't think Neo-Umbrella designed this one through any scientific proceedure; I honestly think it just created itself by a naturalistic evolution of the C-Virus), mutants that are ripoffs of the Iron Maiden Regenerators from Resident Evil 4, or a snake that can turn invisible; the C-Virus causes hosts who inject themselves directly to still keep their intelligence, but to grow a lot stronger and to become mutated--they're called J'avo; the C-Virus causes a J'avo to mutate into a dozen different things, ranging from Bee-headed men that can send bees at you, spider-bodied men, the growth of wings, the growth of two long legs for super jumping, the growth of explosive larvi for their entire body, and more; the C-Virus causes some J'avo to caccoon themselves and then spore new horrors--lizard things (or, you can just say its the dinosaur that killed the fat guy from Jurassic Park), bunky bohemoths with rocks for skin, flying creatures, or a swarm of insects; the C-Virus is responsible for the coolest B.O.W. since Nemesis, Ustanak, the bio-mechanic super freak . . .But how? The game never gets into the scientific aspects of the virus. That's something that I always loved about the franchise until Resident Evil 5. Now, granted, a lot of these mutations are very cool--but hardly any of them make sense. Unless of course they went through the effort of trying to make them make sense. Why couldn't one of their campaigns have been about figuring out how ONE virus could do all these things? Another big problem is this: the C-Virus is TOO GOOD. It'll put the T-Virus, G-Virus, T-Verinica, Las Plagas, and the Uroboros out of a job. Especially since Ustanak is one of the hardest B.O.W.'s in the series. You see the problem here, don't you?They're trying to please the fans in unintelligable ways. I'm sorry CAPCOM, I'm not that stupid. And I know there are a lot of other fans who feel the same way.GAMEPLAY: 2/5Those of us who were good at RE4 were probably good at RE5; both games essentially had the same gameplay mechanics, aside from RE5's clunky inventory system. Well, RE6 throws that out the window in almost every way. The gameplay is what wounds the entire game fatally. I don't mind about walking while shooting, but I do mind about the unfixed camera behind the character. It feels like I'm playing a videogame adaptation of a movie in some points of the game. The weird thing is, the creators probably thought they were helping out the player by having a fluid camera behind them at all times, but really it gives me a headache and it's hard to aim my character when I need to run somewhere. The old system had its flaws, but this new-and-supposed-to-be-improved system creates even more.Oh, and get this. You know how you could shoot enemies in the legs in RE4 and RE5 and they fall to their knees so you can do some interesting melee attacks? Well, in RE6 you can't shoot enemies to their knees--hence, creating less melee variety. I wonder which one of the creators said to the others, ""We should definitely get rid of shooting enemies in the legs."" It's a really strange decision they made that I don't understand the point of which.And quick time events. There are tons of them, but none of them are as good as the Leon vs. Jack Krauser scene from Resident Evil 4. A lot of people have complained about this, but I didn't mind. I was just never blown away, aside from the final Ustanak battle at the end of Jake's campaign. That was innovative, I must say.LEON AND HELENA: 4/5Have you ever read an over bloated novel that could have been a whole lot better if the author cut out at least 25% of it? Well, that's what Leon's campaign felt like. His campaign is deliberately designed for the Survival Horror Resident Evil fan--you know, the gamers that likely hate on RE4 and RE5 because they have no Survival Horror (or a lack of); ""zombies"" return only* in Leon's campaign, and it also features some really cool zombie-variations (although I couldn't help but compare most of them to Left 4 Dead's super zombies). Leon's campaign starts off in an intense situation without much explanation, then travels through a zombie infested Tall Oaks, goes to a church which happens to have an underground laboratory underneath (there is sort of* a reason for this), then goes to China (which he randomly and too conveniently reunites with an old acquaintance immediately after the rough landing of the plane, which will undoubtedly make the player giggle with how unlikely the by-chance meeting really is).Leon's campaign is the heart of Resident Evil 6. Leon knows Sherry, Leon knows Chris, Leon has a thing for Ada (who seemingly is/isn't the villain in the game), and by theory does the most important things in the game. The game's creator(s) deliberately did this because Resident Evil 4 was the most successful in the franchise.The highlight of Leon's campaign is the atmosphere; the flaw is its overly bloated length (this campaign feels as long as Resident Evil 5 as a whole, and yet there are still two other campaigns--technically three more--to go).CHRIS AND PIERS: 2/5The first thing that you will ask is: what the heck happened to Jill Valentine? And who the heck is Piers? The game never answers those two questions, but it only hints at the fact that Chris never gave up the fight against bioterrorism after he saved the world from the Uroboros. It's a little jarring when we first see Chris Redfield; he's lost his memory and he acts like a depressed Tony Stark drinking and smoking himself to death in a bar in some country. Piers was his old partner and he recruits Chris back into the force (why didn't they just have Jill Valentine instead? I really don't know). Piers is one of the least likeable characters in the franchise  just because of how bland he is and really has no purpose in the story or the history of the franchise. I would have at least liked some references to what happened to Jill Valentine, but I was left unsatisfied.To say the least--and without spoilers--Chris's story is structured oddly; but, moving on from that, there is only one strength to his campaign. And that's when he and his team go into a building to chase a snake B.O.W.. It did not contribute to the plot at all (which is good, because RE6 is soooooo plot heavy that it gives me a headache); nope, Chris is just in a frenzy to chase down this snake B.O.W. at all costs (and it's no doubt a shout out to the first Resident Evil game). It's actually when Chris is walking the ""screenwriters"" path to keep the plot moving when I care the least about what's happening.  The problem with Chris's campaign is that they--the creators of the game--forced his purpose in the game (I'd like to say more, but that would include spoilers) by giving him personal vendetta instead of just doing his job. A BSAA operative's purpose is to kill B.O.W.'s and to rescue civilians--it would have been a lot simpler if that's what Chris's purpose in the game was, instead of being so plot driven.Ultimately Chris's campaign is a narrative mess. They tried way too hard with his personality, his past (by ignoring a lot of it), his purpose, etc.. Instead of just letting him do what he does best . . . kill B.O.W.'s and then--and ONLY then--discover what's going on in the grand scheme of things. The ONLY redemptive quality about his campaign was hunting the snake: that felt like survival horror. Although, on that note, I wish that Chris could have been able to save more of his team. There's no reward in inevitable cutscenes killing off the team. In that sense, CAPCOM is the monster, not the snake. In this Skyrim day and age, players need to be rewarded or punished for in game choices.JAKE AND SHERRY: 3/5Let me say this right off the bat. Only one element to this campaign makes it worthy of playing: the Nemesis-esque bio-mechanical B.O.W. which was designed and programmed for one thing and one thing only: to capture Jake Muller. Why? Well, if it hadn't been for most of the trailers of the game, then it would be a spoiler, but since everyone knows, it isn't a spoiler anymore. Jake Muller is Wesker's son. That's why he's important. Sherry Birkin magically finds him in a European country (she wasn't--but somehow was--trying to find him from the beginning. It's hard to explain. It goes back to a similar awkward narrative that the Chris campaign had). And she knows that he has rare antibodies that can save the world. Talk about taking it slow and letting the player discover the mystery on their own, which is a huge problem the game has in general . . . it treats the audience like everyone is a Michael Bay fan and doesn't care about story and characters, but only the spectacle and thrilling events. I think the usually-good-reviews that RE5 had sort of enforced this ideology that not-everything-has-to-make-sense-because-the-fanbase-doesn't-care-too-much-about-logic (why CAPCOM? Are you saying I'm stupid or just complacent with the mundane?)-just-give-them-zombies-and-they'll-be-satisfied. Honestly, I wish the creators took care in their story as if I was watching a Christopher Nolan film instead of a Michael Bay film. I think the Resident Evil fan base is too smart for some of the very illogical ""moments""/plot elements in RE6; a lot of which are in Jake's and Sherry's campaign.What I found most annoying about this campaign is that I thought it would answer the most questions, such as what ""Ada Wong"" is up to, and Jake's origins and what about the crazy awesome Ustanak B.O.W.? As cool as these questions are, none of them are really answered at all. They're half-baked ideas that never really formed.When I played the Leon campaign, I thought that Chris's and Jake's campaigns would make sense out of a lot of random B.O.W.'s and plot events; when I played the Chris campaign, nothing was answered, so I was thrilled that the Jake campaign would answer everything. Nope. Not at all. His blood is important and that's all that you* need to know.CONCLUSION:There are moments in the game that are better than any moments from any of the other games. In fact, if they had trimmed anywhere from 25% to 50% of the game, then maybe this game would be just as good--if not better--than Resident Evil 4. But the problem is this: think of RE6 as a buffet, but you can't choose what you eat; you have to eat in a random--but set--order. If green beans are first, you gotta eat them. Then cheesecake could be next (AWESOME), and then . . . you gotta eat piss and snot soup (EEWWW), and then some tasty Chinese food, and then fried poop. You see, it's the highs and lows of the game which makes it so disappointing. I could have forgiven the clunky controls and awkward inventory if they cut out all the mundane aspects of the campaigns, making them more to the point, even if each campaign was cut in half. Then it would have been an amazing game.But it's all the crap (no pun intended) that you're force to eat which makes it so frustrating at times; for instance, in the Leon campaign, there's a part where you have to chase a zombie dog around a graveyard (spooky, right? You're in a graveyard, so it HAS to be spooky--and there's lightning, too) because it has the key . . . and somehow it's smart enough to know that you need it and it runs away and doesn't attack you. And it's all the illogical inclusions of B.O.W.'s (that are cool, mind you, but without purpose) which makes me feel like I'm watching a Paul W.S. Anderson adaptation. Then there are all the pacing issues too. It's such a fast paced game that you can't stop and smell the flowers and enjoy--and be disturbed by--the horrific terrain and scary atmosphere. CAPCOM tried to do way too much. They cannot make this the scariest game in the franchise and a high octane thrill ride at the same time. They need to get off the fence and decide what they want to do. And I hope it's the former, and not the latter for the next game.WAYS TO SAVE THE DYING FRANCHISE:In the beginning of my review, I referenced 28 Days Later. The reason is, CAPCOM is trying to cure the franchise without truly understanding. Yes, they listened to some complaints, but ignored others. Yes, Ustanak is an amazing B.O.W.; yes, Chris isn't so bulky anymore; yes, zombies have returned (sort of); yes, they tried. But they weren't very smart in the sense that they don't understand their own franchise and they exploited beloved characters to the point of ridiculousness. Must they deliberately hire a few fans to be the creative directors in the next game? Does it need to come down to that? At this rate . . . absolutely. If they want RE7 to survive. Otherwise, there's no hope left.Resident Evil is not Uncharted, it's not Gears of War, it's not Call of Duty, it's not a racecar game, it's not an on-rails shooter. Resident Evil, from 1-4, has always been about exploration and horror, stumbling onto a mystery and trying to solve it, and survival. While Resident Evil 5 was not a Survival Horror game, it did attempt to stay true to Resident Evil 4. It didn't take enough risks, mind you, but it didn't step backwards either (the only* gripe I have with RE5 is some of the story decisions and how Wesker could teleport).Resident Evil 7 needs to take a step back. No they need to take a couple hundred meters back and objectively and subjectively look at the franchise. What works? What doesn't work? Horror works. Too much action doesn't. RE6 had so much environmental action to the point of predictability--such as walking across a bridge, you knew it would fall--but the thing about predictability is that it isn't scary. Actually with the environment going haywire while playing the game, it could be looked upon as a Final Destination videogame adaptation too (really). RE6 failed to understand that having awesomely grotesque monsters doesn't make it a scary game (such as being in a graveyard while there's lightning). Pacing is what makes games scary. Why were the first few games so scary? Not because of what happened, but because of what didn't* happen. In RE6 too much happened.Resident Evil 7 needs to be shorter (gasp!) and to the point. There needs to be a clear cut villain or two or three (like in RE4), and a sense of exploration and difficulty. If Resident Evil 7 took some RPG elements and throw in Dark Souls-esque difficulty and strategy, it could be the greatest game of all time; but--and this is probably scary for CAPCOM--they need another reboot. They must if they want to survive, because for RE7, I'm going to be smart enough to read the reviews first, and if it's not a good game--and if it's not a horror game--I'm not going to buy it. And I consider myself a diehard fan. I've beaten Resident Evil 4 20+ times and can't think of any flaws; I played Resident Evil 5 twice before realizing it was a little bit of a disappointment; I played only the Leon S. Kennedy campaign to realize that Resident Evil 6 was simply not a great game. RE6 felt like it was essentially an on-rails game: there's no straying from the path and no sense of exploring the area. Why not have a few houses available to go through to see if there is anything of use?And for the love of God, bring back the merchant. I hate ""buying"" things on a screen. It might not make a whole lot of sense how he can transport as quickly as you can, but at least the buying/selling process makes sense with the merchant. Also they could give him a backstory too, because clearly he isn't entirely human. And if your character learns skills, then why not have random BSAA operatives around the city which know skills that you can learn from? Maybe Erickson with a broken leg and hiding on a roof can teach you a move or give you a gun if you find him crutches in the city (but without any cookie crumb trail system to lead you the way; let the players find it themselves), and the possibilities could go on forever. Kind of like in Skyrim. And speaking of which, it needs to have a lot more RPG elements.All in all, CAPCOM needs to slow it down for Resident Evil 7. Resident Evil fans (unless they're fans of the films, too) generally are patient people: that's why they're Resident Evil fans. In the first five or six games, there was a lot of walking around, not knowing what to do exactly; there were a lot of puzzles and a lot of backtracking. So why are the creators treating us like we have ADHD and no attention span and no intelligence at all? Seriously, Resident Evil fans don't need (and generally don't want) non-stop action; we don't need the cookie crumb trail system to tell us where to go (we like finding our own way); we like to play a Resident Evil game and have a sense of accomplishment afterward, like the effect that Dark Souls has--with difficulty comes rewarding accomplishment. Come on CAPCOM. Know who your fans are. Don't assume that we're all Paul W.S. Anderson fans. Some of us expected a Christopher Nolan-esque tale, not another Schumaker game where the characters have rubber nipples on their suits. The creator of the series mentioned recently that the fans and the creators have like two parents trying to do what's best for their kid, and that they're going to disagree with one another. Come on, CAPCOM! That's a very unfair thing to say, because we're the ones who made you successful, and we are--for the most part--flat out telling you guys that you're going too far. If the fans and the creators are like two parents that disagree with one another, then CAPCOM is trying to make our broad shouldered son into a dancer instead of a football player, which is what he does best. Resident Evil is not meant to be as ridiculous as its Paul W.S. Anderson film counterparts, end of story.IN A NUTSHELL:Pros:1) Great dialogue2) Terrifying creature designs3) Enemy variety4) Atmosphere5) Really great moments6) The partner system is fixed (although I'd prefer without one)7) Imaginative boss battles8) Fantastic cutscenes9) UstanakCons:1) Inventory (a step down from RE5)2) Melee is too convenient, and thus not rewarding3) Controls are clunky, camera fluidity is irksome4) Mundane tasks (chasing a zombie dog around a cemetary)5) Forced plot (they meet up in the darnest spots)6) No in-game documents (which would help make sense out of some random B.O.W.'s)7) No typewriters (but it's such an on-rails game, why would it matter?)8) No treasures (which makes buying skills VERY difficult)9) No point in exploration (BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TREASURES OR DOCUMENTS!)10) No merchant (come on, CAPCOM, bring the man back)11) The C-Virus (the T-Virus has children to feed; you're putting it out of a job)12) Too long (with too many mundane moments in all the chapters to even revisit)- On that note, the campaigns are so long that it would be a task to replay any of the campaigns.13) Not scary (although it had its moments)14) Confusing plot elements15) Too much action (seriously, this is Michael Bay's Resident Evil; I'd prefer Christopher Nolan's or Frank Darabont's)16) Vague B.O.W. origins (a chainsaw arm, really?)",3,"If you were expecting a Christopher Nolan-esque ""sequel,"" they give you Schumacher's Resident Evil instead: Bat nipples included",1349481600,"10 6, 2012"
8521,167040,ADPEAVHFCNLLC,B0044SA70M,Poisoned Blade,"[1, 1]","Although this isn't how I like my women, Big and Good is what you want for an action RPG!Story: 9/10The world was developed by famed fantasy writer R.A. Salvatore, the creator of Drizzt!  The world is incredibly deep and full of rich lore, loosely based on Celtic mythology and folklore.  In the world of Amalur, everyone is a slave to their fate.  Whether you were predestined to die a peasant or save the world, there's no escaping your destiny... Until your character rises from the dead, and became fateless.  Could this lead into a golden age of freedom or are you a pawn in a much larger, darker, game?Graphics: 7/10The graphics are similar to World of Warcraft.  There is lots of style in the world and architecture, so it feels cohesive.  The colors are saturated and the shapes are somewhat cartoonish.  I really dislike the cartoony look of the game because it breaks immersion.  If you like the WoW look, then you'll enjoy this game's visuals.  There are barren wastelands, lush forests, castles, towns, dungeons, and ancient ruins.Gameplay: 9/10This is an Action RPG with the emphasis on Action.  Basically, the game works like this:  Find a town, get some quests, mark them as active, track them down on your map, and complete them for Gold and XP.  This isn't a completely open ended world.  Instead, there are large areas and dungeons separated by relatively short loading screens.  There are Main Quests, which advance the story, Faction Quests which are side story based quests and deal with the fate of a group, and random quests that you find just about everywhere.  You get a quest journal where the quests are separated by type and text explaining what you need to do.  It's incredibly clear and they're easy to find on the main map.You also get lots of freedom in this game.  Defeat enemies with combat, magic, stealth, persuasion...  There really is only one way through the game, but you are free to steal, assault, and murder NPC's.  If you do, the guards show up and demand payment.  If you do not pay, they throw you in prison where you can wait out your sentence or try to escape.  Once you pay or get out of jail, your record is cleared and you are not wanted for any crimes.  This isn't the type of game where your reputation follows you.  Being fateless has its advantages.Combat: 9/10You have 70 inventory slots to start with, and you can buy more at stores.  You can equip two weapons at a time, and 4 Special Abilities.  The X button uses 1 weapon and the Y button uses the other.  There are special moves by holding down buttons or pausing in between the moves of the combos.  So, X, X, X, X is one combo where X, Pause, X, X, would be another.  The weapons and abilities that you choose are up to you.The Abilities are mapped to the face buttons: A, B, X, Y.  You bring up your Abilities List by holding LT, and pressing the appropriate button.  Some abilities are quick acting, like Lightning Bolt, some are constant but drain a percentage of your total mana like Shield, and some provide special gameplay like 'Backstab unwary enemy for a ton of damage.'Defensively, you can dodge with a diving roll, block a % of damage with a shield, or parry with your shield at the right time to knock an enemy off balance, allowing you an opening for a combo.  The Shield magically appears in your hand when you press the Block button so you can dual wield AND use a shield, which is nice.You usually fight 1 to 7 enemies in the game.  There are melee guys that charge you and ranged enemies that launch arrows or spells from a distance.  There are humanoid rogues, mages, warriors, and a large assortment of beasts.Health and Mana potions are mapped to the D-Pad and you can instantly activate them without a sluggish ""Drink Potion"" animation that often gets you killed in lesser games.As far as RPG combat goes, this one has lots of depth.Level Up: 10/10This is the most open ended level up system that I've ever seen in a game.  Because your character can defy fate in the story, you are free to shuffle your Attributes and Abilities at any time.  If you're a Fighter with a warhammer and a greatsword, and you want to change things up, you can.  Just see a Fate Weaver, pay some gold, and Whamo!  You can reassign all of your Attribute Points any way you want.  Now you can be a Sorcerer, a Rogue, or a Mix of any of the three classes.  It's completely up to you.  The game keeps track of how many ability points you have in each Class's Skill Tree and generates class names with predefined bonuses.  So, if you are playing as a Rogue / Mage, you can unlock the Class Warlock and get damage bonuses to your magic and piercing weapons!Any time you Level Up, you also get a Skill Point that you can put on any crafting skill.  These are separate from your 3 Attribute Points you get when you Level Up.  Your Skills can be applied to crafting, persuasion, stealth, lockpicking, detect hidden, mercantile, or dispel magical wards.  All of these skills are beneficial, too.  If you load up on Detect Hidden, enemies, chests, hidden loot, shrines, etc... will show up on your mini-map.  If you load up on Mercantile Skills, you'll get better prices at stores and you can destroy excess items in your inventory for cash!  These Skill Points also get reset when you see a Fate Weaver, so you're free to try out all of the skills.I did try all of the skills and at first, I had lots of points on alchemy and blacksmithing.  This game has potions for boosting any stat you can think of.  You can also craft gems for socketed items to boost the power of the item or even craft your own weapons.  To craft weapons, you find parts like hilts, blades, wraps, rivets, armor...  Depending on your skill, you can combine 2-5 parts.  If you want to make a sword, you have a Hilt, a Blade, and up to 3 additional slots.  The additional slots are for extra effects and damage.  You can create a longsword that does 25 damage, 25 fire damage, regenerates 1 HP per second, and adds 45 to your Mana.  What you create depends on the parts that you find.  You can also salvage any gear you have for its parts.Unfortunately, after spending lots of time on alchemy and smithing, I realized that there really wasn't any need for them.  The loot drops and loot from chests were really good.  I ended up putting all of my points on Mercantilism and just bought great weapons and armor at great prices.Exploration: 8/10The world is huge and there are dungeons and quests everywhere.  Around every corner, there are ambushers, people who need help, dungeons, ruins, etc...  There's also hidden loot stashed in chests, locked chests, magically sealed chests, tree trunks, and rock piles all over the world.  Locked and sealed chests can be opened with a Lockpicking or dispelling mini-game.  Failing lockpicking just breaks your lock pick.  Failing a dispelling curses you with some sort of stat loss.  Curses can be removed by healers in towns.  To keep things moving, you can fast travel to any location where you've already been.  The Exploration in this game is streamlined and rewarding!Maturity: TeenThis is a  high fantasy adventure game.  There's some cartoony blood, fantasy violence, cartoony monsters, etc...  There's no sex, romance, or swearing.Replay Value: ???The game is about 25-50 hours long, depending on how many side quests you do, but since you can change classes and abilities any time you want, there really is no reason to start over and replay the game from the beginning.  After you finish the game, you're free to keep exploring the massive world and complete quests.  If you never played as a rogue and want to try it out just change classes and keep playing.  So, there really isn't ""replay value"" but there is a lot of value in the main quest.  If you do a decent amount of side quests, you will level up pretty high and the game will feel too easy.  At any point, you can change the difficulty level.It's strange.  The main story is only composed of 14 quests.  In a game where you have well over 100 quests and little replay value, it would have been much better if the main story was longer and was more difficult as you progressed through it.Overall: 8.5/10This is a very huge and flexible game with a good story and deep lore.  If you're a fan if high fantasy and like real combat in your RPG's, and don't mind the cartoony graphics, then you should enjoy this game.Buy it if you like long action RPG's.Buy it if you love high fantasy.Buy it if you like fairly easy games.Rent it if you have at least 20 hours to blow through the main quests.Avoid it if you hate WoW style graphics and prefer realism.If you liked this game, there are plenty of others in the action / RPG genre.

I do well at solving the ""difficult"" and ""fiendish"" puzzles in the New York Post Sudoku books (in my opinion are the best Sudoku books out there).  I thought I'd divert from these puzzles and try a shot at Platinum Sudoku after reading some of the reviews.So far I've spent about 3-4 hours playing and have only solved 10 puzzles.  The puzzles are frustrating and challenging.  The ""Easy"" mode is not that easy, and I've barely scratched the surface on ""Medium"" mode. The numbers in ""draft"" mode (for guessing numbers)is so small that you have to get out your reading glasses to see what you've marked.  Also, the default font is incredibly hard to read and to get used to.  Unless you unlock some new fonts by completing several puzzles, there's really not a good font to select.  That alone makes the puzzles difficult to complete.  One of the things I have to agree with many other reviewers is the stupid girl and guy that supposedly pumps you up and makes you feel like you've accomplished something after completing a puzzle.  Give me a break!  It would have been nice to have the option to turn this feature off, similar to the music option.The graphics are okay, but that's not what a good Sudoku puzzle is all about.All in all, this game will be on my ""used games to sell"" list.

You can play the game by yourself if you want, but the experience is definitely lacking. It's odd to play through a level with only Ratchet and an AI-controlled Clank and then in the ensuing cutscene see Qwark and Dr. Nefarious standing next to you as if they had been by your side the whole time. It's clear the game wasn't intended as merely a two or three player game: in order to get the ""full effect"", there should be four players. This is asking a bunch, for a couple of reasons: one, not everyone has three friends they can play with; and two, the many problems and glitches in Sony's online network make playing online impossible for some people. For example, I have a fast internet connection and all my devices work fine on it except my PS3, which for some odd reason gets extremely slow download speeds. It's so slow that there's no way I could play All For One online--the server would laugh in my face before I even got to the create-game screen.Multiplayer issues aside, All For One is disappointing also for its bare-bones approach. Whereas previous games in the series were filled out with a rich story and multiple cutscenes, All For One shakes things down to simply ""creating"" a game and getting into the multiplayer action.  The game's menu support system has also been drastically cut down. Forget about rereading all those help desk messages, move descriptions, item explanations, and the like. Nothing of the sort is offered in All For One.The game is simply about four people running around causing chaos and mayhem: that's it. Even the weapons are all just rehashses of previous weapons in the series. There's no sense of excitement when you obtain a new one, because you've had it before in previous games.There is also no real sense of challenge in the game. Even on Hard difficulty, the game is mind-numbingly easy. Die and you simply respawn right where you were.  Enemy design and variation are disappointing. Even the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense. In all the other Ratchet and Clank titles, there is at least one interesting female character that plays a major or semi-major role. In All for One, the feminine gender is conspicuously absent, except for the presence of a little girl named Susie who instantly wins your heart.The AI-controlled Clank for the single player game is one of the worst AIs I've ever seen in a game. He is just so completely stupid. He constantly falls off ledges or into environmental hazards, and during the mini-games in which you attempt to unlock pieces of the RYNO armor by way of teamwork, he sometimes will not do what is required of him.What it comes down to is that if you're looking for a great single player game, stick with Crack in Time or Tools of Destruction. All For One offers an entirely different experience, one that will be a disappointing one for many players.",2,"A Bare-Bones, Multiplayer Approach Leaves Single Players in the Cold",1341705600,"07 8, 2012"

Unfortunately I fed into the media blitz put on for this game.  Big mistake!The story is visceral and engaging but not for the faint of heart.  Much of the imagery is disturbing and gruesome.  What was there was pretty well done for an initial release, but there just wasn't much there.  I was just getting the feel for the game when the campaign/single player ended.  I was in shock as it was only my second session with the game, meaning I finished it in under 5 hours.At this point I moved on to the online campaign.  After selecting XBox Live I was prompted for to purchase or redeem an online code.  What?!  I just bought the game why would I need a code.  Its not a PC, its a console, this is odd.  But sure enough I found in my game case the required online access code.  Without this code you can only play up to level 5 in multiplayer.So with a 5 hour campaign and a required code to play online this game is going to be a real bummer for anyone who buys it used.  They will have to pay to be able to play it online.  If there are multiple people in your house with different Live accounts, they will each have to buy their own code.  This is the most absurd thing I have ever seen with a console game.  With all the compromises that I deal with for console gaming, the one thing I expect is a level of trust that I am not stealing the game, but apparently that is now gone too.A couple of other pet peeves with this game.  The game would have been even shorter if I had not had to sit and wait seemingly forever for the NPCs to open a door and walk through it, at times right after a checkpoint so that you get to enjoy it multiple times if you die.  That is even if you know exactly where to go and what to do, you have to wait for the NPC to open the door and saunter through it, and then the next NPC to follow before you can then walk through the door.  If you try to go earlier you just get in the way, are not allowed to proceed and slow the progress of the NPC, and ultimately your own progress.  Another annoyance was points of infinite spawns in the game where if you attempted to pre-clear an area you would never finish, had I just moved up at first try the game would have been even shorter and I would have had more ammo.  Finally, there is a sniper mission where you must wait for the NPC to identify the target, and finally give you the OK to fire.  If you shoot anytime before the final OK, you will have to restart the mission.  While this might be OK, it is not made clear until you drop the first target.",1,A big let down,1301270400,"03 28, 2011"
8945,108207,AS8C336DDLSO4,B001ABP95E,"Mr. Ben ""ctsamurai""","[5, 7]","I love music games, the progression from Guitar Hero 2 to 3 and then the Rock Band franchise have all been bigger and better than the last.  World Tour picks up where GH3 left off in many regards, now there is character creation, the ""full band"" setup, more downloadable content, etc.These changes are welcome, but after Rock Band 1 and 2, its almost required that you have those features just to keep up.  I didn't buy the new guitar, but I like some of the new features of the instrument, like the increased size, the quieter strum bar, and the main fret buttons which feel quick and responsive.  I don't really like the upper neck/touch pad part, when playing sequences like ""The Joker"" it seems like a ""cheat"" to just slide your finger around.  The fact that it actually makes it harder to play ""normally"" with your older Guitar Hero controllers (I'm still using the explorer from GH2!) is even more frustrating.I play on Hard difficulty and it seems like they've 'tightened' up the hammer-on/pull-off so that you have to be much more precise  (compared to GH3's ""button mashing"").  I think Rock Band's is precise enough, World Tour is almost evil in how precise you have to be some times.  Similar complaint for the Rock Out feature- you have to really move the guitar to get the overdrive/star power engaged- ideally you could change the sensitivity for your own preference.However, those changes are minor compared to the heart of the game: the music.  And in this regard, Guitar Hero World Tour comes up short.  Not because there aren't enough songs, but the songs available are boring.  Wings? Willy Nelson?  Beastie Boys? (Rock Band is guilty of having a Beastie's song too)  Lots of songs that repeat too much, or quite simply are dull.  I think the problem is that these are popular songs to listen to, but when you have to play ""The Joker"" its just not as cool as over-emphasizing the chorus as you sing along to the jukebox.  It seems like if its not catering to ""hardcore"" fans with songs like Tool, its catering to people in their 30s or 40s (sorry oldfolks.)  Unfortunately, Tool songs are in the neighborhood of 8 minutes (or in music game terms: an eternity)  I'm not saying Tool is boring, but having to play Tool on Guitar Hero IS boring.I don't think it helps matters that visually, Guitar Hero is an uglier game than Rock Band.  The characters look like monstrous marionettes with frightening shark-mouths when they sing.  Its like a bizarre mannequin dance party in hell.  I created a female character and felt like I was designing an alien dressed as a human.  If you plan on playing for an hour, you want something pleasing to look at- which World Tour fails at.  Additionally, the venue design is weak, and the ""encore"" animation in which ""something happens"" (like fireworks or ghosts or something else stupid) changes the venue slightly, like it makes any difference at all- just slows down getting through the game and getting onto the next (boring) song.The game is full of poor pacing, between the load times and dull songs, there's little to love about World Tour.  On top of it, Rock Band is heaping on downloadable content that has much of World Tour's track list covered (if you care for so many dull songs).  I was surprised that Guitar Hero took so many miscues all in one game.",3,Pales in comparison to Rock Band 2,1235347200,"02 23, 2009"

Games like Assassin's Creed had some very bad gameplay choices and incredibly repetitive structures but I still beat it mainly because one part of my brain thought ""it's tolerable"" but in the case of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, after a few hours in, I thought there was no way I'm going to be able to handle any more of this and there's still 100 hours or more apparently and I have to tell you, I just couldn't handle any more.Story: Instead of topics about existence and spiritual matters as seen in a lot of Japanese RPG's, Western RPG's tend to be about England in the Middle Ages with characters fighting demons and goblins from an evil realm, Emperors and heirs to thrones and the collecting of mystical artifacts. And that's Oblivion in a nutshell: the Emperor gives you a world-saving quest involving his previously-unknown heir and the realm of Oblivion and the dark forces that go on there. I think that's part of the reason why I couldn't really get into the story as it's too familiar and too close resembles other RPG's.Graphics: I mentioned this in another review but it definately applies to Oblivion as graphics can be divided in 2 categories: the aesthetic and the performance. Oblivion as far as its look is quite gorgeous and there's many picturesque locales and sceneries that look quite striking (although there's not much variety in them either). On the other hand, despite the 5 gig install which isn't Bioshock/Devil May Cry 4-like where it does it at the beginning and does it through the gameplay itself, it still has texture pop-in where trees just magically appear, framerate dips and even pauses within the game and glitches. One time I wanted to ride my horse but apparently I was in the wrong spot as my character just walked against his side, forcing me to jump away and reposition my character.Sound/Music: First I'll do the music as it's quite fantastic. Renaissance-esque music with flutes, violins, pianos and more triumphant themes show up and I just loved having the music on and listening to it which especially works well as your travelling the countryside. However, the voice acting is iffy as you'll literally run into people from different ends of the land with the same voice. One mission I had to save a village because its citizens were invisible. Going to a nearby fort and locating a man that gave me the item required to help out, imagine the confusion when the man who sent me on the quest in the first place had the same voice as the guy who gave me the item. Either they're part of a inaccessible cloning experiment or the voice actors didn't even have the common sense to change voices for new characters. At least Patrick Stewart and Sean Bean are here to make things better.Gameplay: Games like the Grand Theft Auto series or an RPG like Final Fantasy reward players for doing quests off the beaten path. In GTA, it's driving a certain number of taxi missions, police car, ambulances, fire trucks, locating hidden packages and the like. Final Fantasy ranges from card games to ultimate weapons or fetch quests. Oblivion is similar as the main love many have for this game is the large amount of stuff you can do. From levelling your character's stats and equipment to taking on various quests from people to item collecting, it's fair to say if you're a completionist well this game will keep you busy. I, however, like to finish the main quest with the occasional optional stuff (Gold Chocobos let's say) but I didn't even bother taking on most of them and wanted to finish the main quest, which is sad cause there wasn't really a driving motivational reason to beat the game other than saying I ""beat it"".The oft-maligned levelling system of Oblivion rightly gets it scorn as you don't progress by EXP to conquer your foes necessarily but rather repeatedly using one skill. Want to be a better swordsman? Cut down lots of enemies. A better sniper? Use your bow. Better your shield and armor? Get hit. Not only does this feel rather strange but it also makes it easier to work your way around the enemies who level up with you. Key is to better your stats so that a level 20 run-of-the-mill demon won't clobber you like your inexperienced level 1 self. I don't know about you but I prefer the traditional system of taking on multiple enemies so I can kick a level boss all over a room by the flick of my finger and not have the jerk bust my balls because I don't use my shield more often.At a certain point, you have to stop trying to force a game and just take it for what it is. Unlike other games I initially didn't care for, only to keep playing because something kept bringing me in, the more time I thought about playing Oblivion more, the more thoughts of tediousness and general lack of motivation I had for completing the game.

As you might expect, some people think it is great - and others find it very limited.Many modern games come with ""level creators"", so most people who are interested in game design have given a try at putting together a level or two. You lay out the rooms, add in textures, add in a few character models and then see how things go. You quickly learn just how much actual work is involved in designing a level that is enjoyable. It's not just about adding halls and doors. It's about designing a world that seems realistic, that is fun to explore, and that provides challenges.That all being said, the toolset that you use to create your world should be as easy to use as possible. Since designers themselves often use in-house level design tools to create their own game levels, that should make sense. I'm not sure, therefore, why the RPG Maker 3 tools seem so cumbersome.Yes, the user needs to be able to think in 3D space, and yes they MUST have a keyboard. That's not an unreasonable request if you're typing in dialogue. And yes, the user needs a few memory cards! When I'm doing song creation on my home PC, I have a very large hard drive to work with. I completely expect when I'm designing games on my PS2 that I have a few memory cards to work with, to save variations of my games and keep backup copies.That all being said, the game tools should be very easy to use, well organized, and easy to see. RPG Maker 3 just doesn't seem to come through on those points. The command sets are not always intuitive. The graphics are not PS2 worthy. And the components ...You would think the actual components you had to work with would be relatively high quality. But they're not. The textures, character models, sounds, animations, and virtually every other aspect of your ""building blocks"" could really be improved. This is in essence the easiest part of the software product for them to have done right! There are trillions of character models out there in a wide variety of games. Why only provide a few stereotypical ones? PS2 developers have done some amazing things with textures and organic objects. Why give us cheezy low-rez versions? It was really rather surprising the low level of items provided with which to make your game.I am a developer and I fully realize how hard it is to create a game. I understand that the best games come from learning the actual base level language that the console understands, and to work with that. That being said, I have used MANY level generators for games which are easy to use and which provide amazingly good graphics. Usually those level generators are provided as free bonus items included with a full length regular game. For this RPG Maker to sell as a standalone software product - and to have *poorer* level generation and building blocks - makes little sense to me.Not Well Recommended.",2,Not as Good as Many Free Level Generators,1157155200,"09 2, 2006"

I especially love how the building collapses and changes the environment. The control feels good, and it feel like it has good impact while shooting. I played the single player on hard mode, and it was challenging. Not because it's hard, but random deaths made it very annoying to play through. Occasionally, I would just die out of nowhere from a random grenades that I didn't even know was there. Maybe because the game is on hard, so I don't get any indicators... but it gets pretty frustrating and I find myself not enjoying it too much. I gave up halfway through, and started a new game on co-op campaign. Also, I really don't like the new God of War like timing action sequence. I have no intention of going back to finish it.The Co-Op missions were a lot more fun to play, when it worked. The server went down most of the time, but I guess that is to be true to any game releases. The co-op just seems a lot more interesting and a lot more exciting playing with a friend. I really wish they would make the whole game this way. The whole co-op levels only lasted about 3 hours, which was pretty disappointing since that was more enjoyable than the single player campaign.The Multiplayer portion of the game is where I will be spending the rest of my time. The matchmaker for the console is a lot better than the PC version. I was able to get in and out of games relatively quick (again, when it worked). Also, I noticed that when I get disconnected from the server I lost all my progress... it sucks to be playing for 30 minutes, and get disconnected I ended up losing my upgrades during the match.Multiplayer on small maps can also get very frustrating, because it seems like everyone is crawling around and camping. If you're used to running forward and rushing the map... you will probably get mowed down. For some reason people tend to just bunch up at a chock point and a single grenade would just kill 3-5 people instantly. I just played as an assault with a defibrillator and level up really fast reviving people. With debris and bullets whizzing by all around you, it really does make it feel as if you were in the battlefield. It's a entertaining game overall, but gets very frustrating at the same time.There are bugs and glitches still on the release copy, but I know it will be patched in the future. Overall, I like the experience, but I really do hate the single player campaign. They should make more of the co-op missions.

1793,197973,A57Q87B0TC9IJ,B006WQR3OM,Derek G,"[3, 5]","The original XCOM was a classic and, honestly, I was worried this would be ruined like so many remakes.  I underestimated Sid Meier and company as they have stayed somewhat true to the original and have improved upon it in a number of ways.  Some may complain that it has been simplified for accessibility to new players.  That is true, but XCOM: Enemy Unknown has managed to keep the deep strategy and addictiveness of the original.  Unlike the original, you can now choose from easy to tough-as-nails difficulty that will have you in tears if you make a single mistake.Like all great games, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is about choice and consequence.  You are the commander of an elite group of soldiers charged with the task of defending Earth from an alien invasion.  You decide how to equip your soldiers, where to send them and how to plan their attack formation, then each side takes their turn attacking and defending similar to a chess game.  Once the battle is finished, you return to base to use your victory to research alien materials and engineer more powerful equipment, or to lick your wounds and hire soldiers to replace the ones who were lost.  If your soldiers rack up victories, they rise in rank and acquire new powerful skills that can mean the difference between victory and defeat in tough battles.  Because of this, it's very easy to become emotionally invested in these digital characters, adding to the ""just one more turn"" addictiveness of the game.Unfortunately for you, the aliens don't care about your planet or your soldiers so they do everything they can to stop your advance.  The aliens are usually tougher, with more advanced weaponry which often leads to a feeling of being over-matched from the beginning.  With smart tactics and sheer force of will, not to mention a healthy sense of intuition and a little luck, you can defeat these powerful beings, learn from them, and possibly defeat them with their own weaponry.The graphics are nice, although reflecting the limitations of ten-year old console hardware.  The cutscenes are infrequent, serving mostly to introduce each new advance in technology.  The AI is decent, sometimes showing what seems to be intelligent beings working together to defeat you, and the many different ways your missions can end in success or failure ensures lots of replayability.  You can customize many things about your squad, including their names, (I tend to revert to juvenile namecalling like ""Colonel Sanders"" or ""Major Brownnoser"".)  A special mention should also go out to the soundtrack composer, who adds excitement and momentum to a turn-based strategy game.  Multiplayer adds what fans of the original wished was possible.  So why only three stars?Well, to start, some fun features of the original XCOM have been removed, most notably the ""base invasions"" where the alien threat finds and attacks your base and possibly cripples your advancement.  I may be prejudging here, but it also seems like a lot of the variety of different alien invasion scenarios have been replaced with just a few areas to do battle in.  This may actually hurt the game's replayability.  The world's most elite soldiers suddenly ""panicking"" over a single hit by an alien seems a little bizarre and, without spoiling anything, the ending isn't bad but it's not good either.  Finally, positioning your troops with a mouse is sometimes frustrating, especially since this encompasses a major part of the game. None of these issues are particularly horrible and, frankly, Firaxis would be missing some prime DLC opportunities if they didn't add additional places to do battle in.  If these were the only issues I would still consider it a contender for Game of the Year.What causes me to drop this game from five to three stars is all of the unforgivable bugs.  When the game was first released it was borderline unplayable on PC.  Even now, after multiple patches, you run into situations that make you want to pull your hair out.  For a game tough enough to force you to only make few mistakes during a 30-40 hour playthrough, the number of mistakes it makes will often cause and unnecessary and avoidable death of one of your squad.  Aliens will ""mysteriously"" teleport next to you, one of your squad may get stuck inexplicably, or an alien may walk into clear view of a squad on overwatch without being fired upon.  Whatever calculates your percentage chance to hit doesn't always to take objects and cover (or the lack of these things) into consideration.  There are times when you can be standing directly next to an alien and have less than 100% chance to hit, your UFO Interceptor aircraft may fly off and never return, sometimes your HUD will disappear, and on and on...  It's simply inexcusable to release a game with so many problems, particularly a game like XCOM where success is dependent upon limited mistakes.As much as I love playing this game, (when it works correctly), I simply cannot recommend it in its current state.  Perhaps when Firaxis releases a ""Complete Edition"" with all DLC it will be patched up and working.  Be sure to ask around before purchasing though.  Also, beware of any website that attempts to award this ""Game of the Year"" (looking at you, Kotaku...) because it doesn't deserve it in its unfinished state.  Often developers will make excuses about how games are so expensive to make, but you never hear about all the revenue losses from gamers who were willing to pay full price but waited for the game to go on sale after hearing about the game's many problems.",3,A Game of the Year candidate ruined by the rush to release,1358208000,"01 15, 2013"

As many of the reviews have said before me, the seventh installment of the COD series introduces gamers to the same tried and true formula everyone has grown to love (or hate) about this popular FPS. Run, gun, kill, die, respawn, repeat. Some absolutely love this type of gameplay, I guess they just get an adrenaline rush from it. So the people I'm talking about will no doubt give this game 5 stars. While I can get into this type of play, many players are already deciding to camp. The killcams prove my adversary was simply sitting near a wall with their weapon aimed for any unfortunate soul to run around the corner. The maps aren't as camp-friendly as MW2, but I see Black Ops turning into something very similar as more players progress and unlock more things. I for one don't want a 60's era MW2. Another aspect of this game I feel has taken a step back are the maps. A couple stand out, but the most frequently played were dull and boring. Also, the weapons sound terrible. They sound like WaW, hollow. I guess it's a Treyarch thing. I see a lot of other reviewers agree with my opinion of this game. They don't want another MW2 and I can't blame them. Why spend $60 on a game that takes many aspects of the former and incorporates them into a different setting. I still get knifed from 10 feet away and there are care-package drops, obviously copied from MW2. Now I understand many people will find this game amazing. That's great, I'm glad you enjoy it.

RE2 alone surpasses nearly all the other horror based games that were created for the consule, and there were plenty to follow.  With the evolution of the new gaming systems came new Resident Evil games.  RE Nemsis proved to be a challenging game of cat and mouse.  RE Survivor squandered in its attempt to switch the horror genre to the first person.  Now Resident Evil is back on the Playstation after some new titles under the Nintendo name.  The suspsense and antcipation for the game were killing me so I quickly bought it when it was released in April of this year.  Little did I know that the game itself would kill me.  RE Outbreak is quite frankly the most dissapointing horror game in the storied franchise.  The game is bad, very bad, and it has a number of reasons why.  First, you can not turn a survial based game into a team effort.  The fact that you have to help nearly everyone in this game just as much as yourself is ridiculous.  The game doesn't allow you to focus on the tasks and puzzles at hand, not to mention the 5 billion zombies that are thrown your way.  The loading screens are absolutely agonizing.  They were never good on the PSOne, so you think with the adaption to the PS2 this minor glich would get cleared up.  Oops.  The story is slow, the characters are dull, and the constant reptitive lines spoken by them is enough to make you want to turn into a zombie.  Oh wait, you can in this game, and then kill all of your teammates.  What?  Who came up with that brillant idea?  With such a storied past you think Capcom would play off its original success.

A win-win for the gamers.Unfortunately though, it turns out that the developers don't know their fans. The game becomes insanely difficult towards the end. Puzzles become completely illogical and require a lot of trial and error for solving them. What adds to the frustration is that this is a portable game and many times, you won't be playing this in a place where you have a pen/paper close. And no, can't use the screen, when this spans multiple levels.Controls - never an issue before - become extremely frustrating.

Effectively making the hours of dungeon crawling absolutely pointless. There is no equipment, save for weapons that you swap out FPS style.

Amazon.com is grouping all the 'Jedi Knight' games together which is a huge mistake, because all of them are very different.There is at least a five-year gap between Jedi Knight and its sequel, Outcast. In this game, Kyle Katarn learns about his force heritage and must battle 7 Dark Jedi led by Jerec for control of the Valley of the Jedi. In all honesty, while this game was hailed as a classic and received many 'game of the year' awards during its initial release, it hasn't aged well. Most polygon-based shooters dont, and it's somewhat painful to look back on the rudimentary character models and textures (though the basic level design itself is still top notch). Outcast also improved on everything that Jedi Knight brought to the table, including a better lightsaber combat system and better implementation of force powers. I won't deny that the game was an absolute blast to play through years ago, but nostalogic value alone doesn't make this one worth picking up.What DOES make it worth picking up though, is that the game featured an intricate story told through cutscenes with live actors. Everyone is shot on a bluescreen, sure, but the acting is mostly up to Star Wars standards, and it's worth buying to unlock all the cinemas and watch this cool Star Wars footage.As a game, there's really no reason to pick up the original Jedi Knight anymore, but if you're interested in viewing the cutscenes, then this is an absolute must-have.

The way people have been trashing this game is almost like they just played Big Rigs:  Over the Road Racing (considered by many to be possibly the worst videogame ever).  True, there are some things missing from Duke Nukem 3D that should have been in Duke Nukem Forever, but it still has a lot of good things as well, along with maintaining an unmistakeable ""Duke Nukem"" feeling, so it doesn't deserve so much of the backlash that it's gotten.STORYIt's been quite a few years since the last time Duke Nukem kicked alien butt, and after attaining so much fame for his deeds, he's now franchising himself like crazy.  However, the aliens have not learned their lesson and are back to wreak havoc and steal Duke's babes.  With the babes being abducted and Duke's various businesses being destroyed, he's mad and ready to unleash lots of pain to the alien invaders.As you can tell by the story, it's not on the same caliber of storylines like those in the Mass Effect or Deus Ex series, and it's not supposed to, this game is all about fun.ATMOSPHEREWhile the gameplay is the most important part of any game (more on that later), one of the most important parts of a Duke Nukem game is atmosphere.  DNF makes no bones about being a crude, violent, sexual, and humorous rollercoaster ride of over-the-top action.  Much like in DN3D, there's lots of one-liners spewed from Duke.  If you're a fan of classic 80's and early 90's action films like Escape from New York, Robocop, Total Recall, and Commando, then you're gonna have a ball with all of Duke's one-liners that reference said films.Personally, one of my favorite Duke quotes is when after you kill one of the Cycloid floating tentacle monsters, he'll sometimes say ""Take your tentacles and go back to Japan!!"" (not quoted verbatim).Also, there's some more modern humor to make the game more ""relevant,"" but thankfully doesn't water down the original Duke Nukem-styled humor.  Examples of this would be in some parts of the single-player mode, an EDF (Earth Defense Force) soldier states to Duke that ""Your power armor is ready, sir!"", and Duke replies ""Power armor is for p*ssies!!"", which is an obvious jab at the Halo franchise.  Another example includes a film director behind a late night TV stage berating one of his crew in parody of Christian Bale's infamous meltdown on the director of photography on the set of Terminator:  Salvation (even better is that you get a Steam Achievement for punching the director).  The last example is that when you interact with one of the phones in the game, you hear a voice message that's in the same spirit as Bill Lumberg's voice messages in Office Space stating ""Mmm, yeah I'm going to have to go ahead and ask you to come in on Sunday.""There's even a parody of the Olson twins named the Wholesome twins, and I seriously doubt the Olson twins would be flattered with their portrayal in this game.GAMEPLAYWhat's a videogame without good gameplay?  Fortunately, DNF has good gameplay to go behind the crude, violent, and humorous atmosphere.  While a lot of the game is the good old fashioned gun fights and big explosions against alien ""pigcops"" and jetpack-wearing aliens, there's also some nice variations from the over-the-top action.There's some nifty puzzle sections that while not as brain-twisting as those in the Half-Life games, is nonetheless a nice addition to the game.  Also, there's some fun platforming sections like when you're shrunken inside a Duke Burger and have to save a pretty female employee from a flooded kitchen with loose live electrical wires.  This platforming section in particular is also mixed with some neat gun battles with some pigcops.  There's even a section in the game that has you ride through the desert towards the Hoover Dam in a monster truck the Duke named ""Mighty Foot.""  These stages are fun since you can utilize the truck's built-in jet-boosters to get over some canyons and to get some great speed to turn your alien enemies into roadkill.One of the things that was lauded about DN3D was the interactive environment, and thankfully, it's back in DNF.  Among my favorite and most crude interactions you can do in this game is take a leak in a toilet or urinal when you want a little break from the combat.I personally like the moments in the game where you get shrunken through alien shrink rays and have to navigate the world as a tiny Duke.  This leads to some interesting interactions like having to platform through a dangerous series of cogs in the Hoover Dam, and hearing Duke with a high-pitched voice is quite funny.There's some neat power-ups that totally match the spirit of the Duke Nukem franchise.  Your sunglasses provide ""Duke Vision,"" which allows you to see in the dark, and this has infinite supply.  There's one-time use power-ups like beer, steroids, and the holoduke.  The beer slows you down but makes you more resistant to damage, steroids make you crazy and run around killing enemies with one or two punches, and the holoduke makes you invisible while fooling your enemies into shooting a holographic projection of yourself.The weapons overall, fit the Duke Nukem aesthetic.  Some classics like the RPG (this comes with a target lock feature) and Shrink Ray come back in this game.  There's also some funky weapons like the Freeze Ray and the Ripper, with the latter being a three-barreled machine gun that can dish out some nasty hits to your enemies.  One of my favorites is the alien weapon called the Enforcer, which fires three target-locking missiles at once and can kill big enemies with only a few hits.  I wish some weapons like the microwave gun would have came back in DNF, though I can overlook that since the weapons in this game are still a lot of fun.CONTROLSDNF is one of the PC games that allows for both control through a keyboard and mouse or through an Xbox 360 controller plugged into your computer.  I used the Xbox 360 controller through the game and the game even has control prompts with the Xbox 360 controller buttons on them to allow for easier controls than some other games that say something like ""Press button E to climb the ladder.""  The buttons are used in a logical order similar to most FPS titles and thankfully, all the controls in the game are immediately responsive to your interactions with the controller.GRAPHICSI've only played the PC version of DNF, so I can't really comment on the quality of the graphics on the Xbox 360 and PS3 ports of the game.  With that said, while the graphics may not be up to par with games like Metro 2033 and Crysis 2, I think the graphics on DNF are better than the myth that they're no better than on Doom 3.  When you max out all of the graphics settings, you actually get nicely-detailed items, people, and environments that I'd say is probably worthy of competing with a 2008 game with top-shelf graphics quality.  Besides, graphics aren't everything.  What matters most is the gameplay and atmosphere.SOUND/SOUNDTRACKThe sound in this game comes in crystal clear, and the sound effects for various actions in the game feel just right for what you do.  I think especially with the gun sounds, they have a nice punch to them, and go well with the over-the-top feeling of the game.The music is good, too.  There's some decent hard rock riffs in the background that match the macho, ""one man army"" feeling in this game.  There's a more traditional classical score in the background in most levels, and the melodies feel right at home with the scores of action films of the 80's and early 90's, which fits in perfectly with this game.COMPLAINTSWhile I do like this game, it's not without some complaints.  I don't like the fact that until you beat the game, you're restricted to carrying only two weapons at a time (if you beat the game, you get an inventory expansion option to carry four weapons at a time).  I think when Gearbox was finishing development of this game, they should have had the inventory set up so that you could carry all weapons like in DN3D.  Also, the levels seem a little too linear compared to its predecessor (though you can rummage through lockers and crates to get weapons and power-ups), and there's no jetpacks in the game.  However, I think in the big picture, these faults don't do too much to degrade the overall quality of the game.MATURE CONTENTThis is NOT a game for the kids.  This game has a lot of scantly-clad and half-naked women and even some Giger-esque visuals like ""wall boobs"" in some alien dwellings.  There's also a lot of profanity-laden humor and insults, along with bodily waste and gore.  The gore goes beyond copious bloodshed to even included dismemberment and exploding corpses.  In some boss battles, you actually rip off some alien battle lords' horns and stab them in the eyes with them.FINAL WORDDon't listen to all the negative backlash this game has got.  This game set out to be a slab of crude FPS fun, and it succeeds.  If you're looking for a FPS that's all about crude fun, then I'm sure you'll be satisfied with DNF, especially with its current price.  I think this game is a much-needed break from the current climate of the FPS genre being totally serious and realistic (not to mention being too derivative of each other).  This is a game worth owning, and is also a good companion piece to Bulletstorm.",4,"This Duke isn't quite A #1, but still really good.  80%",1343347200,"07 27, 2012"
776,171386,AC6LV5D2RKTIR,B004FYEZMQ,"Michigoon ""tech geek""","[27, 35]","Let me preface this review by stating that I'm sure the the first and second Mass Effect games would be in my list of the Top 100 Games of All-Time, and probably nearer to the top. Mass Effect 1 was an incredible blend of old-school sci-fi noir and modern gameplay mechanics. Mass Effect 2 was a darker spin on that universe with a ""Dirty Dozen"" vibe of team-building. Mass Effect 3 is, for someone who enjoyed the first two games, a slap in the face. I will try to avoid spoilers for ME3 as much as possible, with minor spoilers for ME1 and ME2.What went wrong?-Not My Character. The entire point of this trilogy is that a player could create a custom character in the first game, and their decisions can be imported across both sequels so that everything in the third game is customized based on past decisions across both prequels. Sounds great, right? Well, Bioware admitted they didn't actually have anyone test this for the third game, and it turns out if you imported the same character from ME1 to ME2 and want to cross over to ME3, your save file is unreadable and you will be forced to play a default character instead. Bioware claim they're looking at implementing a fix now that they've been told about this, but launching the game without this feature is inexcusable. (Technical note: Your save data will only work if you made changes to your character's face during the import from ME1 to ME2, but this was not stated at the time, and why would you do that if you bothered to import your character in the first place?)-Not My Decisions. Again, a major marketing point of the trilogy was the ability for your decisions to have impact across all three games. In the end however, you will be given a choice between three mostly prefabricated endings, and the biggest difference between those is a color change. Red, Blue, or Green. That's all your decision-making across three games has mattered, swapping some colors. Throughout Mass Effect 3 (and, to a lesser extent, ME2) your decisions don't really have major effects anyway. Let a character die, and they'll be replaced in the next game by a similarly-named character with nearly identical looks and dialog. Or worse, you just won't be presented with a certain quest option, and thus have no clue at all what you missed. There really aren't any penalties for any decisions you have made or will make, and the fate of the galaxy depends more on playing multiplayer than anything else you do.-Not My Ending. Okay, I'll admit, I wanted a happy ending to the series. But I had good reason to hope for this. The entire point of ME1 and ME2 is that Shepard is the lone hero, the only force in the galaxy that can overcome insurmountable odds to win the day and save the galaxy. Shepard literally returned from the dead during the second game, yet during the third we are presented with a true no-win situation. Not to spoil any specifics, but all three endings involve crushing defeat. You as a player have control over neither of these story options (Shepard's death in 2 and all endings in 3 are almost entirely pre-scripted). So which is it Bioware- is Shepard an unstoppable juggernaut of hope, or the tragically fated hero? You can't have both.-Not My Galactic Readiness- Or is it EMS? Supposedly in ME3, the fate of the galaxy depends on the galactic readiness, which measures all the assets you've prepared to fight the bad guys. Only there are actually two statistics, and you're not really told which is which, so you might look at the wrong one for most of the game (You actually want Effective Military Strength, because Galactic Readiness only boosts EMS, even though Galactic Readiness seems like the important-sounding one). It also turns out Galactic Readiness can only be improved by playing multiplayer or the iOS app for mobile devices, while EMS can only be improved in singleplayer- which you probably won't pick up in-game. So you cannot change Galactic Readiness at all in the singleplayer game, and this doesn't seem to be stated clearly in the game itself. And although Bioware promise there's enough stuff in singleplayer to boost EMS to the necessary levels, most people report getting one of the ""bad"" endings despite completing what they thought was 100% of the game. Got that? I didn't. It's a mess.There are a lot of other reasons to hate ME3. Savvy internet folk have noticed that major elements of ME3 have been ripped off of internet resources, including major aspects of the game being based off of years-old stock photographs that the developers spruced up in Photoshop. Publishers Electronic Arts are still trying to bilk people's wallets by selling Cerberus Network passes to people who don't buy the game new, which also requires signing up for EA services just to unlock the features. There's been heavy hinting that the lackluster ending of ME3 will be patched up in future Downloadable Content- which you can bet you'll have to pay for (especially if you don't want to pony up for Cerberus Network by handing your personal information to EA). The forces that be stopped so low as to charge money for new character clothing in the last game, and you can bet they'll bring that back for this game.In the end, there are a few moments in this game that are absolutely praiseworthy (Mordin's storyline in particular is brought to an incredible climax), but it's just not worth it. If you played ME1 and ME2 with the hopes of seeing your same character in the third game, odds are you literally can't do that unless the game has been patched in the meantime, so just go with the story you made up in your head and be happy with it. Don't let Bioware and EA ruin the good memories you forged in the first two games.",1,This generation's Daikatana? Worse- Daikatana wasn't a sequel.,1332028800,"03 18, 2012"

I thought it would at least be as good as the others (with the first being my favorite). This game was a major disappointment. I wanted to get through the game before I made a review of it, and boy did it feel like a chore. Sure, it had fun moments, but there was nothing that made this game stand out and no motivation to replay it. It is apparent that EA threw this game out very quickly, likely to move on to other games such as Battlefield 4. My question: why even do it? This game is [hopefully] receiving such poor reviews that it makes them little to no profit, and it is not the least bit satisfying to those demanding a follow-up of their favorite game series. I've played and beat both predecessors and I would play either of those games over this game any day. Like many reviews of this game have stated, this game is simply ""here"". And it won't be for long. The graphics in this game are not impressive. The destructibility of the environment is pretty cool, but the environment and people themselves make it not very good. The gameplay is okay. The shooting is expected, the player movement is annoying and unnecessarily challenging, and the controls are unbelievably bad. I mean unbelievably because that is usually a given positive aspect in a game. Anything that would and should make this game good, aren't there. And everything that is unnecessary and pointless that you don't want to see is there. ""Aggro"", an awesome way of using your partner to attract attention so you can sneak around a turret or a tough guy, isn't there. ""Two Vision"", a way supposedly to see different ways of progressing through settings that I never used one time beating the game on Hard difficulty, is there. The story, characters, and setting are all generic, uncreative, and easily forgettable. Even someone who has never played previous AOT's can see the ""climaxes"" of the story coming from a mile away. The new players, Alpha and Bravo are basically blank, unfinished characters. Right when you think they are about to develop a personality and possibly a fan-base, they sink into an expected, boring tone. Their dialogue is just more of what you would expect in a shooter, nothing more. Overkill is pretty cool, because it helps you get past tough/ a lot of enemies and can really save you. Your partner [when playing solo] can really save you too. The enemy AI, however, is horrible. The dumbest, most stereotypical enemies run at you blindly asking to die. Everything in this game just happens to be put in where it kind of closes itself off. Moral choices, along with anything that can deviate or change the main story, are gone. This is obviously a game that EA said, ""We are going to put the bare minimum of a shooter into this game, hype it up like a real game, and make some money"". It truly is the bare minimum. Not only is it a disappointing story, but that's it. No multiplayer, no side story, no wave defense modes, no challenges, nothing. The bare minimum.***PLEASE READ***THE BEST CASE SCENARIO FOR THIS GAME IS THAT YOU RENT IT OR BUY IT REALLY CHEAP WHEN YOU HAVE A FRIEND OR RELATIVE AT YOUR HOUSE TO PLAY IT WITH.

I can forgive the game to a certain extent for the recycling, but what I cannot accept is how bad the map design, respawns, and matchmaking system is. The maps are smaller than ever, circular mazes of narrow alleys littered with random junk and enemies respawning behind you. 80% of your deaths will be someone who respawned and shot you in your back. Apparently Infinity Ward learned nothing from the failure of the matchmaking system in Modern Warfare 2 as the exact same system is back in full force, and that once again means you cannot kick the many hackers, cheaters, racists, and flamers you will inevitably meet, this of course not counting the fact that you will often experience lag in games where you will shoot half your clip only to see in the killcam that you were standing like an idiot and only managing to fire off 2 bullets.The inclusion of dedicated servers would have fixed 1/2 the issues of what is an ""okay"" game, but sadly it is not to be.

""An honest reviewer""","[2, 4]","After recently buying NBA 2K7 and NBA live 07 I will do my best to compare the two games.NBA Live 07:PROS: I've heard alot about the terrific graphics of 2K7, but I thought NBA Live actually has better graphics. The new ""freestyle"" controls are an improvement over the lagging controller to game responses of 06 and they allow you to take over any given game. The soundtrack is also the best I've ever heard in an NBA game.Cons: Since the opponents also have freestyle controls, one player from their team will usually have terrific stats as well(I've had Chris Webber drop 51 points and 27 Boards.) Having said that the graphics are better on this game, it all depends on the camera angle. I recommend press box.NBA 2k7:Pros: This year's association is by far better than franchise mode in NBA live, with new 3 team trades and award races. This game also has much smoother gameplay than NBA Live. Sorry, not many more pros to this one.Cons: My biggest disappointment this year is that the game is basically the same as last year's game. Shaq is on the cover AGAIN and the graphics are completely unchanged, despite all the hype around them. The reason I bought the game in the first place was because this game claims that one of its game modes allows you to ""Create a player and guide him through an elite NBA career-Train him, improve his skills and outshine your competition to land endorsement deals and your own shoe contract."" It's not on the game at all. I figured that might be on the new 24/7 mode, but that's not on there either!Overall, I recommend that if you are a sports fan - buy Madden 07, but if you must have a NBA game this year then go with NBA 07.

I know them because I had them as well.The seventies sucked.  Playing as members in a street gang during the seventies, surrounded by afros and leather vests sucks as well.  But believe it or not...this game is good.Flawed, yes...but damn good.The fighting engine in this baby is incredible, as are the combo moves and the general elements of mayhem open to the player.At any given point you can mug people, steal car radios, break into jewelry stores, etc. etc.The story mode itself is a plethora of (pinatas) mini-games that are actually well-imagined and fun.  After every mission you return to the ""hangout"", where you can choose to advance to the next level, free-roam, workout, or enter ""rumble mode""---which is worth the price of the game itself.You can create a gang from the many members of every gang featured, and pit them against a CPU gang or against your pals.The game is extremely brutal, even more so than the GTA series, and it has moments of hilarity.  Your fellow gang bangers are not outside of your wrath.  While chilling in the hangout, pick up a chair, start a conversation with another gang member, and then halfway through his rant break the chair over his head.  Unlike most games, you'll actually interrupt his conversation to hear him yell, ""WHAT THE F@#$ MAN!""  or  ""COOL OUT, MAN!""This alone is worth my $50.  Pound your gang members long enough, and they'll actually get tired of your crap and beat hell from you.Best Rockstar game yet?  Let's not forget GTA3 so quickly.  And despite how groundbreaking and innovative this game is, at it's core it is still a fighting game, and can get hackneyed within eight hours of gameplay or so.However, is ""The Warriors"" a large step forward from Rockstar titles like ""Manhunt"" and ""Red Dead Revolver""?Oh yeah.",3,Never In A Million Years...,1132531200,"11 21, 2005"

9564,150583,A3LN9GOG6J96TH,B0037LTTRO,JB,"[0, 0]","As many others have said, this game is nothing like the previous Ghost Recon games. Don't try to compare it.The experience as it's own game is awful. The interface is confusing and clunky. At certain points of character progression, you're offered choices between attachments, but since your characters are split between factions and their items are completely different, you are shown the choices for the faction you're currently in. I've been playing for a bit hoping the game gets better, and I still don't know if I make a choice if it affects the other faction, because when I go into a new room and get placed on the other faction, I try to set up that faction's weapons to match the one I was just using so I can sortof know what to expect, which takes up all of the lobby time so I don't remember to go see what happened with the progression choice.If that paragraph didn't make sense, then I got my point across. The UI is too bloated with flashy/glitchy menu options and graphics to give it the futuristic technological feel, it doesn't get you right into the game like UI should.The Game Modes:Campaign - The only part you'll probably have fun with. If you have 4 people or not, some of the mechanics you encounter are pretty neat (synchronized kills, hostage-guarding formations). Some of the reviews mentioned that it's on rails - and that's exactly what it is. This game should stop trying to copy Call of Duty.Guerilla - Where Terrorist Hunt should be, you have defense against waves. This can be fun but just becomes tiresome. Lots of games have wave defense, but only Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six have had really good terrorist hunt modes.Multiplayer - The real crap. Where Ghost Recon used to have sprawling maps with cover for snipers as well as close quarters, this version of the game has more Call of Duty-esque run 'n' gun. It's also ironic that it only has objective-based multiplayer because they ""didn't want to make it run 'n' gun"". So what happens when you have an objective across the map that you have to take and defend in 60-120 seconds? Definitely not strategic combat, not with match-made strangers. In previous Ghost Recons, if you rushed a match you got to sit and wait until the next one. Sure that may not be for everyone, but just because Call of Duty recycles the same old crap and sells out doesn't mean you should copy them.Wrap-up:I've had the game since launch and given it multiple tries, and only a few brief nights of fun where the rest are just frustrating. You're going to run into better players and not win every match, but when everything changes one night to the next, there's definitely something weird going on. Some of the bullet/hit recognition is actually worse than Call of Duty Black Ops (in Black Ops, for me, it was easier to hit people with a crossbow half a block away than with an automatic weapon 4 feet away from behind). Last night in Ghost Recon, I had run off someone's screen - literally the kill cam evaluation showed me run straight past someone and they fired three times with a sniper rifle (not even scoped, just aimed down the sights) up some steps where I came from and somehow killed me. That was the kicker - that's not even lag, that's just garbage.

This time around Nintendo takes full reign and the RPG adventures of Mario continues on.Even if you never played Super Mario RPG, you can appreciate all that this game offers: a compelling story, a huge world with different areas to explore, appearances from every character in the Mario universe, new enemies and bosses, classic turn based strategy and tactics, off the wall humor and a progressing difficulty curve.

12276,118255,A1798SYP2E2KY1,B001LY0QJ4,Chris Ray,"[8, 8]","This rifle got 4 stars because I had to tweak it a bit.  Do what I did at your own risk.  If you are an impatient person and / or not mechanically inclined, you may not want to do any modifications.  The first 2 of the 4 things are pretty easy.  First, my experience is you have to be about 10+ feet (yes, I used a tape measure)from the TV in order to get the reticle to line up very closely with the sight on the rifle.  If you are too close, the reticle will not line up properly.  The downside to this is it's harder to see your targets the further back you go.  I recommend as big of a TV as you can afford. I played using my friend's 60"" flatscreen LG, and it looks and works great.  I only have a 32"" tube TV at home, but it's OK.  As a side note, I actually took the ""barrel tube"" off of the front of rifle to give it more of the shotgun look.  I'm using it for several of Remington's hunting games as a shotgun.  Second, even with the instructions, the nunchuck can be difficult to put in and take out. My experience was routing the cord thru the left slot on the inside compartment could be a little tricky.  You want to make sure the cord is routed out of the way so the C and Z buttons on the nunchuck engage properly, and also so the nunchuck itself seats properly in the compartment.  You will only need the B, A, and cross buttons for some games, so you might not even install the nunchuck sometimes.  It does give a better feel with it in there, tho.  The next steps get a little more difficult.  I had trouble with the B or trigger button sticking in in the depressed position, so I had to put a stronger spring inside to force the trigger to return further forward after a shot is fired.  So third, you need to take out all the phillips-head screws in the body (don't lose them!), cut thru the 3 stickers on the bottom of the compartments (these stickers show you where to put the controllers), and pull the 2 halves of the rifle apart.  There is a piece of plastic just ahead of the trigger guard.  It is about the size of a medium-sized piece of chewing gum and about the same thickness.  This piece has a bit of glue on it inside, so it's not going to come out easily most likely.  This is a spacer for the 2 halves, most likely so the halves don't cave in when screwed together.  Once the 2 halves are apart, you can see the linkage from the trigger up to the B button on the controller.  Luckily, I think the designers did a pretty good job on this rifle, from a ruggedness/sturdiness point of view.  I just slipped the original spring off the linkage, got a slightly longer and stronger spring, and slipped it on the linkage post, and put it back together.  If you don't have a box of springs (I bought mine from Harbor Freight Tools), your local hardware store can most likely match one up for you.  The spring needs to be strong enough to return the trigger to the forward position (without sticking) after every trigger pull, yet light enough so you don't wear your finger out trying to pull the trigger, so you may have to experiment a bit.  Fourth, I took the ring sight off the front of the barrel while I had the 2 halves apart.  It comes out easily.  If you prefer the ring sight, then leave it on.  I put the 2 halves back together, inserted my controller, and started playing.  It works great now, and I don't forsee and problems into the future.  Alot of work you say?  Of course it was.  What's it worth to you, tho?  I love my hunting games, so it was worth it for me.  I also noticed my scores have increased on every game I've played since my ""fix"".  Yes, I know I shouldn't have to do this with a gun right out of the box, but I wanted it to work better, and I thot I could fix it.  I'll probably buy another one and tweak it right out of the box.  That way myself and a buddy can play 2-player on these big game shooters.  I chose this rifle over the sniper rifle because the C and Z buttons are on the sides of the frame, not on magazine.  I read several comments about how the magazine-mounted buttons were awkward and made people get sore hands, cramps, etc.  I was playing my shooting games with a Perfect Shot Pistol prior to buying this rifle.  I am more stable using the rifle.  You can use this rifle for any game that uses the B button for the trigger.  With the nunchuck in place, all buttons are accessible on it and the main controller.  So, to recap, this would have gotten 5 stars had I not had to modify it to make it work how I thot it should work.  Hope this helps anyone who is looking to buy a rifle/shotgun.",4,Sureshot Rifle for Wii - pretty good with some tweaking,1294272000,"01 6, 2011"

Beltway then runs directly into a fire and stands there until he dies. Revive Beltway. Move to next room. Lupo suicides on trip mines that were guarding an aid spray. She can't even pick them up! Why is she going for an aid spray!?Turn game off in disgust.Update: Continued to play and got to one of the end levels where I had to re-enter Birkin's Lab.On the elevator and attacked by lickers. Killed lickers but one glitches and gets stuck in the freaking wall. My cracker-jack team decides the best thing to do is to just shoot the wall...forever. After the Licker has disappeared through the wall. I am not kidding. They all lined up and proceed to shoot at NOTHING. And because you can't issue team commands, the only way to make them stop is proceed to another check point.This is one the biggest things that I am hating about the game industry. EVERYTHING MUST have multi-player.I know that a ton of people who disagree with me will say ""Play on Xbox Live DURRR""The thing is that I shouldn't have to. That's an excuse and bull**** one at that.I understand that there are some games that have a single player campaign added as an after thought. Battlefield Bad Company 2 is a perfect example. I didn't get that impression from ""RE: ORC."" I thought it was going to be a mixture of Dead Space, and Gears of War. A solid single player experience with a strong multi-player element. And Capcom was more than happy to make people believe that. Instead they give me an amalgamation of Gears of War, Jericho and Vampire Rain.THIS GAME SUCKS. DO NOT BUY! Seriously. Spend your money on ANYTHING else. Burn it if you have to.

However, there is a much deeper reason why I am now glad I avoided this bundle. I was appalled and very disappointed with Nintendo to learn that the ""new Wii"" featured in this bundle IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE with Gamecube games. It also does not include the stand, hence why it is laying down in the picture on the box. I am not sure whether the Gamecube controller ports are also removed, but I sincerely hope not, as that is the only way I can play competitively in games such as Super Smash Brothers Brawl and Mario Kart Wii. Either way, you definitely want the bundle that is backwards compatible, a better value (not only counting the steering wheel, but immeasurable value in backwards compatibility), and, as far as I and most everybody else reviewing this product are concerned, much more fun. If you're a very casual gamer who doesn't care about backwards compatibility, as I realize many people hopping on the bandwagon of modern, casual, mainstream gaming these days are, and are OK with the not-quite-as-fast-paced-and-action-packed New Super Mario Brothers Wii (don't get me wrong, great game, and it has its thrilling moments, especially with three or four players, but just not as thrilling as Mario Kart), then this bundle will do just fine.

The makers of the series did a smart thing with COD 4 Modern Warfare,the game brought new technology, scenarios and situations to the genre, and it was excellent fun, a good rest from the back to back world war II shooters that had been beaten to death.Now with world at war, they again resort to the same old formula, and one that only took them a year to launch after COD 4 was released, probably meaning so much of it is a rehash of what they've done a million times before, that it didn't even take them much of an effort to make.Aside from the gameplay, story and situations being just extremely boring and old, there ain't much to look at graphics wise, they basically used the same engine from COD 4, which is not a bad engine, but it's over a year old and doesn't bring anything amazing to the table.My advice?, if you played one or two of these call of duty games before, you'll be getting nothing new with this one, certainly not worth the 60 dollar price.

Why? Well, first off this game has been floating around the vaporware bin since 2004 and now 5 years later we get a half done game. Where's the career mode? That's my biggest question. Instead we are forced to pick everything ourselves. This doesn't have anything to do with laziness either. I like my career modes in Gran Turismo and this is the first game in the series that doesn't have one. Another thing you'll notice missing is there's no way to upgrade your cars...ouch.Like every GT game once you start the game up you head to the dealership, but that's where the problems already start. It's random...yeah you get four or five random dealerships every day in the game. You see a car you want? Sure! Normally you just save up for it, but then when you go back the dealership is gone...why Polyphony chose this stupid idea is beyond me.The game also lies about there being 500 different cars. There are a few models of each different car so you're only looking at about 200 some odd different types of cars. The game gives you some interesting back story on each car, but viewing the stats is a nightmare since they just scroll by without a still data sheet or something of the like.Once you start getting into a race it's simple enough. Choose your track, number of laps, and the car from your garage. You can use quick tune options or do a bit of fine tuning, but the default works just fine. The number of laps and length of track determine your winning outcome, so you can always change accordingly. If you want money faster try the license tests. They range from passable to impossible thanks to the game's new and weird slipstream system. This is only normally seen in street racing games, but GT doesn't even give you any visual clues as to if you are doing this right or not. The point of the slipstream is to stay behind the opponent so they block the wind for you giving you a small boost in speed. While it works on paper it's very hard to execute in the game.Once you start racing you are in for a treat because the cars feel very close to their console counterparts, and it feels like our beloved GT. The game even sports an impressive cockpit view for the tiny handheld that could and not just the floating rear view mirror view we've been accustomed to seeing pre-PS3. Each car handles differently and buying and stocking is a  lot of fun, but without a career mode, vehicle upgrades, or even an online mode it makes you wonder why they even bothered. All of the most beloved features of GT have been stripped out as joke to us fans waiting for GT5.When it comes to the looks the game delivers, but I know it could be pushed just a bit farther. The vehicles look like no other racer on the system, but the tracks are lacking a bit. Still, the game accomplishes a lot more than most PSP games ever have. The audio however is also a bit of a disappointment, with a dull soundtrack, and a lot of the engines sounds sound the same as well as sounding a bit tinny. This is probably for hardcore fans only so fans of other PSP racers should stay away.",3,The lack of a simulation mode makes the game boring quick,1332892800,"03 28, 2012"

Also keep in mind that this review IS coming from someone who has played the first, which many who played this one have apparently not played.---Minimal Spoiler Below/Major Spoilers for FIRST GAME---Story: The hero, who I swear had a name in the first game, is held captive by Gandohar, the antagonist of the first game. The heros sister, Kyra, is being used as a conduit for his magical energies and the hero is used to restore the energy Gandohar saps from Kyra. As the heros strength weakens and escape seems impossible, he is saved by an unlikely ally, the Orcs. With their help, he sets out to kill Gandohar and rescue Kyra.Graphics: The graphics aren't much different than that of Two Worlds, they are slightly improved, but barely so. There are little special effects in the game and are all in all rather bland and dull, but not terrible, they won't make you stop playing, but they won't stand out either.Controls: The controls have received a complete overhaul this time, you'll actually use more than just the trigger and a few button for combat. Skills can be allocated to various buttons making for much easier combat. This is one of the few areas that I felt were extremely well done compared to the first. Talking, buying, sneaking, blocking and everything else just feel so much easier than they did before.Music/voice: The voices in the previous Two Worlds were mediocre, but not terrible and sadly some of the better works done at that time. They are done much the same this time, the game still suffers from a seemingly lack of translation or mistranslated, meaning the character says one thing, but what appears in text is something different. Although not game destroying, can be annoying. Music is to the same effect as the previous title, quite and low while doing anything, but picks up when in combat (or maybe I just had the music turned down in the options....).Other: Multi-player makes its debut and, while populated, is generally filled with either modders, newbies or trolls. If you can find a community (the TW2 forums?) you can probably get a group to play with. There is a separate smaller story in MP, which is pretty fun and easy, a Versus and a sort of village builder. All worth checking out if you have access to them.Achievements: For those who like achievements, you'll need a group of at least 4 to do the versus and some of the co-op story, as it can be a pain without 4 people. Other than that, they are pretty easy, especially if you got 1,000 on Two Worlds.Pro:- MUCH better all around- Easier to play- Interesting storyCons:- Feels a bit dated- Unpolished in some areas- Bad Multi-player",4,Much Better than the First,1361750400,"02 25, 2013"

I will not bore you with details about the plot or characters, you can read other reviews for that.

With this machine the game plays very smoothly and graphics are some of the best I have seen so far. As far as playing on lower end machines, I would have to say you probably would not have as many problems as you may think. You can always &quot;tweak&quot; settings to your system. I would stay with a Pentium 2,3,4, or Athlon only. The speed probably would not be as big a factor as your graphic card.  The game play kind of like Battlezone. You are in 3rd person view and can control you players and participate in battles. There are some resource management in the form of &quot;souls&quot;. The more souls you get(from battling opponents), the more troops you can build. This is a very easy to master setup.  The learning curve is not steep at all.

9541,179302,A3AF8GQGBCEO73,B004YVOCYG,D. Ross,"[1, 3]","I first rented this game to test it out as I've been leary of Ubisoft with some of their policies which I will not get into.  I own the other three installments of the game and absolutely loved Brotherhood.  I'm glad they kept a lot of the game mechanics from Brotherhood which really made the game enjoyable.In my opinion, the issue with this game is that someone had a great idea to add a tower defense type mini-game to AC:R and the developer decided that it was such a great idea, they were going to force players to play it.  If you didn't play it, then they added a punishment system.At first, I was floored by the defense game.  I thought it was an awesome addition to the game.  After the first tutorial defense game, I was begging for more.  Then the second game came, and it was very frustrating.  Try to picture a defense game where they added flying mobs, but you are not giving an adequate air-defense tower yet.  It was like fighting an uphill battle.  The third battle went a little easier because they ended up giving the so called next ""tower"" that allowed a better match up.They changed the notoriety system to where it is easier to gain notoriety and harder to get rid of it.  Picture GTA where you get a police star everytime you hit every other car while driving and you can no longer outrun cops as an option to get rid of it (leaving only paint shops to remove stars); it would become tedious dealing with stars or watching your driving instead of being able to play the game.  To get rid of notoriety you have to either bribe someone or find and assassinate the inquisitor discreetly.  You can assassinate him openly, but it will only delay the inevitable defense game.  If you fail the defense game, then you lose your shops and ability to recruit additional assassins.  Sometimes the defense game gets so frustrating you just end up letting the computer win so you can just get it back by assasinating the head templar of the region.  The only way around it is to level up your assassins to lvl 15 so they can defend themselves, but by then you are about done with the game.  So my recomendation is to do your exploring and collecting at the end when you have some protection against being punished from running on roofs or running into guards.Even assasinations have taken on an additional air of difficulty.  Before you tended to have some leeway if you were poor at stealth or just wanted to quickly dispatch someone.  They would give you multiple options and paths to get to your prey.  Now, I feel as though I'm limited to one or two paths of attack.  Crowds that you can blend with end up only going in one direction, so when i get to an intersection everyone in the crowd will go one way, and no one goes the other.  So I end up spending time going against the flow looking for the intersection where crowds are going in different directions.  This causes assassinations to consume a lot of time otherwise the target may end up fleeing and not be available again till the next day.I love the new hookblade.  It is available at the beginning of the game, and allows you to reach almost anyplace you need as well as provide some protection from an accidental fall.  Also I like the subway system is now free and fully available which sort of makes up for being unable to freely run the rooftops.Overall, the storyline is great, which is one of my favorite parts of the AC series.  I still enjoy playing the game, mostly because a lot of the mechanics from the previous series are still present.  Hopefully the next installment of the game will fix a lot of the frustrating parts of this game such as building a player friendly defense game sans the punishment system.  As you can see by my reviwer tag, I did end up buying the game.  Although I spent a lot of time talking about negative aspects of the game, it is still a great game especially the game mechanics that stick to previous versions.  If you ever played any of the other games in the series, then more than likely your decision is limited to either rent or buy.  If you never played AC, in my opinion you should start with the last game AC:Brotherhood as it was the best in the series in my humble opinion.  My three star rating is due to the fact that I am unable to play the game for any long period of time due to above mentioned frustrations.",3,great game with frustrating parts,1323907200,"12 15, 2011"

WTF? Seriously? I feel off some cliffs several times because of the issue of not being able to see where you're going. So far, I can't seem to find a way to change the camera angle manually or tell it to stop changing camera angle on its own accord. I'd much prefer the camera angle simply be directly behind you so you can see where you're going. The camera ""getting in your way"" really doesn't help things at all.I gave it a day and tried it again, and the same camera issues came up.I haven't even gotten to the point where I can really effectively ""play"" the game to see whether the actual gameplay mechanics are fun or not.So far this has prevented me from ""enjoying"" this game and is something of a deal breaker.

The controls are very clunky, the camera is never in the right place, and let's face it, the paint and thinner mechanic is a bit less expressive as we may have all hoped. In almost every regard, this is an above average game at best. That's being really optimistic though. On everything else but the gameplay, I really think this title shines. It is a tribute to all things Disney, particularly the things that we have forgotten. Unlike some corporate project that would just be wanting to make a quick buck off the Mickey franchise, this title really seems like a lot of care went into it. The story is interesting, the universe is expansive, and the main characters are deeper than you can imagine. For me personally, this was a trip back to my childhood. I remembered the family trip to Disney World, all the old cartoons, and how these characters brought a smile to my face. I get excited thinking and talking about Mickey and Disney, even though beforehand I felt too old to be excited about such things. In that regard, to me personally, I think it had a very lasting and positive effect after playing. If you are a fan of Mickey, Disney, and follow the story, the gameplay will mean a lot less and you'll enjoy this title.

You can play regular Wii games on the Wii-U, but it is painful, the controller selections are erratic and too hard for a child to manage and the game is slow.Choosing the songs and setting up the players with the controller and the finger pointer on the screen is just as horrible as I remember.  The original Wii was bad in the early days.  Getting the pointer in a wii regular game to center on a selection is impossible for small children because the movements are jerky and erratic.  The Wii-U is superior and much more intuitive and easy with the added bonus of the Wii-pad.The early Wii games did not put a lot of thought into how you selected things in the game.  This Disney Just Dance game is one of the worst.Your first task is to select 'kids' or 'parents' with the epileptic erratic movement, shaky controller.Then you must click 'next' to confirm it with that same erratic controller...Next level of difficulty is scrolling through and choosing which song to dance to.Then you must gingerly click next to move ahead in the game.But wait.  There's more!The next level is even harder.  Each kid with a controller (usually young children) must pick an smiley face icon to represent them (Impossible for small hands, and the adult must step in.  This is done with EVERY song.)Again confirm by mastering the tricky task of clicking 'next' again with the blasted controller.Don't get your hopes up because you are not done yetThe subsequent screen asks each kid with erratic controller to pick which dancer they want to play by maneuvering the tricky pointing finger and choosing a box.  The children are usually in tears by the point and Adult necessary to step in to do this for each child, and then click the 'next' again.You're not even close to getting the kids dancing yet...Another screen pops up asks you to use the shaky controller to pick the tiny circle of the nations flag of which language you want the song to play in.  The kids are in full melt down by this point and Wii needs you to pick the 'english' version of each song every time because it does not remember what your settings are between songs.And when you finally get to click the box to play the Disney song you sit down on to find that the Disney songs are shortened for young kids and that game play will last all of 45 seconds.Then for the kids to play another song you get to repeat this process that takes five minutes to set up each and every song the kids want.It is maddening to say the least.  Especially with the controller that is never on target or easy to master.Come on Disney....  Make a Wii-U version of the game and you could probably name your price.

Sherman ""The Critic""","[2, 2]","Pumped from watching the trailer where Tekken director Katsuhiro Harada headbutts Street Fighter producer Yoshinori Ono, fans bum-rushed the stores to get their hands on Nintendo's first Tekken game since Tekken Advance for the Gameboy Advance.  But what did they actually get?What they got appears to be a watered-down port of Tekken 6 (Which would explain the faster loading times).  How watered-down is it?  For starters, it has a lengthy survival mode, local and online multiplayer, a standard arcade mode, a practice mode, player stats, and you fight for rank and points that go toward special virtual trading cards.  Tekken Advance couldn't come close to matching the 60fps that this game has, but at least it included Tag Battle, VS Tag Battle, and Time Attack.  All the characters are included and all their moves are spot-on.  But you only get to customize the color of their costumes.But hey, the developers needed the room to squeeze in the computer animated Tekken movie Blood Vengeance--in 3D!  Cuz there's no way you can just rip it onto your SD card, or stream it through your 3DS via Netflix or Hulu, or even view it online with the Nintendo Zone net browser.  Oh, and you barely notice the 3D unless the subjects are really close.So in closing, I can say with a straight face that Harada-san may have won the battle against Ono-san, but has lost the handheld war.This game is rated T for Teen: Violence, Adult Language.",3,When the Iron Fist Rusts,1344297600,"08 7, 2012"

You go around beating up enemies, unlocking new powers and combos and fighting wave upon wave of bad guys until you get to the next cut scene.  Also, I don't care what anyone says, the 3D DOES NOT WORK!  I played on a high def TV with 3D capabilities, I had the game playing on my 360 and I had the glasses on and I didn't see any 3D, or feel like it was a 3D experience.

I want to see and fight HIM!  Screw the Manhunters!  No one who saw the movie is going to know who they are unless they've read the comics, (which I have for the past 3 years, blackest night rocked!), or they listen to the lame plot exposition.  I will admit the soundtrack and the voice acting are pretty good.  They at least got that right and managed to get Ryan Reynolds to do the lines for Hal Jordan.  However the actual dialogue for the cut scenes left a lot to be desired.This game is at least more fun than the movie licensed Thor game.  In Green Lantern you at least have a co-op option and the constructs that you can use are lots of fun and pretty creative.  However from reading the comics, the power of the ring is limited only by its user's imagination.  Okay, so why can't I just make a construct of a computer virus and shut down all the manhunters?

However the inside places are different, web-slinging doesn't seem designed for indoors. The fighting makes up a whole lot of the game, unfortunately the fighting is so completely dull and lame. The graphics indoors look like good PS1 visuals. The cinema scenes are absolutely horrid, on PS1 they were ok, here on Gamecube they are inexcusable. Some more work should have been done to improve character models for GC and Xbox. There are more camera issues, it seems, than last time out, there's an option to use C to help out, but it doesn't much. Sometimes Spidey'll be stuck on walls or pillars. Try picking up an item with B and then walking around indoors using C. A lot of the voices are great (Bruce Campbell, Tobey Maguire, Norman Osborn-guy, Scorpion) it's nice to have some of the stars of the film. Bruce Campbell as the in-game host is spectacular. I dislike how much they strived to make Peter Parker's face look more like Mr. Maguire than the character (Sleepy blue eyes??). Characters like the vulture, thugs and Mary Jane are bad, how many times can this game say 'UGLY', or 'FREAK'? There are about 300 one-liners which helps to engage, but I disliked having to hear thugs say the exact same thing all the time. Also, the music is quite repetitive, very much like lame movie sonic wallpaper, sprawling sometimes, ambient at others, very noticeably in the wrong place at the wrong time. Overall, it sounds like Star Wars prequel music, but nothing like Danny Elfman's Spider-Man score.

This review is not for you. In any other case, please read on.TOO LITTLE. TOO LAME. TOO EXPENSIVE.Charging 66% of the original game's price for only 20% of extra content is disgustingly greedy. This is not an expansion in any sense of the word. It is an overpriced DLC - and a small one at that.Are we paying for BLIZZARD to fix their game(!) or do we need to pay as much as a premium game to get randomized dungeons in a game that was way too short to begin with?And, they are not fooling anyone, the Crusader is basically the Paladin (the most popular hero choice in D2) that was withheld and replaced with the Witch Doctor only to be the selling point of the first DLC. Does this mean we can expect the next $40 expansion to include an Assassin and then yet another $40 will give us the Druid? With these people at the helm of BLIZZARD there seems to be no low they will not stoop to.TAKING AWAY THE AUCTION HOUSE WAS A LICKISH MOVELet me make this as clear as possible: the problem was NOT the Auction House. Some people liked it, others ignored it, me, I found it a brilliant idea. In fact, I have had more fun in the Auction House than in the game itself.The problem was the drop rates of Legendaries. The entire game was designed in such a way as to ensure that it was unbeatable unless you payed real money to buy virtual gold from BLIZZARD's Gold sellers (remember all those PVPbank &#34;friend requests&#34;? guess what!). After Hell level (and especially true for Inferno) it was impossible to survive long enough without full sets of powerful Legendary items. BLIZZARD made sure to keep the drop rates of Legendaries into the infinitesimal (a single drop after a complete playthrough. If you were lucky). Even at those small drop rates, it was still very unlikely to get a Legendary with useful attributes and stats! What is the use of a +300 Intelligence Manticore when high level wizards are useless with crossbows?  Hence the need for you to keep visiting the Auction House - where the prices were always kept super-inflated. Hence the need for you to pay real money to buy millions of virtual gold.So, if they were able to milk their own customers for more money, why did they yank it out? Because, once the number of people playing the game dropped dramatically, it got too expensive for them to operate. At the same time, the class-action suits were amassing like a storm. More and more people lost great amounts of real money to Auction House &#34;glitches&#34;, mostly after selling items - and the lawsuits kept coming in, one after another.So, no, they did not do us any favors. And no one believes them when they claim to have decided to remove the Auction House because &#34;it was hurting the enjoyment of the game&#34;. They just decided to take away a major feature the original game was sold with, just to stop losing some money.You still think they &#34;listened to their customers&#34;? Please read on.WHY IS THIS GAME STILL ONLINE ONLY?After 2 years the verdict is out and it is definite: BLIZZARD cannot run enough stable servers to properly support a popular always-online game. Or they are not willing to unless they charge you a monthly fee like they do with WoW. In any case, their servers are fickle as ever, prone to loose connection at any time, in need of weekly day-long maintenance and always ready to kick you out if you leave the game to take a break longer than 5 minutes.Have you ever lost a legendary because the servers hiccuped just after it dropped, not allowing you to pickup or open anything?Have you ever had a Level-60/Paragon-50 Hardcore character die because of a usual server lag?How about having to start over an area (missing on that random spawning of a rare event), just because the servers lost it once again? Yes, I am sure you know what I am talking about.So, now that the Auction House is no more, what is the excuse for not making private/Single-player games free of any need of an online connection? None!The game takes up 15GB of our HDD. Are they going to lie to us all (like EA did with The SimCity) that it cannot run offline for private/Single-player games?THE FORCED PATCH (Loot2.0) WAS AN INSULT TO ITS CUSTOMERSWithout warning,a about two months ago, BLIZZARD forced the Loot2.0 patch on all of us. This is what this much praised by the usual company shills patch did: it made sure that every single hour you had spend on the game up to then was utterly wasted!Did you grind for hours to get Legendary items (or, even worse, did you pay real money to buy gold and then buy them from the Auction House)? Well, you wasted your time (and money). Those Legendary items were now insultingly weak, much weaker than Rare (yellow) items.Did you make endless runs of the same areas, again and again (the infamous Alkaizer grind), to bring all of your heroes up to Paragon 100? You guessed it, you wasted your time. Now Paragon levels are shared between all of your characters.Any time you sunk into the game prior to the Loot2.0-Patch was now very much wasted. So why would anyone trust BLIZZARD ever again and play any more D3? Next time they want to release their next DLC, they will not hesitate, once more, to render all of your time spend in the game totally wasted.ReplayDiablo IIorTitan Quest. They are complete games.PlayTorchlight 2. It is an honest game.Play Path of Exile.

These problems persist nearly three months after release.I just played a handful of multiplayer games, and it's a genuinely fun time, despite some really bad hit detection. For example, I got a headshot by shooting one gentleman in the stomach, but other times I'll have my crosshairs on someone's head only to miss him/her with every round, and sometimes I can shoot people from around corners. I'm not expecting it to be perfect 100% of the time, but it happens often enough that it warrants mention and scrutiny. Unlockables are fun and add some depth to gameplay, though it takes a decent amount of time to unlock things, but on the other hand, there are a ton on things to unlock. Destructible environments add realism and a ""cool"" factor, but more than that, it enables players to alter the battlefield by destroying cover and vantage points for enemy marksmen. I found out the hard way that melees from up front aren't a good idea, as all one has to do to counter and kill you is press B during the animation (which means s/he has several seconds to do so), rendering the knife wielder a victim of his own weapon. I suppose one gentleman found this out the hard as well, as I was recently offered the opportunity to experience the sadistic pleasure of turning a rival's knife on him/herself. I think that tapping B and perhaps using an analog stick to point the knife (to balance it, the developers could make the it easier to stab someone in stomach than in the neck, for example, with appropriate damage for balance) could be a way to make this mechanic a little more fair, though I'm not sure how viable it is from a development perspective. It could also be one of those things that only sounds good in theory. Also, I've had a few cases where the game froze after a round, so my screen just stayed black. In this instance it's best to go to the Home Screen and eject the disc.The single-player campaign is somewhat enjoyable for a few (and I mean a few) hours of mindless action, but like most modern FPS games, it has a generic setting with a boring story and uninspiring characters. There are collectible weapons and dog tags hidden throughout the levels as well as a score system (100 points for killing an enemy with an extra 25 if you melee or get a headshot, for example). Each level has a bronze, silver, and gold medal to earn based off your score. However, I found it bizarre that there is no bonus for playing on higher difficulties. If you want to get a gold on each level, playing on the easiest difficulty is the way to go. Another problem is that the game will delete your campaign progress. It happened to me three times now, so if you plan on completing any of that kind of stuff, you'd better clear your schedule for a few days and cram as much of as it as you can in a short timeframe, because there's no guarantee that it won't wipe your saves in a few weeks.Overall, this game has potential, as the gameplay is solid and fun, but instability and oftentimes poor hit detection mire what would otherwise be an extremely high-quality experience. EA has yet again released a game before it was ready, and they're paying the price for it, based on reviews on this site and others, though I can't say that's the cost from a financial standpoint. I realize the irony in what I'm about to say, as this game is also published by EA, but I would suggest Titanfall, as the beta was very fun and somewhat fresh. Oddly enough, the beta for Titanfall ran better than Battlefield currently does, at least in my experience.",3,As stable as your crazy ex-girlfriend,1393372800,"02 26, 2014"

Anyway this game has many more cars than the previous titles in this series, and it's the debut game for the series on the ps2 as well.  The cars have been rendered very nicely, the backgrounds are wonderfully done, and the soundtrack is alright (could've been better), but who buys a game for the soundtrack?  The physics of the cars have been engineered to be a little more realistic, and every car is unique in it's own way.  The acceleration, braking, handling, and drivetrains are all different on every car, so no two cars are alike.  GT3 is a little more difficult than GT2 in the way that you don't get as much money for winning races, you have to wash your car and change the oil as well in order to keep you car in tip top shape, unless you want to suffer the consequences.  Another great new touch to the series is the addition of F1 cars, and dirt rallys, both of them very exciting.Overall it's a great game, and a wonderful improvement to the series, my only complaint is the lack of a few cars such as Firebird, Ferarri, Lamborghini, and very few cars to choose from that are from earlier years such as the 60's, 70's, and 80's.

They all seem to be missing features that madden and other sports games have had for years, such as being able to mass substitute and flip plays with an audible.However, the interface is the real key. It's clunky, clumsy and just doesn't give you enough information to make informed choices. The worst example was not being able to find out how many draft picks I had during the draft!

Since I am a Star Wars fan, I've always wanted a game whose immersive experience reflects the ingenuity of the saga. To my dismay however, only until recently have a found a true Star Wars game that has exceeded well above my expectations. KOTOR in short is nothing but sheer brilliance. After buying, playing through, and beating this game, it is almost impossible to describe and review such an amazing experience. These are my opinions on the game:Presentation/Style: 9.5/10KOTOR is the best Star Wars game to date. Period. If your an avid fan like myself or you still enjoy a great RPG experience, KOTOR is your game. But even still if you don't meet this categories, KOTOR has something for everyone. It truly will not disappoint.Graphics: 9.5/10There tend to be minor framerate issues during the game but in no way does it significantly effect gameplay. Character models, vehicles, and environments are visually stunning and leave the player in awe.Sound Effects/Character Voices/Music: 10/10By far the best character voices in the history of video games. Music is indigenous to the Star Wars saga, while sound effects are beautifully experienced in Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound.Gameplay: 10/10The gameplay in KOTOR is heavily reliant one 2 main factors. First of which is your actions and battles when in combat. Second however is the communication aspect with several NPCs (Non-Playable Characters). What you say to these NPCs reflects how the game is played. For instance, in the beginning of the game a common man is being harassed by bounty hunters for his late payment to the crime boss Davik. When you witness this event, you have a choice. Do you pay the 200 credits he owes? Do you kill the bounty hunters? Do you let the man be killed by the bounty hunters? Do you ignore the situation, and look the other way? You have all these choices in just this one simple scenario. These dilemmas are continually encountered, and as the game progresses, the situations and options become harder to solve and decipher. By your actions, you shape your character. Doing the right thing will get you light side points. But doing the evil or sinister act, will lead you closer to the dark side. It is your power to choose which way you want to go. Playing the game and focusing you efforts towards either the light or dark side, leaves for 2 totally different experiences.Now, taking a closer look at the combat portion of KOTOR:By using all of the force powers given to you (over 40) and several various weapons (lightsaber, blaster pistol, etc), progressing through each combat sequence satisfies the player and is genuinely fun. Up to three people (out of the total 9) may make up you group. The various companions you are given include: a Wookie, Driods, Soldiers, Other Jedi, and much more.Length: 9.5/10This game takes a good 35-40 hours to beat. You will visit 7 different Star Wars planets in your journey and several ships (Ebon Hawk, etc.). Prepare to lose sleep of this game because once you begin, you won't want to stop.Story: 10/10I don't want to give anything away in focusing on the story of the game, so all I will say is this:KOTOR has the best story I've ever seen in a game.Lasting Effect: 10/10With several mini-games (swoop bike racing, Pazaak, and much more) and future downloadable content, KOTOR can be played over and over again with a different experience each time.Overall: 9.7/10This game is the best Single-Player experience out for the Xbox right now. It surely makes my list of the 10 best games of all time. Buy it right now if you haven't already, you won't be disappointed.",5,Sheer Brilliance,1059091200,"07 25, 2003"

I'm sure they put an insane amount of time and effort into this game, and they did manage to create some immersion. However, I did not care for the puzzles, and didn't feel inspired to go on. Video games work on a simple ""reward"" system. The level of difficulty should yield an equal reward. Otherwise, what's the point? Well I found with Myst that I was forced to accomplish and re-accomplish extremely large and time consuming tasks with little to no reward.In one ""age"", if u choose a wrong switch you have to go somewhere else and re-charge a battery, and to re-charge the battery you have to pump water and this whole time you're running back and fourth and back and fourth. I LOVE complex puzzles, but what I HATE is when they are spaced far apart and you have to keep running from A to B over and over, performing trial and error. I wasn't really motivated by the story, if there was one, and the bit of acting in the game was silly. The ages were completely devoid of humanity, making the ""journey"" depressing. Oh did I mention ""secret hotspots""? Yeah if you can't figure out what to do next it's because you haven't found the secret hotspot. Also the navigation is so confusing that you completely miss pathways. This is because when the curser says right or left, it sometimes actually means it's going to turn you 180 degrees. That's fine but when all the scenery looks similar, you don't know you you just turned to the right, or 180 degrees. It's a nightmare.One reviewer said their 10yr old son liked the game. Yeah right. He just thought it was fun to play on the computer. Trust me, he wasn't actually playing the game. Most intelligent adults that i've asked about this game felt that it nearly drove them mad and they got pretty angry at the game. Not because they were not smart enough, but because the game really tests your patience and most of all- doesn't give you adequate rewards for your efforts. Sometimes when you step in an elevator the door automatically closes. Then, another time, you learn that you have to close the door yourself. I don't feel like I'm playing a game, I feel like I'm just learning how the game creators try to stump us. I will not be playing Riven, or anything else by these people. Which is truly sad because the graphics in Riven look amazing. If they spent less time on complexity and size, and put more work in the story, and the drive, it could have been worth my while.

On top of that, there seems to have been a drastic change in some of the character's relationships as well as just the overall theme and tone of the story.It would be okay to me if they just introduced new characters to add-on to the previous installment of Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, but for some odd reason that didn't happen.This game is harder than the Path of Radiance, however they changed too much of the game's mechanics in this one to the point where veterans would have to learn a whole new game - and that's not very fun. In addition, the ""supposedly"" transition of the data-file from Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance was negligible. Basically your heroes' stats would only be affects if they were a maxed level unit. (a level 20 promoted unit).They attempted to balance the Weapons Triangle so fiercely that I believe they took away the uniqueness of what each class is 'intended' for. For example, they would allow ranged weapons for every class now: Swordsmen, axe-wielders, and lancers that there just seems to be an overlap against mages and archers. They made it so that every-class was basically a generic-bland.Of course I'm making a biased review because I didn't like the ending.Replay Value: 3/10.

The mechanism for controlling the units is kind of awkward, even if somewhat different than other games. You set a price on a territory to explore or a bad guy to kill and the units respond based on their character. There's no way to give specific commands to units. The game gets old really fast, the variations in strategy from one scenario to the next are negligible. It's interesting at first but gets boring very quickly.

It was the first game where I could unabashedly say it was perfect.  The graphics were beautiful, the RPG mechanics were well balanced, and the battles were fun to play.  Above all this, however, was an captivating story with the most interesting and deep NPCs I've ever encountered in an RPG.  It's a lot to live up to.  Mechanically, the sequel exceeds the original with nifty new features like the lab station and some enhanced force powers and abilities.  Storywise, the game tries valiently but falls just short of the mark.It tries really hard to differenciate itself from a typical Star Wars story, and in that in succeeds.  It's not just about ""light side"" or ""dark side"", there are many shades of grey.  Good deeds can have bad consequences, and vice versa.  It's a nice theme, and I wish it was carried a bit further.While the NPCs aren't nearly as deep as the original game, they are still more interesting then most typical RPGs.  Where the first game revealed the characters' backstories to you slowly over the course of the game through conversations, this game opts to show you cutscenes where the characters interact with each other.  This is a nice touch in some respects, but frustrating as well becauase your avatar is not present during these scenes and you can't act on the information you learn.The plot in ""The Sith Lord"" is very deep, although at times it is VERY confusing.  Most of the time, I had no idea why my character was doing what she was doing.  It was as if there was a huge amount of backstory that was never revealed.  I kept waiting for the big revelation that would explain everything, but it never came.The end of the first game was perfect.  Events were moving to a close and building up to a satisfying conclusion.  Not so with the sequel.  The end of the game comes extremely suddenly, not to mention out of nowhere.  When the closing credits blasted onto the screen, I could only stare in dumbfounded annoyance as the controller fell from my numb fingers.I'm being very critical here.

To start with you can look at it as a program in which to make cool comic book characters, with added mini-games & the other is as an actual game. If you look at this as an actual game though, you are going to be pretty disappointed.GRAPHICS/AUDIOOne of the many problems with this game that other people had was the system requirements; the minimum video card is NVIDIA GeForce 7600, which is not all together unheard of these days. So after 2 whole days of play, I have to ask ""Why?"" They don't seem to have done anything with all that graphics power. I've seen higher quality graphics on the old school Apple... Not the computer... the fruit. For a game that praises graphics as one of its' high points it is really, really cra... not good. Its to cartoon-ish & not in that ""retro"" kind of way, but in that ""we are too lazy to properly render backgrounds, so lets use the same texture map for every single surface"" kind of way"".The music is also a problem. I'm not saying its bad, but combine the music, with the sounds of powers & attacks (mine, yours, his & the bad guys), combined with the really bad voiceovers & something has to give. I ended up turning off the music completely, just so I could hear myself think. Same goes for animations, its just to busy. You end up with a huge head ache from the sensory overload. Not to mention the annoying extra animations that signify targeting, or different sort of effects you can attempt to avoid. Right along side incoming damage/healing numbers, NPC speech bubbles & system information from pretty much everyone on your screen at any point in time. Its just to much & there seems to be no way to turn it off.As a side note, I am going to give any game designers out there a free tip: NEVER EVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE USE THE COMIC BOOK SAN FONT! It is childish & hasn't been used in comics since the 1970's, it is not RETRO!I will also mention now that the HUD is truly disgusting & I hope whoever designed it got paid a lot of money to make it, because with any luck it will be his last job in computer games ever. Its all so badly designed, that it makes City of Heroes HUD look like the work of an artistic genius. The maps are blocky & poorly designed, which would only be a problem if not for the fact that the entire map is obscured by superfluous data that cannot be filtered out.The entire thing just looks really raw, childish & unrefined; heck we've pretty much solved all these problems over the years so I don't see how you could not realiz",1,Champions Online or chumps Online,1266537600,"02 19, 2010"
10157,5399,AT033BUEYOOKV,B00002ST6O,Nathan.E,"[0, 0]","Aladdin is one of the best-selling Genesis games of all time. Unlike most games that undeservedly sell ludicrous amounts of copied (I'm looking at you, Call of Duty), Aladdin actually deserves this distinction. It's a definitive masterpiece of a platform game, and everything included in its design was implemented to create one of the funnest games on the console.First things first, and probably what you'll initially notice when starting the game, is that the visuals here are outstanding, especially for the time, and it still holds up surprisingly well today. Aladdin (the game, not the character) looks as though you're playing the movie on your console. It really is that good. The color palette is constantly, unabashedly appealing, the character sprites are large, and much like the backgrounds, extensively detailed, and the enemies are all interesting and distinctive due to their aesthetic visual designs. The game looking as good as it does is in no small part to actual Disney animators that worked on the film this is based on animating the in-game sprites. This is the very first game to use this style of animation, and boy, does it show. Character movements are outstandingly fluid, small background animations fare just as well, and all-in-all, this is truly one of the best looking Genesis games you can get your hands on. Vectorman? Who's Vectorman?Now, the sheer beauty of the visuals wouldn't mean anything if there weren't a solid game backing them up. Thankfully, there absolutely is. Gameplay-wise, Aladdin can be best described as a platformer. However, it takes more than enough deviations from the established tropes of the genre to craft a memorable experience. Instead of jumping on enemies to dispatch of them, Aladdin wields a sword to slice his enemies to bits (ok, it's not THAT graphic. This is Disney, after all), or throws apples at foes, which he collects throughout the levels. Personally, I prefer the swordplay here. I mean, who wouldn't? The apples definitely have their uses, though, and become absolutely indispensable for some of the boss fights.The other main deviation the game takes from the platformer genre is in its level design. Through the use of foreground and background objects, Aladdin can search behind (or in front) of these to discover 1-ups, health pickups, gems (which are used to buy more 1-ups and continues), or more apples. This works exceedingly well, considering it adds depth, not only to the visuals, but to the actual level design and overarching gameplay. I consider this aspect (much like many other aspects of Aladdin) absolutely revolutionary for its time. This was the very first Genesis game I played, and at the time, I was so used to games that didn't have any visual depth to them, that this idea of searching behind background objects absolutely blew my mind. Like I said, it's still impressive to this day. I still think it's absolutely revolutionary.The level design, aside from the visuals and awesome swordplay, is probably the best thing about this game. It's hard to say, as so much of this game comes off as pure 16-bit gold. The levels here never overstay their welcome, and the game moves at a brisk pace. Generally, levels can take 3-5 minutes to complete if you're rushing through them, but thankfully, you'll have so much fun exploring these levels, looking for that last 1-up or partial health refill, that you can extend this time. Despite doing this, the game never, once feels as though it's dragging on. The pace feels impressively natural to the gameplay, and the levels, and visuals that accompany them, enforce this sentiment. You'll be running around the streets of Agrabah, traversing the desert, exploring dark, dank dungeons, escaping a lava avalanche (lava-lanche?) just to name a few, and these all feel appropriate from a game design perspective. Traversing the dungeon feels more like a maze level, with its branching paths and freedom of player-choice, and the escape from the lava-lanche (see? It works) is exhilirating. It's a sweaty hand, controller squeezing, heart racing experience, and it's easily the most exciting level in the game. The scrolling here is so fast, the lava looks as though you can see the heat coming right off of it, and all-in-all, every level may not be as impressive as this one, but they're certainly close. I can't stress enough how amazing these stages are.The audio here is just as outstanding as any other aspect in this game. I'd go as far to say that this is one of the best sounding games on Genesis. From the clear melodies, full bass tones, and near-perfect approximations of the music score, this is easily one of the most memorable soundtracks in all of gaming. Even the original songs stand out in the sense that they don't stand out. They feel right at home. You could have told me that these original tracks were taken straight from the film and then composed and converted to the Genesis FM Synth hardware, and I would have absolutely believed you. They actually hold their own in comparison to Disney songs. They truly are that great. The sound effects fare just as well. The voice samples are outstanding, and even put some voice samples I've heard on the SNES to shame (which, for the record, honestly isn't as surprising as you would initially think. Voice samples in Genesis games can sound absolutely superior to SNES games, if placed in the right hands).The control is nice and responsive, though the jumping physics may take a bit of time to get used to. From a stand-still, Aladdin doesn't jump nearly as far as he would from running. It's also worth noting that when changing your direction from left to right, the screen will snap to adjust to Aladdin's direction. Considering this is a Dave Perry/Doug TenNappel designed game, these aspects are almost expected  For those that are used to games like Earthworm Jim, it's not a problem. However, those that are expecting a game that controls like Super Mario World, stop it, and accept these controls for what they are. Objectively speaking, there's nothing wrong with them, and they absolutely are tight. Nothing here feels slippery, at all, and jumping, though a shallow learning curve is there, is absolutely spot-on and feels great once you know how to do it.Bonus stages are also here. There are two main bonus levels, one being a small, slot machine type game you play to earn extra lives, apples, gems and the like, and the other are stages where you get to play as Abu; Aladdin's pet monkey. The great thing about the Abu stages is that they're based on precise character placement, jumping, sword slashing (yes, even the cute monkey has a sword - awesome!), and collecting various items. These stages work well, in the sense that they enforce how tight the control really is in this game, and the animation on Abu, much like every single character in the game, is seriously astounding. For my money, this is one of the single best animated games of its generation, coming in at a close third to Earthworm Jim 1 & 2.I sincerely can't stress enough how enthralling this game is to play, as well as to look at. It really is beautiful from a visual aesthetic and technical design standpoint, and there really aren't too many games that matched its level of overall quality. This game is an all-time classic with good reason. It's one of the best games from its generation, it has that &#34;just right&#34; difficulty that many of its peers seem to be missing, and overall, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by passing it up. It's relatively cheap, and considering the quality of this game, it's an absolute steal. Buy this game, right now.

Although it has shown its highs like Need For Speed III did with Hot Pursuit and its sequel Hot Pursuit 2, there also have been some versions with absolute lowpoints as well like Need For Speed Porsche Unlimited, and other smaller versions of the game too. Although the game remains a popular favorite, there have also been times where the need to be fast and furious can also be told in the shadows of the underground racing scene. That is said with this game.Need For Speed Underground for the Playstation 2, is a game that does try to deliver into the need for being the fastest in the underworld. The game of course shows you as you try to work your way to the top by earning points to pimp up your look of your car, and the style as well from bumpers and spoilers, to faster engines and weight reductions. The game handles well in the graphics and the music as you go through several different races from sprints and circuits, to lap knockouts and the thrill of the drag racing scene too. Sadly, there are a lot of unfortunate disadvantages to this edition. One of them is the lack of courses. Even though they are all set in one big city, you will be battling the same courses more than once in each match of the game. Not only that, the controls are also a bit shallow too in some cars, where you might lose your grip and crash into an oncoming vehicle or train.All in all, Need For Speed Underground isn't a bad game, but it just could've used some more variety. Instead, I really suggest you buy its sequel Need For Speed Underground 2, or Need For Speed: Most Wanted. There are much more thrills and challenges in those editions, that this one.

So when I first read about this game and all the raving reviews, I immediately went out and got a copy for myself.The game started off pretty cool but then what came along was just frustration beyond words could describe it.Ok, the mechanism and gameplay are basically throwing in a story to a Bejewelled type of puzzle game. So you match same colour marbles and blah together. Match 3 will make them disappear and 4 or 5 together give you an extra turn. Colour marbles are mana (so to fit in the fantasy rpg theme), skulls are attack, stars are experience and coins are em...coins. Since it is an rpg, of course you need to throw in a bit of level up - especially when you have stars as experience points on the grid. Through level up you can improve your abilities a la Baulder's Gate style and also learn new spells and attack. Sounds cool eh? It is indeed. The concepts are quite cool and full of flexibility. You can even learn your enemies' spells by capturing them and research them - all done through Bejewelled puzzles. You can even train your mounts and avoid attacks when they are levelled up. Mounts give you an upper hand in certain abilities and an extra spell / attack to execute on the battle field (usually you only have 6).Everything looks quite unique a package but then the fun factor was completely destroyed by the cheating game design. The thing is the game was programmed in a way that it is almost certain that your enemies have the upper hand. Since once you destroyed certain grid with your matching, new stones or items will appear on the grid, 99.9999999% of the time the new items work to your enemies' advantage. There were so many occasions that you only have one move on the whole grid that's possible, but when you destroyed that part, the enemy suddenly has an advantageous grid that give them 10 moves in a row. There were occasions that I had a lot more HP left but suddenly because of that the enemies just annihilate you in a flash. It is so frustrating that you just want to drain your DS into the toilet.Also as mentioned you can learn your enemies' spells by capturing them. So you did all that and learnt the spell. It turns out that you need to use a lot more mana points to cast those spells as compared to your enemies. So the enemies can cast deadly spell again and again but for you, once you did it once you have to wait for another century before you can do so again. And almost certainly that once you built up the reserve for spells, the enemies will suddenly use up all moves in the current grid and drain all your mana because there are no possible moves left. You will need a good reserve of explosive words in your language to deal with such frustration.Further to train mounts you have to defeat enemies within turn time limits. However as they level up, the time became so short in each turn that you don't even have time to look at the grid itself and it is already the enemy's turn. So after certain levels, basically there is no more levelling up. And you are stuck with what you have. And sometimes the mount spell that you got requires so many mana points that it is basically useless and being there to just fill up the screen space.Storywise it is really not much of story telling but the same old fantasy style with all the creatures you can think of in mythologies. Seriously I felt more refreshing with the small side story I unlocked in Zoo Keeper than the story Puzzle Quest tried to tell.The problem is with all those frustrations you still wanted to play because you got so annoyed that you just want to try again and again to kill them.If you are up for some frustrations and swearing with a good cause, definitely get this game and you can feel very fulfilled with yourself.",3,Good concept with extremely annoying and frustrating execution,1201996800,"02 3, 2008"

ITS OVER FOR ME AND MADCATZ PRODUCTS.NOVEMBER 5, 2011.So I got the unit from the madcatz website for 220 because if you order directly from there they have an internet coupon code that gives you 10 percent off, which is awesome because you can have it shipped 2day xpress with the extra cash you save if you want to. Anyways, i am a 33 yr old gamer, and have always stayed away from the madcatz brand since the days during the n64. I bought alot of junk controls from them that forever made me stick with the oem brand of whatever system i owned since then. Needless to say I was extremely skeptical, but I knew I would just return it if I didnt like it so I said what the hell. Well, I think the wheel is worth what you pay for it, and im glad madcatz has finally made a quality product other than their competition fight sticks. It has alot of weight to it, almost all steel, has a nice feel with rubber grips and 270 degrees of rotaion. the included lap supports are very sturdy if you must play this way, and the secure clamp is also very ergonomically designed to secure the unit onto a desk which is probably the optimal way to set it up. The force feedback is extremely present and does a very good job of giving you a virtual sense of where your cars tires lie on the road. The noise the wheel makes is minimal however sometimes slightly noticeable. The pedal set does not feel as well crafted as the wheel, but you will not slip on the rubber grips and they are spaced very well. They provide good resistance although not as authentic as a real auto, but are very easy to get used to and learning the different vehicles in the game really lets you see just how functional they really are. The triptronic shifter really feels authentic and you can even feel the vibrations around the area where the shifter lies when you shift gears. Without a pedal set, the feel would just not be as immersive, and since they are included it just was the more affordable option. Ive been waiting for the black friday deal for 28 bucks on the forza 4 game but meanwhile i cannot put the demo of forza 4 down. It feels fantastic with the wheel and if youve ever played an arcade game that had a racing wheel attached to it like sega's old daytona usa, well, this feels better than that technology. It says on the box that it ""works great with forza 4"" and they are not understating that one bit. I cannot compare to a fanatec but I had to pass on that because the cheapest compatible set that is in stock available to ship is 300 plus tax n shipping and does not include a shifter or pedals. Im not saying that it's not better, the fanatec looks dope as hell, but for the price this madcatz is doing the trick.EDIT:DEC 6th 2011Black frizzle came and went and i got mii hands on Forza 4 $(27) n I also picked up Midnight Club LA Complete Edition. ($15) My opinion about the wheel hasn't changed one bit. In fact I cannot put either of these games down, especially Forza 4. Every car just changes so dynamically as you feel the simulated power of torque going to the wheels as you downshift and take a corner or even the slight grooves in the pavement that can pull you to either side of the road. It feels pretty phenomenal, for me that is. This is the first time I ever considered purchasing a wheel and thanks to Turn 10 studios for making a game that simulates car driving at a level I have never witnessed or experienced. There may be better simulation racing games for other platforms, i dont know, but for the 360 using the madcatz force feedback wheel along with forza 4 is sure to bring you hours upon hours of enjoyment. (p.s.) midnight club la rocks just as hard but it's definitely an arcade racer. It supports force feedback on this wheel and although it's  not utilized as accurately as forza 4, I would still give the force feedback and vibration support a 4.5 out of 5 on this game. Another game I tried out was Baja: Edge of Control which is also compatible with force feedback and vibration. You can feel the both functions in the game but it's not as present as in either forza 4 or midnight club. This game was meant to be played with a wheel and after having played this game with a controller for the past couple of years, i can honestly say i dont know what i was thinking. Anyway, i guess you can tell my enthusiasm. However, for 250 shipped and at my doorstep within 3 days from madcatz gameshark website, you cannot go wrong with this wheel. *You also get a full 2year warranty*Edit:Jan 6th 2012This wheel is still going strong! Ive had it for about 2 months and Forza 4 is still taking up all of my gaming time. Ive received games like Saints Row 3, Skyrim, Metal Gear Solid HD, n' Darks Souls over the holiday period but have not even ripped open the plastic to try them out (sorry Skyrim!) It's just that the total feeling of Forza 4 is truly outstanding with all the control that you get while playing with the wheel. One thing that has improved is the wheels overall flexibility. When I first began using the wheel it had some quirky stiff points at certain positions but those seem to have now kinked themselves out through use. I play about an average of 2hours when I get a chance, and although it hasn't been daily use, its been quite frequent.I hope they make an optional set of steel pedals as it would probably enhance the game that much more. Overall still a phenomenal experience and cant wait to see what they can do with the power of the next gen systems for driving simulators. PEACE!Edit:Feb 4, 2012Almost another month has flown by and Im still pleased as punched with my racing wheel. Ive noticed a few critical negative reviews about this product and decided to lay down more information on my experience. Im still rockin' Forza Motorsport 4 every time I fire up the 360. The wheel is still sturdy, still provides great feedback from the game, and only seems to have ""broken in,"" so to speak. I have learned the pedals ""touch"" and am now able to use the brake and gas more to my advantage. I recommend using some racing shoes or something with a sticky sole because the rubber padding on the pedals sticks really well to these kinds of shoes and helps with keeping you throttle and braking like a semi-pro.  I have also started to use the paddle shifters more often than using the triptronic shifter and the feedback from these shifters feels closely approximated to what I feel on my real life car. Up to now, the game is still garnishing most of my 360 playtime and probably will be until the next best 360 racing game is released. Now time to go burn some mo' RSX rubberEdit:March 26, 2012Da wheel is still alive n' kickin wings! Turn 10 upped the cap on the car level from 150 to 999 on the recent update and its a good thing because I have been playing the game so much that I have usurped the 150 mark already.There is just so much content by default in this game because of the amount of cars and how different they all handle. The steering wheel wouldn't mean much if it did not interact with the game the way it does, but fortunately it has done its job and is still providing its dose of awesomeness. Everything still works just as good as the day I plugged it in.Edit:Friday April 27, 2012I have the 5.1 dolb-digi sound turned up with Aphex Twin's ""Richard D. James"" album for driving music and the options to focus more on engine sounds enabled. The music goes perfect with Forza and pumps u up if you are into his music or something similar. The wheel is still working awesomely and have been taking turns playing Forza 4, Baja Off Road Challenge, and Midnight club L.A. I must say that the more I play Baja with the wheel, the more I think that they should sell that game with a disclaimer that says ""needs force feedback wheel to even have a chance at winning"" Its really tough, but its extremely fun especially since you are constantly turning the wheel, downshifting, hitting the e-brake to take a bank, clutching and revving to get a good start, and adjusting the damper on the springs while youre flying off a jump to land perfectly. It's alot of fun. Well, prolly be my last update for a while and will definitely post if anything bad should happen to it. Later.Edit:June 28, 2012Recently started playing Dirt 3 Complete. The game works really well with the game but Forza 4 still makes best use of the wheel in terms of simulation. After playing Dirt 3 fer a few weeks, I had to switch back to finishing all of the event lists in Forza 4. The game still impresses me especially after being able to buy and drive the most expensive cars. The addition of the Porsche has been really great and prove extremely fun to drive with the wheel. I still agree with my 5 fun factor stars.Edit:September 3, 2012I am still racking up hours on Forza 4. The wheel is still providing the same experience as when I first started using it. I also started using the ""manual w/clutch"" option in the Forza game menus to make the driving as simulated as possible. After switching to manual with clutch I finally realized that this unit seriously needs a pedal set with a clutch. I had to map the clutch to the ""A"" button on the wheel and while it works well to really enhance the simulation experience, it also shows the shortcomings of this wheel's setup.I recently saw this wheel here on amazon advertised for $179.99 and if you can get it for that price then I feel it's a fair price. If you have to pay more then it might feel like one of those purchases you curse yourself for having to pay premium because there is no one else selling this product for less.I still agree with my 5 fun factor stars, and if you can find this product in the 180 dollar range you might be able to justify this buy. It's still a solid wheel, and as this year has proved, has provided me with the best racing experience and the most control in game I have ever felt or witnessed. I can only imagine what the FANATEC setup would feel like and if you have extra to spend on the equipment then I would most probably recommend going with the other brand because it has so much more options when it comes to controlling what Forza 4 lets you control in its game.Edit:November 26, 2012.One word. Forza Horizon. Okay so that's 2 but cmon man, the game deserves it. Cant believe it was $15 on black friday from the devil store himself: microsoftstore.com. The wheel plays as charming as ever although I am getting closer and closer to buying the Fanatec setup cuz its such a bute. Anyways, still gaming with da wheel alot and Horizon works beautifully with it. Just as fantastic as Forza 4! Probably gonna be my final post since its been 1yr with this awesome little wheel, but it has undergone extensive use, been used by ppl other than myself who were really rough with it, and I thankfully have not had any problems with it. My final thoughts are this; If you have the extra cash to spend please do yourself a favor and get the Fanatec. This is not a bad wheel by any means. This wheel is currently on *special* at gamestop online for $179.99 although currently not in stock. [...] At that price point I would recommend taking a shot at it. Otherwise just save up a little bit more and get yourself the Fanatec. As I reflect on the year in review I can see how it can be called a great starter wheel and a great way to greatly enhance the Forza series games or most other great racers on your xbox.",1,"Five Fun Stars, but needs a bit of refinement for 200+ price tag (EDIT JULY 2013, IT BROKE & NO RESPONSE FROM MC 4 MY 2yr WARNTY",1321920000,"11 22, 2011"

But overtime, I stopped playing this game because I didn't get the idea of burning calories or losing weight.  When I thought of this game, I thought probably the same way as most people.  The way I excpected it to be is really just a combination of fun and excercise.  I played this game on and on.  Sure I lost 7 pounds on it.  My weight dropped from 95 to 88 pounds.  But later, I found this not in an excercising form, but just almost plain fun.  THe way I would separate the fun parts in this game and the excercising parts is about 75% fun and only 25% excercising.  That is how I felt about it overtime.  When I first got it, I thought it was like this, 45% fun and 55% excercising.  In that period of time, it was great.  But overtime, it started getting old.  This game is however nothing compared to an intense excercising game I had.  I'll talk about that later.  My weight was really high about late 2010.  It was 107 pounds!  My doctor set me up a goal and I tried my best to stick to it.  I was doing very well.  I was eating only what I should.  When I did that for about 1/2 of a month, I lost 1.5 pounds but later on, I gained 1 pound.  My weight was 106.5.  All of the things that I have said aren't with Wii Fit Plus.  Ever since I got something called EA Sports Active 2 for Christmas, I have been playing it ever since.  After just 2 days of playing, I lost 1.5 pounds from 106.5 pounds.  This game is nothing compared to Wii Fit Plus.  When I just got this game, I found out it was about 20% and 80% excercising.  Finally, it was worth it.  From this game to Wii Fit Plus.  It has pros and cons.  I'll list them below.Pros: 1.Fun, but intense  2.Seems Very Effective  3.Has Fitness Programs  4.You Can Create Your own workouts by SINGLE excercises to pick (In Wii Fit Plus you have to select groups of 3 excercises)  5.You can connect online to see your stats  6.You can create workout groups.Cons: 1.May be too intense  2. Lags Resistance Band ControlsSo, those are the pros and cons of EA Sports Active 2.For Wii Fit Plus (I am not going to list the pro and cons) there are about 4 pros I can think of and like 9 cons.Overall though, this game is really fun.  Trust me that sometimes you will feel the burn and sometimes you won't.  I suggest that you buy it, even though it is sometimes bad.  It has its good parts.  Also pick up EA Sports Active 2.

Morgan,"[0, 0]","This is a nice travel/carry case for the Nintendo 3DS gaming system, and it is among the better cases we looked at when Nintendo joined the house. We have Nintendo DS lite units, not 3DS units, so I was a little apprehensive as to whether or not they would fit properly in this case. My apprehension was unjustified.This case is roughly the size of a paperback dictionary, not tiny but not huge either, and it is of suitable size to fit in most exercise bags or even a briefcase. It has two main compartments, closed off via zippers, that make stashing the DS itself as well as game cards and power cords relatively simple. A fold-over flap with a strip of velcro closes over one of these compartments and provides additional security should the zipper be left open.One of the main compartments has a divider in it with an obvious place to store the DS unit itself. It has an elastic ribbon  with velcro on it attached that allows for securing the DS within the compartment. There is also a ribbon of elastic sewn into the compartment that is ideal for securing additional styli.The other main compartment has storage slots for game modules, up to 12 pockets in which the modules slide in easily. Though there are only 12 slots, more modules can be stored as it is easy enough to cram two into each pocket without straining the elastic. There is enough room in this compartment to store other things too, like a pair of earbuds or a power cord.All of this storage would be useless if there was insufficient padding to protect the contents. This little case has plenty of padding, in every compartment and on all of the outer walls. There's enough padding that the DS inside will survive being dropped or knocked off a table, but it's certainly not enough to protect the contents should someone step on the case. The outside of the case is constructed of a tough layer of vinyl and it appears to be stitched well, so this case should last for a long time if not deliberately mistreated.Overall, we are satisfied with this case. It meets its primary goal - protection - and it has enough storage to make it useful for travel.",5,Fine travel/storage case for Nintendo units,1339200000,"06 9, 2012"

Unfortunately, it's got a horrible aiming system for many of the guns, an idiotic save game system, and wildly varying difficulty.  And the character design for Konoko in the anime opening is 1) ugly, 2) varies within the movie itself, and 3) looks nothing like the character as drawn either on the box or the 3D polygonal Konoko.  Most of all, this game has none of the gameplay magic found in Bungie's other games, particularly Myth and Myth II.A little explanation of the problems.  The save game system is easy enough: you don't know when it's going to save, there are relatively few save points, and the save points frequently don't tie into the game world, so you'll be stuck fighting some difficult point over again if you die.  The aiming system for guns varies with the gun, but for the pistols and submachine guns, it's virtually impossible to hit anyone (thankfully, that's true of the enemies, too).  There's also almost no ammo to be found in the game world.  It's easier to lure enemies around a corner and go hand-to-hand.  More fun, too.  The difficulty level is annoying: at first, it's pathetically easy; later on, you start facing three or four enemies, some of whom appear out of nowhere while you're fighting.Frankly, Bungie bungled this game.

It will power up and play great but it has randomly flashed and rebooted to safe mode once already and has refused to start up after being properly shut down or put in standby mode more than once. Im pretty sure it will be eventually not start back up but for now it is working.Other issues Im having that are just due to laziness or not careful planning on sony's end...The new UI is sooooooo boring! No magical splash screen and intro like the PS2 or PS3. Just a black screen with a simple PS logo in the middle then later on a corny jingle that leads to a boring blue homescreen with no option to change the color or background. The new UI is also so simple and boring. Im sure they were going for simplicity but holy crap it is a step back from the XMB bar they used to have. Strictly my opinion of course but it could have easily been so much better and Im sure it will improved on later on through updates.I got the PS4 camera and I guess someone forgot to add a setting to mute the microphone on it in game. I prefer not to use Mic's for playing COD and noticed my camera was picking up my voice in the lobby. No setting anywhere to turn it off so I just unplugged it.Now for the good!

Im only giving it 3 stars though because it seems so rushed and I dont trust my unit to last very long with the small issues I have seen it do and hearing others stories online.

I am also an avid gamer who has been doing pc games since the beginning (late 80's).This product, for whatever reason, never seems to download a good installer. It is an 8.9GB download mind you, but I download ISO images and have downloaded other DLC content with no issues in the recent past. The amazon down loader app does not give any errors, in fact it says it completed ok. Problem is when you try and install, there are several CRC errors on the source media. If you ignore the error, the install will complete, but the game will either not load or lock up when you try and play it (before the actual game starts) due to the corrupted files.I have Downloaded 4 different times (much to the chagrin of Comcast ~35GB) trying to get one install to work. This was also downloading using an Ethernet cable (direct wired) to an SSD, a 3TB HD or a 250GB HD. I also used a separate machine to download, (Dell laptop on wifi this time) and its install file ALSO had CRC errors. Anti virus on/off no difference, no malware on pc's used, no loss of connectivity during download, no crazy overzealous stateful firewall blocking the data stream...Not all downloaded installs had the same files giving crc errors, so I was able to do an install from one version, copy the game folder as a backup, uninstall, reinstall with a different downloaded installer that crc errors different files, then I copy the 'good' (no crc errors) files to the destination to replace the ones that had the CRC erros during install from the previous install backup.

10160,117335,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B001JKTC9A,Sky,"[18, 24]","Wow. I'm a little hesitant to post my opinion on this one seeing as pretty much anyone that gives Uncharted 2 any less than 5 stars is getting the NO vote treatment. But just as Nathan Drake would jump in to the face of danger...so will I....I think Uncharted 2 is a really fun game, but I'm just not as wowed as the hype made me think that'd I be. I think that I had more fun withInfamous? Sure Uncharted 2 looks 100 times better than Infamous...Infamous was just, well, more fun. And if I had to compare Uncharted 2 to a more linear game, well thenDead Space, a 5-star masterpiece, is way above Uncharted 2 on the fun-O-meter.Why? Mainly it's just that the Uncharted 2 gunfights with the antagonist's mercenaries are super redundant...even more so than the repetitious gunfights with the pirates in the first one,Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. And some of these mercenaries in Uncharted 2, while 100% human, are virtually bulletproof. Not that I had much of a problem getting through them, but it was a little silly having to empty a clip into a guy--even after knocking off his bulletproof helmet--to take him down. Even more silly was hitting a guy with an RPG only to see him stand back up. The game excelled in beautiful, realistic surroundings and graphics...you never get tired of looking at this game. But some of the invincible human adversaries were just kooky.The story has Drake in search of a Mythical stone that potentially bestows great power to its holder. Of course there are others looking for the stone and its hiding place. Hence, you'll have to battle your way through obstacles, puzzles and worst of all mercenaries...hordes and hordes of mercenaries. There are even a few surprises along the way. One thing that's a little different from the first one is the climbing. Just like in the first game you'll need to navigate yourself through some treacherous territory and perform some death defying balancing acts (and you certainly won't defy death every time). But in Uncharted 2 there are a few climbs where you'd better be precise with the direction that you want Drake to jump or it's a deathly shout of yaaaaaaa as you plummet to your restart checkpoint. Man, I died like a dozen times in one of the early climbs before I realized that I couldn't move the L stick just side-to-side, diagonally or up & down....it had to be a precisely 11 o'clockish move. My bad...silly me. There are a couple of other jumps / climbs that'll have you wondering if you're doing something wrong because you'll die so much before getting through.Some areas require you to clear the enemies out before you can get through, and some you're better off just running for the exit; and the only way to figure out which way is which is by trial and error...you don't get a map. But not to worry...if the game senses that you're lost it encourages you to press up on the D-pad for a hint. There are about 100 hidden treasures that you can try to find and collect along your way marked by flashes of light.Speaking of treasures, did anyone get the Digital Trophy map from Amazon for their pre-order bonus? I did, and it's a map to only the first 6 trophies as far as I can tell. So it's either really lame or I can't figure out how to view any of the other trophies on the map other than the first 6. I get too consumed with treasure hunting anyway, so I'm glad that I just played my first playthrough without worrying about the treasures.You do get some pretty effective weapons that get you through the levels. You're allowed to carry only 2 weapons at a time: a pistol or mini-uzi like gun, or a machine gun or various shotguns and RPGs. You also get to carry up to 4 grenades. And you'll occasionally need to engage in hand-to-hand combat and stealth attacks.I played my first playthrough on Normal and found it to be very easy. I mean, there were times when I didn't even notice that two enemies were right next to me and I took 'em both out before taking hardly any damage. I should have played on Hard. One thing is for sure, playing Uncharted 2 has me yearning to play Uncharted 1 again to get trophies that only came out as an add on well after the initial game release. And I think that there's some connection where if Uncharted 2 sees that you've got an Uncharted 1 Cleared Game save you get some kind of bonus...I think?As far as the online aspects go...I've become kind of a story mode / campaigner gamer. Uncharted 2 has multiplayer and co-op modes, but the co-op mode is for missions designed exclusively for co-op...not the ability to play the story with a partner (likeResident Evil 5). So I can't say that I've given Uncharted 2's online play a fair enough chance to comment. What withModern Warfare 2coming out in a couple of weeks from the time of this writing, I'm not in much need of an online shooter right now anyway.So is Uncharted 2 a great game? YES! Should you buy it? YES! Even if you haven't played Uncharted 1? YES! YES! YES!Does Uncharted 2 set the bar for gaming? Well, maybe the graphics, the flow from cutscenes to game, and other technical aspects like that set some kind of bar, but is this the greatest game ever. I don't think that's accurate. It's very fun. And I'll probably give it another playthrough after Modern Warfare 2 and another trip through Uncharted 1. But Uncharted 2 seems to have circulated some ""greatest game ever"" Kool Aid and everyone's drinking it but me.",4,Drake 2 the Rescue!,1255996800,"10 20, 2009"

And, after three days of playing Dark Souls 2, the verdict is in: DS2 is, in fact HARDER than the original Dark Souls or Demon's Souls. And it appears to be more fun too. But, again, harder doesn't not mean 'impossible' or 'unplayable'. It only means that planning, preparation and some practice involving a lot of dying is going to be part of your gaming experience. I will add some notes at the bottom of this review for anyone thinking to try DS2 but afraid of its impossible difficulty and for anyone who started to play the game and then abandoned it in frustration.GAME SO FARTo say that I'm impressed it would be an understatement. This third Souls title was not dumbed down or simplified in any significant way it seems. My first few hours were as good an experience as my first few hours of the first Dark Souls. Play is challenging and interesting in ways that got us to love Demon's Souls and Dark Souls in the first place. It's so... Dark Souls to experience the relief and joy of finally mastering the moves and tactics to beat your first significant enemy only...  to see yourself confronted by THREE of them around the next corner. In a few words, I love it.Getting a little into details and still under first impressions, the game plays in many ways like its predecessors. Most controls will get your toon to do what you'd expect it but there are changes, some subtle, some more obvious. So, here's what I've noticed so far:- Improved graphics: it's the first thing I noticed. Everything looks sharper, the color palette is a lot richer and... a couple NPCs actually move their lips while talking but that's only on cut scenes- No frame rate issues yet but let's see how this holds true throughout the rest of the game- New menus: everything appears to be better organized. But it's different from what we were used to so it will take a while- New items, some quite interesting. One of the starting gifts would allow you to raise the difficulty level of a specific bone fire area with the corresponding increase in rewards.- Non-boss enemies stop respawning after a while so you can't farm the same ones forever- Fast travel from the beginning: can teleport to any bonfire once it's discovered or this was the case with the couple I've got to so far.- More lore revealed explicitly but not a lot more at the very start of the game.- Loose central hub concept: not quite the Demon's Souls Nexus but,so far, there's only one place to level up so it's a hub- Hybrid healing: there is one Estus in the beginning but there are other healing items that heal in different ways. I expect to find some healing miracles as well at some point.- Classes: wanderer, hunter, pyromancer and thief are gone. DS2 classes are warrior, knight, swordsman (dual wielding), bandit, cleric, sorcerer, explorer, and deprived- Attributes: resistance is gone and won't be missed. Current attribute are adaptability, vigor, endurance, vitality, attunement, strength, dexterity, intelligence, faith- Max health: decreases as you keep dying and is fully restored as you regain humanity. One of the gifts is a ring that will increase your max health points when worn, not unlike the Demon's Souls Cling ring- Humanity: you no longer need to be at a fire to regain your humanity, not unlike old Demon's Souls.I can't say much about invasions, covenants and co-op play yet because I didn't go through these yet but I will update my review once I do. I suppose everyone is busy with early progress in the game so there's not much time for messing up with other people's games yet but I'm sure this is going to change soon, probably within hours. I also have no comments on the bonus pack because I decided that I will not take advantage of it because I am after the full game experience, as hard as it may turn out to be.IF YOU DIDN'T PLAY THE ORIGINAL DARK SOULSFirst of all, don't worry about it. You do NOT need any Dark Souls experience in order to play Dark Souls 2 so... enjoy. However, if you get a hold of the old Dark Souls, give it a try because it's worth it. Try Demon's Souls too. It's a PS3 exclusive and can be had almost literally for pennies these days.Also, do not believe anyone who claims that the Souls games are impossibly hard. They are not. I mean, they are difficult but not 'impossibly' so. Yes, they are different and to me they are unlike any other games but what that means is that patience, persistence and the willingness to learn from past mistakes will take you through the game because the game will make you get better every day while, true, quickly punishing you for your mistake or for getting too self-confident.The Souls games are some of the most innovative releases in a long, long time. I don't remember being so wow'ed ever since playing Ultima II as a kid, back in the 80's (yes, I'm THAT old). My first time playing Demon's Souls after a long gaming hiatus triggered one 'aha' moment that hasn't left me as I completed it, then played it again then moved to Dark Souls when it was released and it's still there as I just started DS2 and I was still playing the old Dark Souls last night. There's so much to say about the Souls games but let me just mention some of the more innovative aspects:- You are never alone, unless you play offline. You can see shadows or outlines of random other players as they progress through their world- The 'blood stains' of players who died can hint at how they died as you can watch their last few seconds and  that can hint at how to deal with dangers ahead- You have the ability to leave messages to no one in particular that will pop up in other players worlds and it's up to you whether they are going to be helpful or misleading or just cries of frustration- Other players can come into your world uninvited and try to kill you- You can summon other willing players to help defend against invaders or beat a boss- Things that happen to you or things that you do in your world have consequences in other players' worlds and vice-versa- You can join any of several covenants which grants you some benefits and may strengthen bonds with fellow covenant members- Most lore is to be discovered through various hints during gameplay - you talk to NPCs, read weapons and armor descriptions- 'Beating' the game is only the beginning or your journey. As soon are you 'finished' the NG+ (new game plus) starts which sets you back at the the beginning but with the benefits of acquired skills and capabilities and weapons and with much tougher enemies to confront. And then there's NG++ and so forth.Add to the above a most excellent combat system that from what I see has gotten even better in DS2, the freedom to grow your character almost any way you choose, regardless of your initial class, the most impressive and detailed art displayed on landscapes, architecture, armor, weapons. And that's not all. It's not only other players coming into your game world or you visiting or invading theirs. It's also the game invading our day to day reality through the several Wiki sites and us, real world players taking organized expeditions to fight in organized tournaments or join in some predetermined role playing scenario. The possibilities are limitless and it explains why I've been playing these games for so many years already.Enjoy. And don't let the inevitable setbacks discourage you.THE BLACK ARMOR WEAPONS PACK AND THE SOUNDTRACK DISCSo far, I resisted using it because every single item in the pack should be found somewhere in the game and I'd rather find them myself. It's Okay to have this as an option but it's probably better to use it only if everything else fails, just my thoughts. I am still concerned about the pack's effect on invasions. Hopefully the early players who didn't order the Black Armor Edition or opted not to use the pack won't be at an impossible to overcome disadvantage when attacked by those equipped with the bonus items. Somehow, I thing it's going to be alright.I will add my thoughts on the soundtrack disc once I get a chance to listen to it, and it may take a while because we've been busy playing the game now :)RATINGI'm not going to go pro-reviewer style and assign scores to graphics, replay value and what not. Playing Dark Souls 2 is pure joy to me thus far and that translates into ""I love it"" which means '5 stars' and that's that._______________________________________________NOTES ON PLAYING DS2Yes, there is no 'easy mode' in DS2 but there are ways to survive even if your reflexes are not lightning fast. You will need some time and patience. So, here's what may help flattening the learning curve a little.- Your initial class matters... initially. True, you can turn into whatever you want eventually, regardless of your starting class and there is one item that helps you rearrange your stats but if you started as a Warrior or Knight and can't make any progress, try a class that can do range attacks. Sorcerer is probably the best and you can develop your required sword-wielding stats as you level up and find some decent weapons too.- Level up a little. The cost of leveling up is not that great in the beginning so if you identify some area where you can successfully deal with the enemies, clear it several times and use the souls gained to level up your favorite attribute such is INT if you go with Sorcerer.- Bookmark the Wikis. There are several very good Wiki sites dedicated to the Souls games. They will eventually map the entire game, strategies, shortcuts and all. At this time you can learn a lot by lurking at the forums and don't be afraid to ask questions. Most people there are happy to help if they can.- Get yourself the officialDark Souls II Collector's Edition Strategy Guide. It's been written by some of the better Dark Souls Youtube contributors and it's very detailed.- Search Youtube for Dark Souls II videos that show you how to develop your character, where to go and what to do. EpicNameBro, ManufacturedOpinion, Lobos Jr, A German Spy are some of my favorite stars there and they all love Dark Souls.You will find that, once you go past a sometime painful and frustrating beginning the games opens up and, while still frustrating and painful you will also begin to experience joy and pride in your accomplishments.",5,Death Won't Do Us Apart,1394496000,"03 11, 2014"

No doubt that the graphics are beautiful but the story is basically nonexistent, the whole game is just a thousand side quests- no exaggeration.  Such great potential for interaction exists but there are no characters that you develop interesting relationships with- you just make friends or make enemies and later they forget if they've even met you!  Plus, the game is either way too easy or WAY too tedious- tons of big weapons and tons of annoying and boring enemies.  The battle system is just sitting there hitting the swing button, seriously!, besides some use of magic it's like a bad baseball game.  PLUS, THE WORST is the crashing of the game, I'm far along (though I only play because I hate not finishing a game) and this thing crashes a lot.

That said, I tend to enjoy JRPGs more than most Americans, so I was surprised by how much this game bothered me.Samurai warriors: Chronicles was the first 3DS game I bought. I am usually more of a ""hardcore"" gamer, so games like Steel Diver and Pilotwings resort from the 3DS launch lineup did not appeal to me. This one looked fun. And it is somewhat fun - if you can stomach the hours of horrible story before you actually kill anything. Seriously, expect to spend at least 30 minutes listening to bad story at the start of the game before you get to do anything at all... and this trend repeats for every. single. mission. UPDATE: I was recently informed by a commenter who timed it that there is exactly seven minutes of story before you can play. It just feels like a half hour. I stand by my statement that the introduction is painfully long for a handheld.The story might not be so bothersome if they bothered to localize it into English. They have voice actors, but they are all speaking Japanese. The cutscenes contain zero action or anything exciting, so I found myself spamming the A button while doing something else for 30 (excuse me, 7) minutes waiting to be able to play the game. Seven minutes of non-playable story might be okay for a console, but it is too much for a handheld.Once you actually begin a mission, you will find some fun(ish), hack-and-slash style combat where you get to attack hordes of enemies with big swords. There is a loot and leveling system that keeps the game somewhat interesting. Except none of the items seem to make a significant difference in your gameplay. And the controls are unresponsive at best - I really never got the hang of what I was supposed to be doing with the R or A buttons. Each character has different abilities, but I have no idea what they do. Perhaps this was explained in the cutscenes that I skipped, but I doubt it.The game is very fast paced, with frequent side-missions coming up. Which brings me to my next gripe about the localization. This game is played on a system with two screens, so you are already looking at two places. The top screen is 3D, which means that there is a lot to see on that screen. But every time a character says anything (often useful tips about where you need to go next), you have to read the subtitles because the developers were too lazy (cheap) to hire a localization team. So you're looking at the top 3D screen, the bottom screen, and trying to figure out what you are supposed to do, all at the same time because you have NO IDEA what anyone is saying. I know some people do not like voice actors because they tend to sound really cheesy, but they are really required for gameplay here. I would strongly prefer some very bad voice acting to this alternative.Seriously, Koei, I cannot stress this enough: you NEED to hire English voice actors for these games! For the cutscenes it is just a bothersome nuisance, but for the gameplay I actually felt hindered because I do not speak Japanese. I know Samurai Warriors games are much more popular in Japan, and the reason seems incredibly obvious to me.Graphics: 9/10 (very nice looking 3D for a launch title, although it provides little tactical advantage like most 3D games)Gameplay: 5/10 (fun, fast-paced hack-and slash hindered by awkward controls)Story: 0/10 (it's painful. really, really painful, and WAY too long.

I love the Burnout games and had played every single Need for Speed game since the very first release. I was sure that the Need for Speed franchise could bring in the smooth realistic handling and car upgrades while the Burnout series would add in the spectacular crashes.Well what had really happened was the the handling of the cars stayed floaty and arcadish beyond all reason with all cars feeling and sounding very much the same and the crashes from burnout are few and far between due to how the mechanics of crashing a car were implemented.First, you cannot ram your opponents off the road like you could in burnout. So as a speeder you can ram cops but that's it. Worse yet cars now have a health bar, so in a bizzare fashion it is possible to ram a car in the rear over and over until the HP is exhausted and the car flips for no reason. Annoyingly enough this is what you often have to resort to because PITing a car is exceptionally hard due to how arcadish the cars feel. Ramming a car perfectly in the rear wheel and pushing it simply causes is to slide into a light drift instead of losing traction like it's supposed to. Being able to PIT cars is something that worked great in the original NFS, hell it even works every single GTA game and even in APB with all of it's physics issues. No piting a car in NFS though - no, here you have to use the road blocks etc. To me personally, the road blocks, spike strips etc actually distract from the thrill of driving - well had there been one in the first place anyway. Oh and before I forget, spike strips, road blocks etc, are nerfed to uselessness compared to most wanted. In most wanted hiting spike strips meant game over, here it means you spin out - whoop dee doo.I am having a very tough time continuing to play the game, there is just no thrill to the chase or the escape, no desire to get new cars as they all feel the same and no storyline to advance so...why play?",2,The worst of both worlds.,1291161600,"12 1, 2010"

The designers appear to be following the rule, ""do not ever, EVER allow the player to have more than five seconds of fun.""  The missions are dull and linear, often being too hard at the end of 5 minutes of boring flying from place to place, and when you fail one you have to sit there for 30 seconds while it reloads and you have to do it all over again.

Nintendo has been in the industry so long that many of us grew up with a Nintendo console in the home. Nintendo revolutioniized the gamin industry with the introduction of the Nintendo Entertainment System back in the 1980's. Bottom line Nintendo has been producing games and consoles for over 20 years and they are the seasoned vetrans of the gaming world. You can't go wrong with a company like that.Nintendo released the Gamecube in November of 2001, thats two years ago to this date. Since then sales of the ""Cube"" as some call it, or ""GC"", have fallen like a boulder. However in September 2003, Nintendo announced that they would reduce the price of the Gamecube to $100. In the first week sales doubled and just recently they annoucned that their weekly sales in October had quadroupled. Its kinda sad to see that people waited so long to purchase such an excellent console.Now with the reduced price, sales are going through the roof. Parents and yound adults are looking in the direction of Nintendo, attracted by the price cuts. Normally their glances would have left out close inspection and they would have looked at that black tower, or the giant green X. But $100 is attractive to anyone and upon closer inspection they found an excellent console that was much much much better than any other console out there.GAMESNintendo produces quality games. No human being can deny that fact, they have always released quality and visually impressive games. However, when compared to the Playstation 2, the Gamecube may seem not to have as many games, but it sure does make up for lack of games with quality. Even if a console did have a huge selection of great games, how many people out there have enought money to purchase all 99 of those so called ""great games""? Not me and I doubt anyone else is unlike me. So, by coming out with quality games, Nintendo has a few games, but nearly all of them are excellent.-Mario Cart: Double Dash!-F-Zero GX-Mario Sunshine-Star Wars Rouge Squadren Series-Mario Party series-Mario Golf-Zelda SeriesKeep in mind folks that all of the above games are exclusives, meaning that no other console out there features the game. If you want the oprotunity to buy these games, the Gamecube is the only possible solution. Most games are kid friendly, making this an excellent choice for the parent worried about their kids. I have no idea where the ""kiddie"" conontation came from. Nintendo has never been a ""kiddie"" company, and I am outraged that many folks haven't bought a Gamcube because of this.CONTROLLER-Nintendo produces the best controller on the market and also are the only company to produce a first party wireless controller; The Nintendo Wavebird.CONSOLE-The cool looking cube is visually attractive and comes in Black, Blue, and Silver. The small compact design is awsome for anyone who wishes to transport the console over to a friends or parents home. A carrying handle is permanently attached to the cube.Well thats pretty much it.

9484,183356,A2B5G0HOXSVV5N,B0050SXFKE,H. N. T.,"[3, 6]","It is very sad to see after all this time and effort AC III ended up being inferior than AC II (the first one - not even counting AC Brotherhood or Revelations).The texture and overall look of the game are very good, but the colors just seem muted and unappealing.  They went for historical realism too, so, for example, we see pigs on the streets of Boston (far fewer than there but would in fact but nice touch); but for the veterans of the series it is hard to shake the feeling that it is such an inferior and less interesting world than 15th century Italy, or the 13th century Palestine for that matter.I could never really relate to the Connor character, which I found a massive flaw when they should clearly be considering the impact of changing the Animus target.  Altair had a past, had a community he believed in, had a mission... we knew the guy.  Enzio was an improvement on that, he had a family, he had his own ambitions, and he was becoming an assassin.  Connor... we see some stuff in the game and later in of his background, but he is never even close to similarly developed and relatable.  And finally what is done with Desmond Miles in this game is just a joke, let's just say that to have been building up Desmond over so many games to go in the direction they went is just a cheat.The game is buggy and clearly unfinished and rushed out for holiday sales.  The combat has frequent clipping problems where in order to correct superimpositions between characters they teleport a few feet away from where they were.  Not only it is sloppy but it really breaks the flow of combat which depends on reasonably predictable positioning.  There are major bugs (as in restart the PS3), average bugs (they spotted you when they were on the other side of the wall), and minor bugs (their lips don't move when they make a major emotional speech in a cutscene).  Add them all up and they profoundly damage the gaming experience.  Where the combat on AC always seems to flow, on AC III we have clipping problems, camera problems, and a variety of difficulties and imperfections.  The franchise once excelled at this, but now that we have seen better on Batman Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, to see the AC series downgrade it quality instead of elevating it was just sad.The missions are often very task specific and oriented in how to approach the problem, where at previous games you could just for fun trash everyone as opposed to being stealthy; here there are many places where you just have to be stealthy and others where you just have to trash everyone.  The problem is that put together it makes no sense, they only added some stealth elements to avoid letting the game be too short (it can be finished in about 20-25 hours tops).A profoundly mediocre addition to the series which is inferior to what AC II was in nearly every way.  Also if you are hoping for more explanations and closure on the story forget about that, there is very nearly none of that (remember how exciting it was piecing together ""The Truth"" in AC II... it didn't tell you jack, but it hinted at a very interesting master design.  Yeah, forget about that).  The ending itself is so abrupt that it suggests deadline issues.We will see how the sales goes, but I think this is another series that bites the dust on a down note.",2,A mediocre game,1353024000,"11 16, 2012"

1395,46404,A1DENY4Q39HD0N,B0001X5YN4,M. Benigni,"[9, 15]","I was going to write something clever like ""One word review:  Uninstall.""  But that's not really fair, so here's what I really think.  And I should preface this by saying that I do tend to be turned off by games that are rough around the edges.  Glitchy UI etc. will frustrate me and eventually I'll stop playing - that's just me.  So having read other reviews, I probably should have known better than to take my chances with S.T.A.L.K.E.R.Anyway... There's a lot to like here but its mainly in the way of recognizing what the game is trying to be, rather than what it actually is.As far as what actually works, the sense of vulnerability in a wide-open hostile environment with LOTS of enemies and realistically fallible weapons... it's great, and probably what's earning the (undeserved?) 8/10 ""official"" ratings everywhere.  This much starts out a little frustrating, but grows on you as you catch the learning curve.  There's a real challenge here that blends action and strategy very well.But that's about all that works.  The visuals are pretty lame on my (2G, Athlon 3800, NVidia 6800-based) system because dynamic lighting is out of the question.  Anything other than static lighting yields frame rates down around 1 FPS.  (That's not a typo.)  Sound is sometimes effective, but mix and positioning are often confused, ie. is that ground cover shuffling under my feet or machine gun fire in the distance?  Who knows?The rest is really, really broken.  And I'm sure some of it works in some measure because a lot of people are toughing it out and really enjoying themselves.  And that's great.  But if there's a core story line that makes sense for the very patient, it is absolutely BURIED in content that makes no sense whatsoever.  I would write this off as bad translation/localisation, but it is not merely that the dialog is hard to comprehend.  It's also that missions begin and end (fail, more often than not) with no apparent reason.  When there is an apparent reason - ie. an NPC is completely incompetent - it's every bit as frustrating.  The PDA and especially the map are very non-intuitive to navigate. (Maybe it works, but not as I'd expect... not even the 2nd or 3rd way I'd expect.)  I could go on and on.The final deal-breaker for me was the dreaded inventory page.  The game is challenging, so you'll hate to leave valuables (namely, ammo and the weapons to deliver it) behind.  But you will be forever burdened and wondering what to keep, what you can afford to leave behind.  The inventory screen that pops up when you loot a corpse is marginally different than the standard one (not so much that you won't constantly forget) and it somehow makes the process of looting a corpse and unloading the precious bullets from his weapon and then unburdening yourself so you can actually, ahem... walk... very, very tedious (and frequently deadly.)But maybe that's OK since most other loot is useless.  Artifacts offer ""tradeoffs"" that can consistently be reduced to:  using this item will improve armor slightly but also kill you slowly.  Hmm, trick question?  And saving things for resale is also pointless since, as many have bemoaned, the game's ""economy"" is non-existent.  There are few vendors with nearly nothing of interest, and currency is mostly a non-concern.Others have complained that the faction system is broken, that the game and the NPCs do not react any differently based on your interactions with others.  I can't confirm or deny because I'm never sure who's friend or foe until the first shot has been fired.  At me.  And that's every bit as much fun as it sounds.  And then, sometimes, I'm still not sure.Sigh.  I really wanted to like this game.  I already spent the money, already wasted a weekend, and on top of all of that, it's a very cool concept.  But there's more bad than good here, plain as that.  This game didn't leave me feeling like a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. so much as a S.U...

With a quickly made game comes very disappointing results. I couldn't play the game for long, as it became a chore to want to continue.The main campaign: in all honesty, I couldn't get past the second level. Not because it was too difficult, but because I was so unwilling and un-satisfied with the story line and gameplay, I found absolutely no fun in it. It felt as though all they had to do to make a campaign was spam the hell out of zombies and enemies with guns, and BOOM your campaign is complete. I was in the slight hope that maybe if I had my friends join me, it would be more playable but that was impossible because co-op play is only available through online play.Competitive Multiplayer: This was a little easier to deal with solely because fighting against enemy players and zombies at the same time did take a bit of strategy. In reality, my competitive spirit alone kept me interested in the 4v4 play, and in a way reminded me of certain RTS games. However the controls felt difficult to use at times, and would render your ultimate strategy useless if you weren't careful.After I had made my verdict of the game, I traded it for Red Dead (which I played for about a week and forgot about).

I thought it would tide me over until Rock Band 2 and GH World Tour hit the stores but doesn't have that kind of durability. I beat the game (hard setting) in just a couple of hours, which is not such a bad thing. The bad thing is that I have no desire to go back and play it again. At least with Rocks the 80's the songs are good. I love Aeorsmith, but the majority of the songs on this thing are crap and you just play them because you have to to get to a good song. The difficulty is all over the place - you go from repetetive chords on one song, to a thousand notes all over the fret on the next. And what the fizzle is Run DMC'S King of Rock doing on this game? It's not rock and he's certainly not the king of it. As it is a rap song, not a guitar heavy rock, it's basically four or so minutes (feels like 20) of waiting for the occasional note to appear.

There are quite a few similarities between the games, however, Two Worlds clearly had a much lower budget to work with. Two Worlds is a great game and stands on its own if approached as its own game and not compared to other similar games in the genre. Actually, this is a good thing to point out. There are NOT very many games in the RPG genre that allow such an ""open world experience"" like Two Worlds, Oblivion, or Morrowind. You can just almost literally go anywhere and do almost anything you want. There is a huge world to explore.Although I've barely scratched the surface of the game and have basically just begun playing, there are quite a few interesting innovations in Two Worlds. Instead of going into too much detail here is a basic list of the really neat things I've come across so far (there will probably be more cool things for me to find as I play more).-Multiplayer (in some ways similar to Diablo's multiplayer)-NPCs do not scale in level with you (this is one thing gamers disliked about Oblivion)-Ability to merge weapons and armor to create new things-Big focus on Alchemy to create items-Pop-up tool-tips to show you how items in your inventory (or unlooted items) compare to what you have equipped-Inventory system similar to Diablo (I didn't really like Oblivion's inventory 'list' style approach)-Graphics honestly are NOT that bad for the game's release date---The textures seem to be really high quality, but character models could've used more work-the landscape visuals and atmospheric sounds are pretty well madeHowever, it is by no means a perfect game. There are only a couple of things that bug me, mainly the voice acting. Seriously! Although the game was made by a Polish software company, they could have hired English-speaking voice actors who actually knew the context in which they were speaking when reading the lines. It sounds like the voice actors were merely reading from a piece of paper, there wasn't really much emotion/feeling involved in their speech. After awhile you get used to it and look past this, but at first it is kind of hilarious. Another thing that bugs me is that the story isn't all that interesting. I mean it isn't terrible, but it didn't really seem all that well written compared to other RPGs....Overall, this is one game that has been panned by many critics and therefore WAY overlooked by most players. Considering how cheap you can find this game now, you shouldn't pass it up! It is most definitely worth you time considering what it currently costs and the fact that it really isn't a bad RPG at all!

4702,193770,A3IIBE4D1VECWC,B005THAX5Q,D. Allen,"[4, 5]","Before beginning to review this, I'd like to point out that I recall playing through a variety of versions of various Alien franchise games. From AvP on the Jaguar, all the way up to the horrible psx version of Alien Trilogy. All of them were fairly horrible with the exception of maybe the arcade beat-em-up edition of Aliens.With that said, I wasn't very excited about Aliens Colonial Marines. I knew it was going to be horrible, however, me being a huge Alien fan, I had to get it. All I can say is that I wasn't nearly as surprised as other folks. There are many things I liked about the game but I will say that what kept me from enjoying it would have been the fact that the game felt unpolished. Or a better description would be that it felt unfinished. I think with a bit of refinement this could have been really good. The game felt like it was done but all the developers had to do was put in a bit of refinement.The game is really hard to write in a good solid review. So with that said, I think I'll blurt out some random points about what I liked or didn't.Disliked:* The word ""Marines"" is excessively overused. Right from the get go, the word ""Marines"" is used literally in every sentence. And it isn't like a casual ""marines"" mentioning like a proud marine, but they emphasize it to go ""MA"", slight pause, ""RINES.""* Clipping issues with the world. Some exciting parts of the game are ruined due to what I think are clipping issues. For example, one part I recall you're walking in and you're tracking these Aliens and suddenly, one goes underneath the ground and all you see running after you is a tail stuck out the ground. You can't kill it because it's underground, yet it can kill you.* Hitboxes appear ""off."" Especially distance shots do not appear to work very well. Also, when someone is hiding, even if their heads are exposed, it doesn't appear to register the shot very well. There are times where you can unload an entire magazine of pulse rifle on something standing next to you and nothing will happen.* You level up to gain weapons. The game has a way to gain new weapons through leveling. It's very similar to perhaps Call of Duty. None of the upgrades are actually useful and all of the weapons appear rather horrible compared to the bread and butter M41A Pulse Rifle, Shotgun, and whatever handgun.* Explosion effects are not really that useful. Again this goes with the hitbox issue but it appears using the grenade is not very useful.* AI is horrible. The alien AI is horrible but also your teammate AI is horrible. Your teammate could literally be standing next to an enemy and nothing will happen. The aliens appear to only attack you and not your teammates. So your teammates could be rushing in or walking casually around the room and absolutely nothing will happen to him. You would think developers would have this right considering that all the Aliens did in the movie was continuously come after the main characters and you just blast them.* The graphics in the demo is vastly better than the graphics in this game. While it appears the gameworld is complete, the small effects like broken windows, smoke, etc do not appear in the final version. The demo however appeared to have much better effects. What I understand is that Gearbox hired many developers to finish the game and with that in mind, I think someplace the better version just didn't get complete and they just shipped it out with an older build of the game.* Story is horrendous. The game takes place after the events of the Alien trilogy so that means Ripley is dead, and the last of the alien species are dead. However, this game make no sense. At the start, we see the Sulaco is still at LV426. Hicks is somehow alive too. He sent a distress call and that's where the game takes place. At the start of the game, a main character indicate that the Sulaco was over Fury 161 yet the explanation of this is later revealed in the game and it's extremely poor. There are literally thousands of alien walking around yet no explanation on how they came about. LV426 blew up yet it remained in this game as well.* The quality of the cut scene is vastly different than in game graphics. What I mean is when I first seen a cutscene, it appears like characters had dirt and cuts on them. Then in game, everyone is clean and fine. The graphics appear to load rather late in that at first the world appears very muddy then suddenly somewhat good. Still very unpolished though.* Aliens don't explode or react like they do in the movie. The acid do no appear to do anything and when hit or struck, don't ""explode"" like they did in the movie.* The Tracker is absolutely horrible. The tracker is what I was most excited about in this game. As you recall, other aliens game had the tracker on the screen overlay but this one you get a separate tracking device that you can pull out like in the movies. However it fails miserably and I don't even know how they could get this wrong. It's more of an objective locator and finding hidden things like legendary weapons and name tags. Otherwise, what appears to happen is that while there are enemies, a tacker icon will appear on the screen. This means there are enemies and if you pull the tracker out you can get a location. Now with the tracker, there might be blips on the screen but again I think the main thing is that you have to trigger an event in order to see the enemy. For example, there are parts in the game where you pull the tracker out, see that there's a blip behind a door so you get ready, door opens, blip shows it right in front but the alien doesn't appear until you entered. Essentially the tracker is useless and it most certainly didn't felt like the movie where you got this tracker and you're trying to find out what's coming at you. It didn't felt scary at all. The tacker wasn't even graphically similar to that of the movie. In the movie, each blip was fuzzy ball. In this game, the blips appear as a sharp round object. It didn't felt like the movies at all.Likes:* The world is very well imitated to the Aliens film. I felt that the world was really well built but again it's about the small refinements that I don't think they ever got around to.* Guns and gun sounds are very well designed. Again they got it right down to the movie. I never tested out any other weapon as I stuck with the pulse rifle, shotgun, and pistol. I felt they were good enough just the way it is. However, being that you can customize it with things like a silencer, I felt it gotten a tad bit silly and again not well used.* You can find Legendary Weapons and Dog tags. The game really plays well into the nostalgic elements of the films. Dog tags are nametags that you can find that has the name of a person from the film and quotes. The quotes are sometimes good. Now the legendary weapons are really fun. You get various weapons that are used by characters in the film. From Vasquez pistol and smartgun to Hick's famous shotgun. Very fun to find. Sadly some of the weapons cannot be carried throughout the game like Vasquez smart gun or Drake's flame thrower. Other like Hick's rifle appear to use completely different ammunition from the normal weapons you find even though they might be the same type.* There is a Prometheus reference in the game. Well it's no big deal anyways, but near the end there's a neat reference for those who seen the movie and understand some times about the original Alien derelict ship.That's about all I can really think of. Again I felt that if they stamped out the bugs, and polished it up a bit, this game could have been really, really good. It had everything going for it: a good fan base, some exciting level designs, but it all fell short because they just didn't polish it up before releasing. Plus the demo version appeared to be REALLY good while the final build is horrible.Overall get this purely for nostalgic reasons.

My friend and I would sit there for hours playing the darn thing, day after day, week after week.  It has the perfect learning curve.  The game kept getting harder and harder and you really had to put a lot of effort into the later levels, but you prevailed in the end if you tried hard enough and developed a good strategy.  One more important thing...it was FUN!  This game, on the other hand, is too repetitive to be fun for very long.""Zoocube"" is honestly quite enjoyable for about the first 6-8 hours of gameplay you put into it.  Matching up identical animal shapes on a cube probably doesn't sound like much but you're always trying to get better and advance to the next level.  It can be interesting in a certain sort of obsessive way for a while.  The problem is...it is extremely difficult.  I'm an experienced gamer of over 20 years and it took me an eternity to beat the game on the easiest setting.  Sure...there's a feeling of accomplishment after that, but you realize that you hardly enjoyed the game while you were playing.  There are seven levels you have to proceed through...one for each of the world's oceans.  Beating those levels unlocks an eighth bonus level (Gulf of Mexico).  Other than checking that bonus area out, the replay factor is almost nothing.Unfortunately, some game developers believe that if they make their game extremely difficult then the replay value will be high because you will never be done with it.  Perhaps there are people out there who really enjoy that.  I don't.  You can play the game on 7 different speed settings but unless you're superhuman, the higher settings are all but impossible to get through.Ultimately, the frustration factor is high with this game and you will probably end up becoming disgusted with it.  That just isn't fun.  I would recommend renting it if you can find it.  However, unless you are a die hard puzzle fanatic, don't waste your money buying it.

It does not have the interest or the will to change its fundamentally meddlesome whinges. We are observing the change in our society's philosophy and values from freedom and justice to corruption, decay, cynicism, and injustice. All of these ""values"" are artistically incorporated in one company: LUSH. LUSH is the picture of the insane person on the street, babbling to a tree, a wall, a cloud, or  a bar of solid shampoo which cannot and does not respond to its ebullitions. I plan to discuss the advantages of two-parent families, the essential role of individual and family responsibility, the need for uniform standards of civil behavior, and the primacy of the work ethic. Are you with me -- or against me? Whatever you decide, LUSH has -- not once, but several times -- been able to endorse a complete system of leadership by mobocracy without anyone stopping it. How long can that go on? As long as its postmodernist, blasphemous campaigns are kept on life support. That's why we have to pull the plug on them and deal stiffly with conceited loan sharks who force us to tailor our fulminations just to suit its directionless whims.If LUSH isn't predaceous, I don't know who is.

As Mario Brothers has already been released repeatedly on the Game boy, Super Mario Brothers 3 is the real draw.

The world map and warp whistles allow you to hop from one stage to another quickly, or you can play through the whole thing, possibly discovering things that got missed in the original.The availability of a save feature is the big draw here. The original game didn't have one, and so it was usually necessary to warp past worlds if you wanted to win the game. Now, you can take your time and enjoy the variety and fun of every stage, although you can still warp past ones you'd prefer to avoid.

The original game was a bit slower paced and slowly wrung the fright out of you with jumpy dark corridors, and haunting atmosphere, but this game just falls flat, and I'm talking about the Marine campaign. The weapons don't really pack a punch, and there are only a handful of weapons, and you only kill Xenomorphs (Aliens) and only once due you encounter a Predator. The original game really made you dread wanting to fight a Predator, and when you finally did you were scared out of your pants by it. This game just throws one at you and that's it.While the Marine campaign was the strong point in the last game it's the worst in this one. However, the Predator and Alien campaigns really shine and make you feel like those creatures. The Predator allows you to stalk humans with thermal vision, turn invisible, using your shoulder blaster and proximity mines, and witness brutal kills that will make you cringe. Watching the Predator rip off a head with it's spine attached and pet the spine in admiration is gut churning, but it's awesome and never gets old. Jumping around trees and high cliffs is a great way to stalk prey, and the distraction ability is great for isolating a Marine from a large group. Being a Predator is just so awesome and it's a shame the campaign is so short.Playing as an Alien is just as cool with fast movement, and the Xenomorphs deadly fatalities that will also make you cringe. Stabbing someone in the eye with your tail or eating their brain with your tiny mouth is nasty, but satisfying. You can crawl on walls and ceilings with the touch of a button and jumping towards enemies from afar and lashing out is awesome all the time. While these two campaigns pack a serious punch I just wish it were more cinematic instead of just kill, kill, kill. Also the environments all look the same in every campaign and this is a shame.The story really takes a back seat as well with you trying to stop Weyland from unleashing some powerful artifact or something...it's never really clear, but the story is seriously lacking despite the decent voice acting. In the Predator campaign you're just trying to recover the fallen Young Bloods' technology completely disregarding what's going on between the humans and Xenomorphs. In the Alien campaign you're freeing yourself as well as your siblings and the Matriarch.Despite the huge disappointment of the Marine campaign the game looks amazing with DirectX11 and all the features that go along with it. If you have the powerful rig to run it you will be treated with astounding visuals that really make the game pop and the creatures come to life that was only seen in the movies. The multi player is decent, but won't last too long, and I just wish the Marine campaign wasn't so boring! The previous game's campaign was just so amazing and spooky it really makes the game fall quite a bit.

11068,68816,A1G337CKP447FX,B000FQ2DTA,Dwayne J,"[154, 215]","Before I start talking about FF13, I'd like to take a moment to look back on its predecessor. For those of you who remember, FF12 had a lot of high expectations, promise, and hype. It had been the longest wait since the last numbered single-player Final Fantasy (FFX in 2001 and FF12 in 2006). During the first few weeks, many people played it, and many people (professional reviewers and ""normal"" players alike) gave it plenty of praise.And then we collectively hit the 20 hour mark and watched the game fall off a cliff. We watched as interesting plot threads dissolved into nothingness. We watched as dungeons started stretching on endlessly at a snail's pace. We watched, with horror I might add, as we collectively realized that, with the Gambits, FF12 essentially played itself.I was one of those people. I had written an early review of FF12 just a week after the game came out, about 20 hours in. And I had given the game endless praise. 9.5 out of 10 I said. 40 hours later, I realized that I had made a huge mistake. Consider this my formal recantation of my FF12 review. (Not to be confused with the informal recantations I'd been giving in the last four years.)To make up for that, I promised myself I wouldn't give FF13 a review until after I had finished the game, for fear of making the same mistake, for fear of playing the game for 20 hours and giving it endless praise only to watch the game fall apart afterwards and force me to eat my words again.So that's what I've been doing these last 3 weeks. Playing FF13 for the right to review it. And now let's see where it takes us...SOUNDTRACKLet's start with the easy stuff. I agree with the Uematsu fanboys on this one. Final Fantasy music just hasn't been good since Uematsu became less involved. And FF13 is no exception. It's almost like the composer of FF13 (Masashi Hamauzu for those who care) was afraid of making his music actually good, afraid to make it anything more than ambient background noise for fear of people actually noticing that, yes, there is in fact music in this game. (To be fair, it's a problem that plagues most modern video games.)There are two tests for video game music. The first test is if a piece makes you want to pause the game and just listen to the music for a moment. FF13 fails in this regard. Most of the pieces are just not very memorable, and very few of them stand out. Sure, there are a few gems. But a few gems in an otherwise bland and flavorless soundtrack does not make for a good video game soundtrack.The second test, of course, is if a few years from now, listening to the soundtrack will make me reminisce about the game and make me want to play it again. Unfortunately, I don't have a time machine, and my promise for not reviewing the game until I finish doesn't apply to waiting a few years for nostalgia to kick in. (That, and this only works if I have fond memories of the game to begin with.)GRAPHICSIf you were to tell me FF13 has good graphics, I would probably believe you. If you were to tell me FF13 has bad graphics, I would probably believe you too. To be fair, I haven't bothered looking at FF13 screenshots side-by-side with FF12's, so I don't know how much better it actually is. If it weren't for HD technology, I don't know if these eyes could even tell the difference.What I do know is that when you play the game with its real-time rendered graphics and you hit a cutscene and see what pre-rendered graphics can do, the difference is jarring. Are FF13's graphics good? Sure. But they're obviously not good enough to make Square not load the disc with pre-rendered cutscenes.STORYLINEFF13 started off fantastically. Right from the beginning, the game puts you in the middle of the action and very quickly sets up a handful of promising character-based plot threads. The game quickly introduces you to the main characters, and then sets up the main plot thread that pulls the whole game along. And at the end of all that, you say ""Wow, that was a great opening sequence!"" And the game was only just beginning! (Footnote: This is a reference to my experiences with another J-RPG (which shall not be named), where I said, ""Wow, that was a great opening sequence! Wait, that's the end of disc 1 already?"")And then the game falls apart. I have to give FF13 credit here. It took FF12 a good 20 hours to fall apart. FF13 managed to fall apart in only 3.The problem is that FF13's storyline is incredibly slow. No, that's not the right word. ""Slow"" implies that the plot is actually going somewhere. FF13's plot went nowhere. The problem is that, after the great opening sequence, NOTHING HAPPENS. After the opening sequence, I crawled through hours of dungeons, fought dozens of battles, and sat through pointlessly boring cutscenes waiting for something to happen.But wait, you say, that's anticipation! The game is generating anticipation of the story. That's a good thing!No, anticipation is when you're wondering what's going to happen next. FF13's story is when I'm wondering if anything's going to happen at all.Some of you will be quick to point out that much of FF13's story is told through flashbacks, and it's the flashbacks that I should be paying attention to for the story. Except (with a few very rare exceptions) a story cannot be told *entirely* in flashbacks. It just doesn't work. Flashbacks are retrospective in nature, and events in flashbacks feel more like backstory and setup for the ""present"" thread rather than like something that's actually happening. In FF13, the flashbacks end up hurting the story rather than helping it. Rather than enhance the story with interesting background information or a parallel plot thread, the flashbacks make a slow, uneventful story even slower and less eventful.It wasn't until the 20 hour mark when something finally happened. I remember this because when you're playing a game where nothing happens, you remember when something finally happens. Unfortunately, my joy was short-lived. A few minutes later, the game brings you back to hours of nothingness.Sure, from then on stuff started to happen. But it didn't help. The events in the story (if it can be called that) don't pull you along, but rather come out of nowhere and go nowhere. Rather than being driven, the story wanders. Literally wanders. Over 90% of the story is your party wandering around with no real purpose.And all those character-based plot threads that were that were set up in the opening sequence? None of them are developed in any way, and most of them are unceremoniously dropped on the floor. The one character-based thread that is finally revisited was then immediately ended with a young boy crying to his nearest mother-figure. Literally. It's almost as though the writers just wanted to end that particular plot thread because they felt it would distract us from the main plot thread. But it's like Chehkov said. If you hang a gun on the wall in the first act, then by the end of the third act the gun needs to be fired. If the writers had no intention of developing and properly concluding those character-based plot threads, why include them at all?In fact, I daresay FF13 has the worst storyline ever of any FF game I've played. Even FF1, whose storyline consisted entirely of a series of loosely connected quests, had a better story than FF13. Mainly because a series of loosely connected quests is *something*. Even FFTA, whose story is hated by pretty much every Final Fantasy fan in existence, had a better story than FF13. Because in FFTA stuff happens. In FF13, NOTHING HAPPENS. You know how they say Seinfeld is a show about nothing? No, Seinfeld is about something. FF13 is about NOTHING AT ALL. And unless that particular something is like stabbing yourself in the face, as far as stories go, something is always better than nothing.And what's up with the names? Characters named Lightning, Snow, and Hope? Regions named Cocoon and Pulse? Crystarium? And what the hell kind of names are fal'Cie and l'Cie?GAMEPLAY - COMBATSome people say FF13 has a new combat system that's more action-oriented. It's not. It's just a minor variation on ATB. Hell, they still call them ATB Gauges. Yes, it is a lot more fast-paced than the ATB of your SNES/Super Famicom and PS1 days. But FFX-2 was even faster-paced, and FFX-2 was straight up ATB. To be fair, in FFX-2 you had to control three party members, but in FF13, you only control one. If they made you control all three party members, FF13's combat may have turned into an exercise in insanity.Speaking of which, in FF13 you only control the party leader. The other two members of your active party are controlled by an AI script. Except that 99% of the time, the correct thing to do with the party leader is to select Auto-Battle and let the AI pick the moves. So really, the AI ends up doing everything. Remember FF12? Remember how people complained that the Gambits basically put the game on auto-pilot and was very non-interactive? Yeah, as it turns out, since you can't customize the AI, FF13 is even more automated. (At least it hides it well.)The game designers did try to add an extra dimension to the game with Roles and Paradigms. Except that Roles are just character classes, and Paradigms are just the Roles your party is currently using. Nothing new here. Sure, you can change Paradigms mid-battle (called a ""Paradigm Shift"", apparently), but changing character classes is as old as the original NES FF3, and changing character classes mid-battle is as old as FFX-2. So really, Paradigm Shifts are nothing new either.But I've always said that innovation is overrated, that good execution trumps good concept. So rather than debating whether Roles and Paradigms are innovative (they aren't), let's talk about what they add to the gameplay. Before Paradigm Shifts, if you need to attack, you press attack over and over again. If you need to heal, you cast heal over and over again. In FF13 with Paradigm Shifts, if you need to attack, you instead switch to the offensive Paradigm and press Auto-Battle over and over again and watch as the AI picks offensive skills for you. If you need to heal, you switch to the healing Paradigm and press Auto-Battle over and over again and watch as the AI picks healing spells and heals your party for you. Hmmm... I'm trying to see the difference here. (Other than the superficial difference.)And then there's the Chain Gauge. Basically as you attack an enemy, you increase the Chain Gauge. When it's full, the enemy becomes Staggered and takes much more damage than before. I imagine they designed this also to add an extra dimension to the combat. Except that it didn't. Actually, it did the opposite. Rather than making battles more varied and more interesting, it made them all play the same. Every boss fight pretty much requires the same strategy. You focus-fire on them until they become Staggered, at which point their defenses drop and you can actually damage them. Compare to Chrono Trigger and FFX for examples of boss fights that have a variety of strategies *without* resorting to a gimmick like the Chain Gauge.Fortunately (or unfortunately), FF13's combat is the least offensive part of its gameplay. It's just more of the same. Straight up J-RPG combat has become stagnant, and it's really difficult to change things up without venturing into Action RPG or Strategy RPG territory. (I can name exactly zero games that have managed to pull this off successfully.)GAMEPLAY - CHARACTER GROWTHWhoever invented the Sphere Grid in FFX must have thought they came up with the best thing since sliced chocobo. (""Sliced chocobo""... that sounds so awful and morbid.) After all, FF12's License Board is just a variant on Sphere Grid, and similarly, FF13's Crystarium is also just a variant on Sphere Grid. Who can blame them? Linear stat growth is just so cliche now.FF13's Crystarium is essentially instead of one Sphere Grid, each character has multiple Sphere Grids, one for each Role they have. This means you can either focus on one Role and specialize in it, or you can spread your Crystal Points around and level up each Role evenly and become a jack-of-all-trades. Basically, character customizability and multiple strategies.Or at least that's what the game promised.In actuality, the Crystarium is very limited. As you fight battles, one of the Roles on a character will fill up, and you'll be forced, whether you like it or not, to start spending Crystal Points on a different Role. (Or you could just save up those points, but as it turns out, it doesn't really matter.) Apparently, the game is tuned just so that right when you fill up all of your Crystariums, you get to a boss fight, and beating that boss expands your Crystarium. So unless you're skipping battles all the time, what actually happens is that you'll end up leveling up all your Roles evenly (and fully) anyway, just because of the way the game is structured.Not only that, but the combat with its Paradigm Shifts make you *want to* level up in every available Role. A character who can only apply buffs or a character who can only heal is too inflexible to survive in combat. In order to get through battles without tearing your hair out, you'll need to use multiple Roles per character. And so, single Role characters simply do not work. (Although there's probably already a single Role challenge out there already.)At about the 30 hour mark, the Crystarium opens up dramatically, and all Roles become available to all characters. So now, you would expect that the promise of choosing your Roles and customizing your characters to be fulfilled. Except as it turns out, non-starting Roles are so prohibitively expensive that, until near the end of the game, it's much cheaper to keep on leveling up your starting Roles. Not only that, but your characters are generally so far behind with their non-starting Roles that, ignoring highly specialized strategies, it's not worth leveling up non-starting Roles anyway.So there you have it. FF13's Crystarium promised customizable characters and failed to deliver on that promise. Even FF12's License board, for all the ridicule it endured, was more customizable than this. FF13's Crystarium only provides the illusion of choice, making you go through the motions of directing the characters' growth, only to have them end up going down the paths the game pre-determined for them.GAMEPLAY - OVERALLJ-RPGs are linear. That is a given. Anyone who knows anything about J-RPGs knows that they are linear. Complaining about a J-RPG being linear is like complaining that a cupcake is smaller than a regular cake. (Cue relevant Penny Arcade comic.)That said, FF13 is incredibly linear even by J-RPG standards. FF13 is so linear, it makes FFX look like Oblivion by comparison.You know how people say in J-RPGs, you're essentially walking a straight line from beginning to end? Usually, they mean it metaphorically. But in FF13, you're literally walking a straight line from beginning to end.The game consists entirely of dungeon crawling. No exploration. No side quests. No towns to interact with (not in the traditional RPG sense of ""town"", anyway). It's just dungeon crawling. And the dungeons themselves are linear. They are straight line paths from beginning to end, the only branches being obvious alcoves with items for you to grab. Those don't count as branches anyway.To be fair, this gets better at around the 30 hour mark. You get to a region that you can actually explore. You get some side quests to do.Alas, the region is full of monsters that are way too powerful for you to handle until the end of the game. (And because of the way the Crystarium is structured, you *can't* become powerful enough to handle them until the end of the game.) And all of the side quests are monster hunts, which this particular gamer finds particularly boring. And still no towns.But my biggest gripe is that the dungeons are just too long and drawn out. In general, I don't have a problem with long dungeons. But having long dungeons at the expense of an already slow story, making me crawl through a seemingly endless dungeon when I'm already waiting for something to happen, is just asking for complete and utter boredom. And it takes *hours* to crawl through these dungeons. There's no good reason for a dungeon crawl to take that long.It's a common problem among modern games. Game designers try drag out their games to take as long as possible, focusing on hour counts instead of actual entertainment. (It doesn't help that many vocal game critics cite low hour counts as a flaw for some games.) And since FF13's game designers realized they didn't have enough story to fill out a 60 hour game, they compensated by making the dungeons drag on forever.Older games don't seem to have this problem. If FF13 had been made in 1991, it would have been less than 20 hours long and *still* would have had all the same content. And I wouldn't have complained.CONCLUSIONFF13 bored me to tears. About halfway through, I started looking forward to the end of the game, hoping beyond hope that the game would be over soon. Not because I wanted to know how the story ended but because I wanted FF13 to finally be over so I could do something I actually enjoyed. (Like write a review that thoroughly trashes every aspect of FF13.)Only my promise to finish the game kept me going. Because really, none of you FF fanboys would accept my review of FF13 as a bad game unless I had actually finished the game.That, and I didn't want to break my streak of having finished every numbered single-player Final Fantasy game. (It was the same reason I went back and finished FF8.)Let me make this perfectly clear: FF13 is a bad game. And I don't just mean ""bad for a FF game"". I mean BAD. The music is bland, the combat is uninteresting, the character growth system is a failure, the story is too slow, and the dungeons are too long. (And my spoon is too big.) The game is terrible in pretty much every way by any reasonable standard for games in general.Still, FF13 was merely boring. It could be worse. At least they didn't make me actively hate the game. At least they didn't make it a grindfest. At least they didn't make the computer opponent cheat. (Oh wait, the final boss cheats, what with him having a skill that can randomly and instantly kill your entire party without warning.)",1,one word: Boring,1269820800,"03 29, 2010"

With that being said I don't think just because its alittle hard to see the items that the games deserves a 2 star rating.  I actually like this game for the DS.  I purchased it for the PC long before it came available for the DS.

Plus, there was only one game mode (at least with the Palm version).Bejeweled Twist has many significant improvements that make the original game concept a lot more fun.First, and most important is that you now rotate groups of jewels to create matches. The jewels are rotated clockwise only, in groups of four. This change gives you more ability to develop a strategy than the original game, which just allowed you to swap two jewels at a time(at least with the Palm version).The ""twist"" concept also gave the game designers the freedom to create a number of different game modes, so Bejeweled Twist offers something for everyone.The Classic Mode is a lot of fun because it becomes more challenging at each successive level and ends when your skill and luck run out.Challenge Mode may appeal to people who like solving puzzles, allowing you to unlock new challenges as you progress.In Zen Mode, you can zone out and make endless matches, sort-of the electronic equivalent of popping bubble wrap.If you thrive on playing under a time constraint, there is a five-minute Blitz Mode.The graphics are very snappy, and the game runs on Vista(Home Premium)without a hitch.If you liked the original Bejeweled, you'll have a blast with Bejeweled Twist.",4,More fun than the original,1230336000,"12 27, 2008"

Garcia,"[1, 1]","After playing Remedy's amazing title Alan Wake, and hearing news of a Max Payne 3 on the horizon, I was convinced I had to go back and give the original Max Payne titles a go. Max Payne is a third person action shooter game, inspired by action and noir films, graphic novels, and, well, the 90s. The game has a compelling story, something, frankly, not seen in video games very often--the personal struggle of the game revolves around a tragic event that occurs to Payne's family towards the beginning of the game, and haunts him throughout. Max is a cop for the NYPD and is caught up in a drug war, but gets thrown in the middle when he is framed for the death of a fellow officer. These two events force Max to be a lone wolf, killing mobsters (rather than arresting them) in an attempt to get revenge for his family and put an end to the drug war. The game has very mature themes, dealing with drugs, a haunting past, and even Satanism.Reviewing this game from a modern perspective, the gameplay and graphics don't really compare with newer third person action titles such as Alan Wake, Red Dead Redemption, or Gears of War. Max Payne is basically a simple shoot 'em up, with one unique feature, bullet time. The easiest way to describe bullet time for modern players is by comparing it to Dead Eye in RDR. Basically, its a slow motion mode.Is the game worth playing, now, in 2011? For the general audience, I would say, honestly, it depends. Its a classic Xbox title, with a recognizable character in video game history. There are much better titles available now.

Unfortunately, after taking the time to read up in the Sixsense forums and test it with 15 different games ranging from RTS to FPS and RPG games I still cannot recommend it. The technology behind the Hydra is sound in concept, but it's implementation lacks the polish that could make motion gaming hit it big with PC Gaming Enthusiasts. That coupled with the Software on Razer's side has marred my experience greatly (what Sixsense has done with software and drivers is much better, more on this later). Non existent documentation for setup and configuration was a huge letdown. The average gamer that might want to try motion gaming for the first time isn't going to have an easy time getting this working well with their games. I was really excited to try this because I use both the Kinect and PlayStation Move for gaming and admittedly they are both pretty much hassle free, but I had higher hopes for the Hydra because I am a Hardcore PC Gamer at heart. A lot of people view motion gaming as a gimmick, but it's not. It's just not for everyone. As for the Hydra it's a handful in more ways than one.******************************************************************************************************************The Positive:Before I get to the negative I'd like to also add some positive feedback. The responsiveness is second to none. It truly is amazing what they have done to make true 1-1 tracking with an accuracy within  1mm and with precision tracking up to 1 degree. The buttons are very responsive. The trigger's on each controller provide a good amount of resistance that will offer most gamers a good experience. Another reviewer stated that it is extremely poor build quality, but the build quality is just fine. The cables are very solid and are reenforced with mesh material which can be annoying, but they planned for them to last. The software developer's are actively pursuing new ways to integrate the drivers and software into Steam to offer a better overall experience for the end user. I''ve also heard they are trying to make it easier to manage custom button mapping. I think it's great that out of the box they have bult in profiles for most games (make sure to use the Motion Creator Software from Sixsense for this, not what Razer offers on their website). The Cables are long enough that you really don't need to worry if you'll have a problem with reaching where you need to play from (the actual mico USB cable from the base station to the computer is a little short, but you don't need the base station centered on your desk.***The Negative:There is no documentation that helps you get past the initial hardware setup (you are shown how to plug it in and install the software with the click of a mouse). First off the software on Razer's website isn't the most recent software available. There is actually another company, Sixsense, that you'll need to deal with to get the most recent hardware profiles they call MCEs, which make the Hydra compatible with a larger list of games. Before I could even download the software I needed to register on their website and then wait for 24 hours before an administrator approved my account and gave me access to the forum downloads. Once installed most, if not all, of my games were recognized.There are different modes available which are kinda like pre-configured profiles for different controller schemes. These are mostly used for FPS games, which makes sense I guess. The only problem is that there isn't an easy way to change button mappings. You'll need to edit the code in each MCE (profile). For some people this is simple and for others this is going be a deal breaker. One really nice feature with the Sixsense ""Motion Creation"" software is that it will let you see a great pictured representation of the button mappings to help you visualize what each button will do for each game. I like the idea of MCE's that come pre-configured for most games available, but the software really needs some graphical way to more easily manipulate button mappings on the fly.My main problems with the Razer Hydra come into play under actual use. Upon launching any game the cursor is in a different part of the screen (not centered, off to one extreme side), even after supposedly calibrating the controllers. The position varies and is not consistent across all games, while other games work just fine. This makes games unplayable in some circumstances. The reason it makes them unplayable is that calibration depends very heavily on your physical positioning from the base. So if your cursor is to the extreme left then you need to physically situate your body to the right to compensate. This I think is one of the major drawbacks to motion gaming as it currently exists with the Hydra, that's why I said that the concept is sound, but it's implementation has marred my experience. I've yet to find documentation that shows how to easily re-calibrate the cursor's position while in game. Logically once calibrated it should stay consistent across whatever application is used with the acception of the button mappings which obviously need to change on a per game basis. It is however easy enough to re-calibrate/center the cursor when out of a game by just pressing the center button on your right controller when you have the Hydra controller in what you would call neutral position (centered). Another problem that is plaguing my game play is jitter. I can be holding the controller completely still and still have an excessive amount of jitter on screen which makes for a horrible experience in any game when using motion controls. Jitter makes any FPS unplayable. I've found it easy enough to just disable the motion controls and use the Hydra in dual analog mode (basically use it as a gamepad), but this defeats the purpose of owning it if you can't reliably use the motion controls.This might be a little hard for me to explain, but here goes: It acts like a mouse which is great, but in one sense it can be frustrating. I want you to try something, do this without a second monitor or on the locked sides (vertical instead of horizontal) of your monitors if you have two. First make sure your mouse cursor is on the extreme right hand side of your monitor's screen (the end of the screen). Then take your mouse and set it on the left side of your mouse pad, now move your mouse until you get to the right hand side of your mouse pad then go to the left. Notice how the mouse cursor immediately ignores the actual physical position of your mouse and the cursor will move as long as your mouse movement moves it within the constrained boundaries of your monitor. This is, shall we say, normal and has always been like this. If you ever need to you can compensate easily for this by raising your mouse and placing it further left or right. So if you are all the way left on your mouse pad and need to move the cursor further left then you just pick your mouse up and set it down further to the right on your mouse pad. When you start using the Razor Hydra; a device that uses magnetic fields to monitor the continual relative physical position of the device in 3D space, this can really be a hassle to deal with. However it is easy enough to re-calibrate in windows with the press of a button, but like I said earlier I've not found a way to do so in game.I've found that the controllers themselves are not very comfortable to hold in their neutral position. This is due mostly to how large they are in relation to my hands. When held properly (in the neutral position) it is relatively difficult to press the buttons with ease and also have your thumb in the proper position to use the analog stick. The overall button spacing makes it easy to press two buttons at once as well, which I have done a number of times. It's also very easy to confuse which controller is left and which is right because they aren't labeled clearly (I can't even tell what labeling shows if ones is right or left). I guess they are designated as ""left"" and ""right"" every time you calibrate the Hydra? Some people might find that the cables used are very rigged and get in the way as well.I was really hoping for a good experience with the Hydra. After a lot of frustration and troubleshooting I decided to just send it back and get a refund. If the unit didn't experience any jitter and the software was easier to manage in game (mainly issues with claibration) I'd give it a 4 out of 5. Out of all the reviews I've given on Amazon this is, I think, the second 1 star review I have ever given. I don't know if my unit has some defects or simply that this is the experience for anyone who uses the Hydra. This has been my first experience with Razer and if it's any indication of what I could expect with their other products then I'll stick to another manufacture of computer peripherals.",1,"sadly, not a fan at all.",1335225600,"04 24, 2012"

There are improvements in the game, graphics and otherwise. It really does look beautiful, and the special effects are in some cases, stunning. Still, I can't put my finger on why the game just does not feel like as much fun as it part 2 on the PS2. I've actually played the game for about a month now, hoping to be able to write a positive review. But truth be told, even as a fan of the series, it fells like Gundam 2, dressed up, and a little more complicated.The quick Likes:-The graphics are good. Feels like an anime.-Effects are dazzling. Explosions galore and big beam shots, lights and all.-So far, a great cross section of mobile suits to chose from.-Changed level up systems and licensing system (either you'll like or hate, lol, no in betweens on this one, I liked)-Enemy AI feels better, more aggressive, ... harder, even on lower levels.The Dislikes:-The missions are still very similar, and get monotonous.-The camera keeps trying to do the salsa in my battles and I cant see what I'm fighting-some additions complicate things a little, actually, enough so that the person I used to play 2 with, has lost interest.-The battle fields feel smaller-It seems suits no longer have the guard smash hit anymore (which was very effective against larger suits)-It doesn't seem that there has been an introduction of new giant suits to fight (so far, but there aren't many slots left to be filled in my gallery, and I see no new giants)I have not tried the online mode yet. Hopefully it can be the saving grace.Maybe it's not the game directly. Maybe it is that on PS3, I have come to expect more from games than dazzling graphics. Some games engage you... hold your attention and are hard to put down. This did not.The final verdict, If you are a fan, and you didnt already sit through Gundam 2, this one may be for you. If you have already played through 2, this one, will feel almost like you are playing a polished version of 2. A decent game in its own right.

8990,49799,A1YP5OVRYFD4W9,B0002ILS24,Johnny,"[4, 11]","Wow, if you are a fan of previous Star Fox video games (not including the horrendous ""Star Fox Adventures"" that was one of the first releases for the Gamecube) I have bad news for you...The newest addition to the series, Star Fox: Assault, is a huge disappointment.  It is horrible.  SOOOOOOO bad.  I looked forward to this game so much, and now I play it, literally had to force myself just to continue and cling to the hope that it could get better. But it never did get better.  In fact, I think it is safe to say the game goes steadily downhill after you defeat the first boss.  Well, maybe not so steady, the ""fun"" of the game completely disappears the third or fourth time you have to wander around on foot and destroy some variation of ""shield generator"".  I am not going to get too much further into that in this format though.  I want to make a list of all the reasons this game is horrible.1) of the 10 levels I played through, there were only 3 where you spent the majority of the time in your plane.  The rest of the time you spent performing tedious tasks on foot or in the ""Landmaster"" on the horribly designed ground levels.  Each time you are on foot you start with one of the crappiest guns I have ever used in a video game.  It cannot kill anything in one shot, has a painfully slow rate of fire, and an even slower charge up time (the enemies that only take damage from charged shots fire at a much faster rate).  This could be solved by a handful of things.  A) if the controls allowed you to dodge, charge your gun and aim at the same time.  Most console shooters incorporate a 2-stick control system (like that in Halo or Timesplitters).  If you want 2-stick control in this game, you have to adjust to wacked out control in your plane.  By wacked out I mean it makes you control the plane with one stick and the camera with the other.  This is just stupid.  The one stick control leads to several control problems.  I'll get to that in a minute.  B) easily obtained weapon upgrades.  Not only are new guns (machine gun, grenades etc.) scarce, but once you find one, they have limited ammunition.  AND switching between them is a pain (using c-stick to change weapons!?!?).  It also annoyed me that you do not get to hold onto your guns from level to level.  The design of the foot levels is almost too bad to describe with words.  Everything is camoflauged.  It is very difficult to distinguish enemies, doors and important items from the surrounding area.  enemies aren't too bad in this case, because they show up on your radar.  But you are not given a map to any of these levels, so finding doors, and knowing where to go next is a huge pain in the ass.  AND as if the ground levels could get any worse, the developers some how managed to ruin the ""Landmaster"".  The ""Landmaster"" is a tank that was introduced in Star Fox 64.  It offered a nice change of pace in that game, requiring quick side to side movement and well planned hops to clear obstacles.  In this game not only is the ""Landmaster"" lethargic (it was very fast on the 64), but the hovering and rolling abilities are rarely needed (the dodging that required these moves in the 64 game is what made the landmaster fun).  There is really no need to have the Landmaster in this game.  This is the last thing I will say about the ground levels.  While you are running around on foot with your crappy gun, with the rest of the Star Fox team flying around above you, they STILL request back up from you.  They expect that you will be able to land multiple shots on multiple enemies at great distance while dealing with the phantom enemies that appear out of nowhere on the ground.  This requires you to go into ""aim mode"", you cannot move while you are aiming, lead one of the 3-5 enemies tailing your friend, and land at least several shots from your pistol on each one within approximately 60 seconds of the original distress signal.  After scrambling (and failing miserably) the first time this happened, I decided to let my team mates ""die"", because unlike in the other games, where you were punished for this and your team mates actually made a difference, your team mates never appear to do anything helpful in this game and return for the next mission no matter what.2)  The Controls are horrible.  I touched on this a little in the previous gripe.  But I still can't believe just how bad they are.  You cannot assign the buttons however you want to.  You have 3-schemes  to choose from.  One is good for the plane, but horrible for the foot/Landmaster portions of the game.  The second one is good for the foot and landmaster portions, but is terrible for the plane portions.  The third one is horrible for everything... I really don't know why they included it, it is needlessly complicated.  The challenge of a game should not be adjusting to the control scheme.  They could have saved all of this trouble and restricted the game play to the plane... I think everyone (myself and any respectable star fox fan) would have been just fine with that.3)  The story is poorly written.  The old star fox games did not have great stories, but they made up for this by ignoring the story element of the game.  This game tries to push the story as important, and implies relationships between various characters, which isn't a bad thing to do, it is just executed poorly in this game.  Most of the voice acting is second rate at best.  Falco turned is no longer a cocky rebel with a quick tongue, but a mellow ""surfer dude"" with an annoying attitude.  The girl fox never really proves that she serves a purpose other than weak attempts to seduce Fox.  Fox's voice switches between a Keanu Reeve's type effect where he sounds perpetually lost, and an over anxious ""I have done this a million times before I can't die I am the hero"" voice.  Which is annoying because in the SNES and 64 games he always came off as someone who is humble, but actively seeking revenge.  Oh, and Slippy is more homosexual than ever before.  All the new enemies suck too.  And I won't even get into the whole mess of a story where you team up with the ""Star Wolf"" team more often than you fight them...4)  Ok, so running around on foot sucks, driving the landmaster sucks, I would have thought they would at least salvage the Arwing portions of play.  I mean it shouldn't be too hard, there are only 3 levels that are exclusive to the Arwing.  Well... the flying sucks too.  It is slower.  You turn slower.  You can't do the useful ""turn on one side"" move to get through tight spots which makes the Arwings width a huge burden.  Whenever you ""spin"" to deflect enemy shots it makes this huge engine blast that prevents you from seeing anything happening ahead of you.  The ""rail"" portions of the level are plagued by the stage moving into your plane and enemies flying into the back of your ship (possibly the most frustrating part of the game).  The ""free"" portions are hurt by the speed of the Arwing (so sloooooooooow) and large, stationary ships cluttering up the battlefield (ally calls for help and they are on the other side of a huge ship, there is no way to get there in time, especially when your radar gives you no idea of how much distance is between the two of you).  You also start with no bombs, and do not retain the upgrades you find in the levels, as you did in the previous games.  This is very annoying in this game because the upgrades and pickups are very scarce, so you spend most of the plane levels with a crappy single laser (this sounds familiar...).  On top of all of this, the flying bosses seem recycled and old.  For example, the first boss is identical to Andross (main boss in the SNES and 64 versions).  While I'm on the topic of bosses, they are all very easy.  Not only easy to kill, but easy to figure out.  No thinking required here.5)  The radar is barely helpful.  In previous Star Fox games, radar was only used in ""free"" flight periods of the game.  When it was used though, it showed you EVERYTHING.  So you knew the direction and had an idea of the distance between yourself and friends and foes.  The area it displays now barely extends past your plane/landmaster/self.  So you have lots of colored dots lining the perimeter of your radar... this is not very helpful when an ally cries for help...6) This may sound stupid, but it annoyed me that Peppy is no longer one of the Star Fox pilots.  He has been replaced by the blue fox thing that you rescue in Star Fox Adventures.  He is still in the game, but hangs out in the Great Fox and *SPOILER* he dies.  Or at least he appeared to have killed himself at the point in the game that I stopped playing because it was killing me to see one of my favorite game franchises perverted like this.There are probably more things that I have missed.  This game is unbelievably bad.  I quit playing on what I am pretty sure is the last level because I was fed up with enemies flying into the back of my ship (in the ""rail"" portions of this game it is impossible to prevent this), and my best efforts being wasted by the stage shifting into my ship when I would turn at high speeds (it felt like the game was having to catch up to me).  I don't know why they (developers) keep tampering with this game.  Star Fox is not complicated.  Make enemies fly through in patterns, award points for shooting them down, have the stage collapse/change in front of you in time for you to get an idea of the pattern the gates will close, but quick enough so you will be forced to make choices (left or right, up or down, boost or break, flip on your side or stay flat).  It isn't hard... it isn't even that complicated.  Grounding me, Fox McCloud, leader of the Star Fox team, makes no sense at all.  The game is called STAR Fox.  Not RUN AROUND AND COLLECT STUFF Fox, or SHOOT BUGS WITH A SISSY PISTOL Fox, or LAND LOCKED DESTROYER OF FORCE FIELDS Fox.  It is STAR Fox.  STAR, like the things you find in outter space.  A game with such an obvious name should not be spent running around searching for alien spawn points.Despite the ridiculous controls, this game was still very easy, which just adds to the poor quality.  Bad story, horrible gameplay, really easy.  I will give one of the other control schemes another run tomorrow... But I doubt that will change anything.  This game sucks.  I am going to email Nintendo and complain, tell them how they are killing one of their best franchises... not really.  But it is true.  I should have known by the disgusting remixed theme song that played at the openning screen that this would be a disgusting remixed version of the first 3D game I ever played (going back to play the SNES Star Fox and remembering how its graphics were once revelutionary... wow, progress is funny).",2,SOOOO Disappointing,1112227200,"03 31, 2005"

Tilley Jr. ""goatman_1""","[4, 5]","First of all let me say that there is a large audience who loved the first Diablo and will undoubtedly love the sequal.  This review is targeted for the rest of you who may not have caught on to the craze or the hype.Like many long awaited sequals, Diablo 2 was destined to receive as much anti-hype as hype.  One of the biggest challenges Diablo 2 had to overcome was the treemendous anticipation and expectations that revolved around it.  I wasn't one of the fan's who were waiting with baited breath for the release, so I'll try to remain objective.One of the nicest things about Diablo was the cool CG scenes between chapters and at the beginning of the game.  The story was well thought out and after watching the first movie I was really hyped to play.  While not a facet of the overall game, they were impressive and worth mentioning.Another cool aspect of the game were the tons of weapons to choose from, especially with the barbarian who can use two weapons simultaneoulsy.  Unfortunately you can't leave things sitting on the ground like you could in the first Diablo.  gold and weapons go into your stash.  Once it's full anything you leave on the ground will disappear when you quit the game.Diablo 2 is entertaining, but failed to really captivate my attention to the very end.  I found the game to be unstable on my system which meets the minimum requirements, which was a constant annoyance.  It may not happen to you, but it was a contributing factor to my level of satisfaction with the game.One of my biggest complaints with the game is that it seems repetitious.  The hack and slash elements are fun, but RPG's have come a long way since the first Diablo was a hit several years ago.  There is little in the way of variety.  The same monsters are colored differently, given new names, made a little tougher and we're supposed to believe it's a new monster.  Eventually even the combat, the saving grace of the game, gets old after you wade through wave after wave of monsters that are far more irritating than threatening.The other big letdown is that they really haven't evolved the RPG aspect of the game since the first one.  Unlike other RPG's (which I'll get to in a moment) the hirelings and NPC's are static and almost worthless.  You can't interact with them, you can't change their weapons and all their really good for is taking some of the heat off your back until they are inevitably slaughtered.The game is far more interesting in multiplayer as long as your not trying to connect to battle.net.  If you're like me, however and are barely able to meet the game's minimum requirements and aren't priveleged enough to have a cable-modem, you might as well give it up.  The lag will drive you insane.All in all, Diablo 2 is a nice little distraction for a couple of days, but it is no t the best RPG or dungeon crawler on the market.  If you want a REAL RPG and not just a dungeon crawler, get one of the many fine Interplay games on the market.  Baldur's Gate 2 may be available by the time you're reading this, but you can already get Icewind Dale, Torment (which is fantastic), Baldur's Gate 1 and the expansion pack, and even the Fallout games, which may be dated but are far more entertaining than Diablo 2.",3,"Fun at first, but fails to captivate.",969321600,"09 19, 2000"

If you're a hidden object nut, you're going to be right in your element! You will be peering into a lot of scenes, and although some hidden objects will land right into your lap, others are very reluctant for you to find them. Luckily the hint mechanism revs up fast. Puzzles dispersed here and there are for the most part the usual tired old things: putting a torn letter together, matching turned down cards, uniting zodiac  figures with their proper symbols. The game is divided into chapters as Audrey, the protagonist, marches along  from scene to scene searching for her husband Patrick who has disappeared, and reading as she goes  the strange typewritten messages that flutter out of the blue. Piquancy is added to the search environments as you will have to assemble certain artifacts, such as putting the head back on a doll, popping bread into a toaster, painting over a graffiti on a door, loading a gun with bullets.The game boasts a bonus system which makes for great replay value. In each chapter you will earn points that will accumulate to unlock a bonus. The first ""trophy"" is a thermometer which will be hidden in every scene in that chapter. You poke around until you find it and when you do your cursor will morph into a hot cold detector which will flash red when you're near an object you should click on. You have to work fast, though, as the trophy will expire. Each trophy, a thermometer, a camera, a palette, a necklace and more will require you to do something different in every case, so your mind is kept busy. Each environment also contains three hidden postage stamps and if you find all 50 of them you'll unlock Unlimited Mode at the end of the adventure. Gathering various trophies helps to secure interest in the plot and keeps it moving. You are always involved in doing something!The art work in Letters  is very fine with each chapter being introduced by a stunning sepia-colored drawing and each environment rendered beautifully with pinpoint sharpness. The game is introduced  and is ended by comic book -like drawings which personally I do not care for, but that is a minor issue. The game is linear and straight forward and the strange letters, typewritten and creepy, will keep you forging ahead as the story line and the gathering of trophies will spark your interest.

My other complaint is that the controller buttons are overloaded, meaning that a lot of the button combinations have multiple uses, as a result you can easily find yourself somersaulting backwards off of a building that you were trying to climb, the open combat is pretty randomly bad to the point where i think Ubi could have substituted minigames for fights and it would have been an improvement. I think that a little more effort on refining the control scheme would have had big rewards.Don't get me wrong, the game is worth playing for the scenery alone but another 6 or 9 months of development and this 3 star game could have been a 5 star game.  I am sure the bean counters at EA determined that the number of additional copies a 5 star game would sell was not worth the extra development effort to perfect the game but IMO it is really a lost opportunity.",3,It could have been a great game but..,1273622400,"05 12, 2010"

The combat itself is relatively simple as far as combinations, but battles like bosses or what I would consider mid-bosses require some strategy. Overall combat isn't deep, but not mind numbing either. This game is also has a lot of puzzles. A lot of them aren't hard once you look around and figure how things work, but there's a few that'll have your head itching. Once again, if you like games like Zelda, you'll enjoy this.The graphics don't push the 360's power much, but the game has lots of color which is a nice change of pace from all the gray and brown games out there. War (you play as him), as well as the bosses, important characters to the story, and the environment look great. The enemies you'll be facing on a regular basis look okay, but miss the charm the others have.Sound and voice acting do well, though I do suggest to pump up the music volume to it's maximum or you'll never hear it (and don't worry about drowning out the sound or the voices since the music never gets that high.)It's a good game and I'm looking forward to a sequel.

From graphics/environment to gameplay, to story, this game is about as well-rounded as you will find.There would not be enough room to go into detail about all of the positive points about this game, but here are some of the top performers:Graphics: By far the top feature in my mind. Clearly this game was designed to push the limits of the PS2. The result is a series of beautiful and immersive environments. You get the feeling you are standing in ancient Greece fighting frighteningly realistic enemies. Bosses in particular stand out as master achievements in gaming graphics.Gameplay: Nothing kills a game like a difficult control scheme and nothing makes a game like a truly intuitive one. This game offers a wide array of combos that are easy to use so you'll be owning monsters like Zeus himself imbued you with special powers. In fact, in the game he does! You obtain several special powers from different Gods throughout the story. Some games leave you wanting to use the same special power all the time, but not so with this one. Each power is useful in a particular type of situation so you find yourself using each of your powers regularly, depending on the situation you face. In addition, an innovative concept I loved was the ""mini-game"" method of defeating a foe. These bits of spice really add to the excitement and go a long way to avoid the monotony of typical hack & slash games.Summary:As action games go, this one tops a lot of lists. Within the first thirty seconds you will be drawn in and you likely won't want to put the controller down until you've finished the game.

Using aggro, the main hook of the gameplay, becomes stale as you have to use it about every single firefight.  Not to mention, the aiming is terrible.

5801,123143,AP3B615GM191G,B001UU1WRE,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[7, 15]","Ever since Madden '97, I have been a devout follower of the Madden NFL football game franchise, logging more hours with those games than any other (and the margin probably isn't even that close).  One of the aspects of the games that always impressed me, though, was the franchise's ability to maintain the utmost of gaming quality when transition from system to system.  From my personal experience with the Nintendo brand, whether it was on the SNES, N64, or Gamecube, the Madden series always made a smooth transition and didn't mess with perfection.With the introduction of the Nintendo Wii system, however, the Madden games began to take a turn for the worse.  Madden '09 was the first one I played on the Wii, and for the first time in my Madden-playing history I was disappointed.  The graphics were a bit shabby, the game had a few too many glitches, and little things (like having to point and select a play, instead of just clicking a button, which allowed your opponent to guess your next move) dragged it down.However, being a Madden junkie, I purchased the newest edition, Madden 10, with hopes that it would right the previous wrongs and get the franchise back on the right track.  Sadly, however, after 15 minutes of playing time, it became perfectly clear that the game was going in a completely different direction...and not one that most hard-core Madden gamers will appreciate.There are two glaring problems I found in this game, the first (and worst) of which being the new ""improved"" graphical transition.  Basically, in keeping with the Wii's moving towards being almost exclusively a child/family gaming console, the game now looks like a cartoon.  Instead of detailed players, jerseys, fields, and game action, the players now look like animated figures who are kind of chunky.  For me, this was pretty much an unpardonable sin.  I take my Madden very seriously, and don't want to feel as if I am playing a cartoon game.  A few years ago, a game called NFL Blitz tried that approach (albeit more over-the-top), and when do you ever hear of that franchise taken seriously?The second obvious problem with the game is that Nintendo (or EA Sports, whatever the case may be) still didn't get the presentation right once again.  For example, upon first playing the game, one would think that the entire franchise mode (probably the most popular feature of the entire game) has been removed.  Only online searching for an unlockable password allows gamers to access that mode.  How asinine can the franchise get?!  I think that perhaps Nintendo was trying to promote the game's co-operative player mode, but why do so by making things more difficult for the die-hards?  Poor ""customer service"" is what it boils down to.Thus, after comparing this game with the XBox 360 game of the same name, Madden 10 for the Wii is an absolute joke.  In fact, after nearly 20 years of brand loyalty to Nintendo, I now have all my Wii hardware and software on Ebay and am transitioning to the XBox 360.  That's how turned off I was.",1,An Absolute Joke Compared To Other Systems,1251331200,"08 27, 2009"

I loved the fact that they had those things built in, but have been hesitant over the years to buy one for a proper system.You always hear stories about how these things work once or twice, then they never work again, or they corrupted game files & data, and the system never worked again ect...ect.... yawnnnn.Recently I have started to play a few DS games and I just wanted some invincibility codes and things like that, but there where no cheats for certain games to do such things.So I checked out what was available for the DS on ebay and found one of these Action Replays going cheap. I thought i'd look into it a bit first, to see what people say about it, and judging by reviews found here, It almost made me not want to purchase it. I gave in thinking that it was only a few bucks, it wouldn't scar me to at least try it.And man, am I glad I did now!!I have no idea why there are so many bad reviews for this thing, it is very easy to use, and makes gaming a lot of fun when you have decent codes.It's simple to use, all you do is stick the Action Replay into your DS, power it on, and it comes up with a screen saying this is not indorced by nintendo, blah blah blah.... then says, inert your game.So you eject the A.R, pop in your game and it says for eg: ""Mario 64 DS"" detected. Then what you do is hit a (*) icon on the screen and see what cheats you have for it. It comes with 100's of codes built into it, which you can delete later if you want, but right away there where plenty of cheats for Mario 64 DS and they worked great.Once you've selected your cheats, you hit start and begin to play the game with your codes on.Thats all there is to that.The other cool thing is it comes with a little CD to install an updater. And a little usb plug to plug into it. You just install the software, plug the cable in while the AR is in your DS and it's turned on, and it goes to an update screen on the DS.You have 3 boxes on the program, one is what codes are already on your DS, one is a saved codes file, which is all the codes already on the A.R, and then any more you choose to save there. And the 3rd box is where you get your updates. By default it only comes with updates from CodeJunkies for Pal, NTSD and Japan games.But it is as simple as doing a google search for ""Action Replay Subscriptions) and you can find plenty more to use.Newer games may not be on the action replay by default, and displays ""unknown game"" when inserted. But it's just a search from your subscriptions from that game, and just drag the file from the subs box to the A.R box, and thats it, it's on there now!As I said, it's simple to use, anyone can do it, the only thing you can't do is search for codes to make. It doesn't do the value search thing like other ones, but I never could do any of that stuff anyway, so I'm glad it's not on this.There is nothing wrong with this thing, I think some reviewers may just not be able to figure out how to work it, or how to update it and hence, it's a bad review of a device that supposedly does not work.

6216,47387,ASU3THM5ZUTUI,B000238EJ4,"Mark Lee ""Peacemaker""","[6, 6]","The Donkey Kong Country trilogy proved to be one of the most successful ones ever crafted for the SNES, and one of the top few of the 90's.  Although the port of the original DKC was faithful in its reproduction of the levels, graphics, and music, I was somewhat underwhelmed by it due to its dumbed-down difficulty level and ridiculously simple bonus games.  However, it seems as though someone had either read my review or clearly taken my prayers and pleas to heart while making the DKC2 port, because many of the previous problems have now been dealt with in a satisfactory fashion.The levels of DKC2 themselves are not harder than before in this version.  They remain generally unchanged, and along with all the original challenges, they still retain all of their charming music and graphics.  Although a hidden ostrich feather is tucked away in each level and photographs in certain others, the level layouts are the same, and there are no big surprises in any level--just the same fun you'll remember from 1995.  (Except for *one* level in particular...you'll see when you get there.)This was true of the GBA port of the original DKC also, but it was way too easy to get tons of lives in that game.  But now, while you can still save the game anywhere with the number of lives picked up thus far, it is overall much more difficult to get lives.  This is primarily because the bonus games themselves are much more difficult to play: instead of Funky's fishing game and Candy's dance game, Funky now has a flying game, and Cranky trains an ostrich that you can race.  In the GBA version of the original DKC, the games required no skill other than simple timing, and would offer huge rewards (i.e. 3 extra lives) with every win.  Now Funky requires you to navigate a rickety plane through craggy levels while fulfilling certain mission objective, and Cranky's Expresso races can prove to be as frustrating as the Chocobo races of Final Fantasy VII unless you play through the levels enough to find the hidden ostrich feathers.  Plus, the reward for winning each of these games the first time is a Hero Coin (one step closer to beating the game 100%) and you won't get anything for winning again.Wrinkly, Swanky, and Klubba also have new challenges of their own, but they put the game's Banana Coins to more use than the SNES version of DKC2 ever did.  Swanky has his original challenges that take coins to play for lives and cannot be replayed, but now he also challenges you to pay 10 coins every time you want to re-fight a boss, with a promised prize of 6 extra lives if you win--ultimately, it's a quick but very challenging and expensive way to win lives that is far superior to the overly easy Animal Bonuses of DKC.  Wrinkly offers the same advice as before, but now she has a new challenge of finding the hidden photos in the levels to fully complete the game, and each hint at the locations will cost you 10 coins.  Klubba's game, however, is the most fun addition; for 5 coins, you get to run around his swamp picking up little red flying bugs, while also dancing around and hiding in little alcoves to avoid getting ""clubbed"".  The game can prove to be hard on your fingers, and you'd need to pick up 10 bugs just to get 3 extra lives, but the rewards are much more fitting when compared to the simple timing of Candy's dance game, and the gameplay is much more complicated and fun.Even the level gameplay not part of the actual game is superior to that of the previous GBA port, which was playing through the levels to get the highest score possible; now, you have to race through the levels as quickly as possible to get the quickest time.  It was remarkably easy to get an ""S"" rank before; now, the only limits set are your own best times.And finally, the most important fix of all; the Bonus Barrels are much better hidden than before.  They were so easy to see before that they were no longer secrets; now, extra care has been taken to hide them off the screen and out of plain view.  Overall, there are many reasons to buy this game and forget that the GBA version of the original DKC ever existed.

There are more ""minibosses"" in this version with generals and chimera, but they end up being more annoying than challenging.Story: 3/10Even for a cheap franchise re-release, the graphics are pretty poor, especially on the new characters. If you've played the arcade you'll find nothing new. If you haven't, then try to be forgiving because there's not much to see.Graphics: 3/10The sounds are generally corny, but there are some good aura effects like hearing people pounding on the nailed-shut coffins in the Desecrated Temple. Voicing is pretty lame, but it faithfully reproduces (in other words regurgitates) Gauntlet Legends on the arcade and N64. Lack of independent volume leveling brings the score down to mediocre.Sound: 4/10While the music is surprisingly decent, that's probably more because it's catchy when it's there and so many of the other standards are so low. More for nostalgia than any merits of its own.Music: 6/10This game might seem a chore when going single-player, but add friends and it gets exponentially more fun - up to four players. The levels change subtly depending on how many players are there, and while there's little real depth it's still good arcadey hack-and-slash fun. Best with 2+ players. There are plenty of items and power-ups, but for some reason this version disables the ability to turn them off for better timing, or selling them, so everything ends up being almost completely useless and this seriously degrades the score.Gameplay: 6/10You can replay any level you've unlocked at will, including boss battles, but unlike the N64 version you don't get any cool abilities like permanent Anti-Death Halo for beating the final boss. While it's enjoyable spending time with friends, you'll probably only want to run through a few levels before you'll want to take a break or put in something different. It might have been better if item management had remained, but special abilities are almost useless and the long time it takes to level-up and upgrade makes this game get tedious at higher levels, with no real rewards.Replayability: 4/10There's little about this game that shines, but it is undeniable fun when played with friends. I wouldn't recommend a rent (characters are too weak at the start and options are limited), but it's not a game you should get for yourself (when I say it's best with friends, I mean it's good only with friends). Admittedly, it is good for nostalgia or if you and a few friends want an arcade fix, but it's not going to surprise you with any quality.Overall: 6.0/10",3,Co-op Returns,1267920000,"03 7, 2010"

This DS remake brings back lots of great memories on this original FE.  The SNES version back then (like 15~17 years ago) actually combined the Shadow Dragon as Ch. 1 and the other DS release (currently only available in Japanese Import version) as Ch. 2.The DS version, although seeming took away some of the classic elements in its predecessor, is still a very well made stragegy game.PROS:+ Gives FE fans who entered the series midway through the luxury to have a taste in its history and how the game evolved over time.+ Good balance between the different classes, though mages seem to play a lesser role in this version due to their extremely weak resistance to physical attack  (in other releases it wasn't as difficult to beef up your mages' defense, but in this one it's almost impossible to get their D in double digits even by means of S/L.  FE fans know what I am talking about).  Well, this makes sense afterall.+ Sound is good+ Hidden stages+ Enemies have a much fair chance of hitting in this release.  Unlike all previous releases in which ordinary enemy units have an average hit % of like 30~40%.CONS:- No cut-scenes- You basically can't keep extra recruits.  FE fans have the tendency to ""collect"" as many recruits as possible by avoiding having them defeated in battles.  Well in order to access the hidden stages you will have to sacrafice basically all but your main force.  I mean at the end you gotta keep it down to like 12 or 13 people in order to get to the very last hidden stage right before the finale.- No class-change for Mars is a disappointment.  Although this was how the original was, it'd be nice to see your main char transform at least once throughout the game, especially considering the length of this game (it could easily take 20~30+ hours).- System a little too simple for a 2010 remake.  Basically the only commands are either to attack or to heal.  They could've easily tossed in class-specific abilities as an incentive to develop weaker classes.Overall, I say this is a must have for FE fans, but players w/o the FE hype may find this title a big disappointment.",4,Nice Remake,1306454400,"05 27, 2011"

The Red scheme looks amazing along with the Mario game (I'm not really stoked about the Wii Sports, although my sister may enjoy it. Bro-in-law's more into the action though)! I have never cared enough for Nintendo since transitioning to the PS2, PS3, and PC, but I'm having the sweet nostalgia I once had with my Super Nintendo around her age and consequently, I want to go re-visit Mario, Zelda, and Samus on the Wii. Maybe next time. I believe when the Wii debuted in late 2006, it was $250 and it was only for the system itself; Late 2010 and only a $50 decrease, but this particular Red Bundle is really a win! I'm not sure if the Nunchuk was included in launch systems, but you get the Wii Remote Plus + Nunchuk, Wii Sports, Mario, and the nice Red, these sold seperately would be in the $250+ range! A Wii's a Wii, but when it's a Red Wii commemorating the 25th anniversary of Super Mario, it stands out from the rest.

MacMahon,"[3, 5]","Just Cause was a love it or hate it game in my experience because despite being so adrenaline-fueled and fun, the mission structure was flawed, the missions themselves were somewhat boring and the visuals looked old for the time due to being developed around the Playstation 2.Just Cause 2 is... much the same, really, but a lot bigger, a lot more fun and a loooooot prettier.Seriously, do you like amazing graphics?  Do you love seeing detailed worlds with great view distance and stunning lighting effects?  Do you love seeing some skyscraper in the distance and knowing you can go climb it, all the while surrounded by a sky, ground and city that stands up there with the best visuals in the medium?  Well then my friend, you will love Just Cause 2's visual splendor.  While not as accomplished as Grand Theft Auto 4 in physics and detail, Just Cause 2 is easily the best looking open world game I have ever seen, and much better looking than the average game in the genre such as The Saboteur or Assassin's Creed.  On a purely visual level, Just Cause 2 is a 10 out of 10.Gameplay wise... well, it depends on what you like about games.Just Cause 2 is a sandbox in the purest sense, it recalls the days when you might have played with G.I. Joes in the back yard and pretended you could climb tanks, shoot dozens of dudes without pausing for a breath or fly through the sky at the speed of a toddlers arm.  On a purely videogame level it reminds me of the first days of Grand Theft Auto 3, the first 3D open-world game I remember playing where you could cause mass hysteria.  In GTA3 I spent dozens of hours early on just running around causing mayhem and blowing things up, and no open-world game has given me that raw thrill since because it had been done already, the surprise was over.  Just Cause 2 brings this feeling back, the explosions and chaos (an actual game currency) are the best in the genre since that time (perhaps tied with Mercenaries, which sadly never saw a PC release).What separates Just Cause 2 from other open-world shooters other than chaos?  Well, the grappling hook and parachute for one.  You can grapple on to anything and deploy your parachute whenever you are in the air, leading to aerial combo maneuvers that would shame an airplane stunt pilot.  While games like Red Faction Guerrilla had a particular mechanic like building destruction to separate them, Just Cause 2 uses the grapple and parachute dynamic in combination with the insane action to truly separate itself from the others in the genre.The downsides?  The actual missions and story are terrible.  Seriously, they're bad, do not buy this game if you like immersion in stories or innovative missions, they are not here.  Missions are all started by a terrible cut-scene with horrible voice acting and writing, then the game-play is tired open-world stuff like ""go here and kill him"" or ""go here and get this thing.""  Also if you stick to only doing main story missions you can burn through the game rather fast... there are only seven, and while you need a certain amount of ""chaos"" to open them, it is not an amazingly high requirement.So why does Just Cause get a 4 out of 5 if the story and missions are tired and bad?  Because the game is such a fun sandbox.  If your priority is to run around an amazing looking world and cause extremely fun chaos, buy Just Cause 2.  If your priority is to experience an intense storyline and feel like you are really inside a foreign country as a spy, stay away from this one, it was not made for you.Note: Game requires Steam activation and tying your game to the Steam client service, which is a form of DRM which restricts resale or even giving the game to someone, as well as perhaps being hard or impossible to run without modification if the Steam platform ever shuts down.

I have an open conversation with Razer support since I've discovered this, but so far they're just running me through the stuff I already tried and don't seem to be aware of an issues with Win7, so my review below stands for now.I knew this had a 1 year warranty, but seeing as I have keyboards that are over 20 years old, and never had a single one fail, I didn't think it would be much of an issue. I took very good care of this keyboard.One night, I was using it without an issue, and shut down my PC. The next day, I start up my PC and after pressing one button, it flips out as if it is pressing all sorts of random buttons. Even unplugging it and connecting another keyboard didn't stop the issue without a reboot. I thought maybe my PC or USB port had issues, so I plugged it into a laptop I'd used it on before (which didn't even have the Razer software installed). Same issue, couldn't even use the laptop's built-in keyboard until I rebooted.I updated firmware, reset to factory settings, anything I could think to try. Then I contacted support. After giving me the list of things to try, which I'd already done (but did again just to be sure), I told them it still didn't work. Their response was ""It will need to be replaced, however as it is 2 years old there is no replacement"".No offer to repair it or swap it out for a refurbished one for a fee or anything. I would have gladly paid $30 or whatever to have it repaired/replaced. They just told me I was out of luck and that was that. I'd understand if I'd mistreated it or if there were any signs of wear, but mine looks like new, and it was obviously something inside the chipset, which I wouldn't have been able to have any affect on.For a 'Premium' product, they don't have much faith in their quality. If they did, they would offer more than a year on their keyboards. My mechanical keyboard from 1985 still works great when its plugged in. No excuse for this. Going with a different brand from now on. Also bought a Razer mouse at the same time, and while it still works, I spent a while wondering why my games were moving so slow, and it turned out the drivers for the mouse were hogging CPU until they fixed it. By the time they fixed it, I'd already replaced and upgraded other parts on my machine as I just assumed it wasn't powerful enough for the new games.",1,"Died after 2 years and good care, company won't stand behind it.",1382400000,"10 22, 2013"

Graphically, the game is beautiful to look at, everything from the enviroments to the character models to the tiniest details are great to look at, the differnt levels are all very different, each with it's own visual style and same goes for characters. The gameplay in MGS4 is very fun and fluid, and controls are tight, it's not hard at all to do much in the game, from hand to hand combat to gun fights to sneaking around, plus the gamplay gets mixed up a bit with some vehicle sections, and the gameplay gets another point due to it's always present, and always great, MGS style boss battles. The story is a typicle MGS story, characters a flushed out good enough, and even though it intrduces some characters new to the series, they seem like they've been there from the start. Almost every previous character from the series makes their grand reapperance in the game, from Meryl and Rose, to Mei Ling and Raiden, every characters story is wrapped up in the game with non left out. Online play can be fun at times, with team based combat, deathmatch, and a capture the flag mode, with a Kojima twist, along with an RPG style character skill system where you assign certain skill to your custom character, from better aim with rifles, to running faster.

The one thing that initially held me back from purchasing a PS4 console was this controller. I am a HUGE fan of the Xbox 360 controller due to how perfectly it fits in the hands and the alternated joy sticks. It made for very comfortable game play. When I saw that Microsoft kept this layout for the Xbox One console, I was leaning toward getting it for that reason alone. However, I chose PS4 for multiple reasons instead and I am very happy I did. I was worried about the controller at first, but now I realized I had nothing to fear. It's a wonderful controller!This controller is very ergonomically friendly. It does not feel like a flimsy/cheaply made controller like PS3/PS2/PS1 controllers. It is slightly larger, allowing for an easier and more comfortable grip. The joysticks have a slight depression in them, allowing your thumbs to hold them more easily without slipping like on the older controllers. It's rechargeable. You can either plug it into your wall outlet or the console itself via USB charger. It comes with a headphone/microphone jack as well. Of course, you know about the share button and the touch pad that is now there.Overall, I'm happy I went with the PS4. I was worried about the controller, but not anymore. I love it.

It is shorter than the first, the dialogue worse than the first, the gameplay/combat is more tedious than the first, and the story is more lacking than the first.  The game really seems like a step back.I beat the game the night I got it... in just a few hours.  The first game was too short, this one is basically a joke.  I don't understand the production company here... the shortness of the first game was probably the biggest complaint.  Why would they make the sequel even shorter?  I've played demos that were longer than this (and they were free).  This is probably part of why the story suffered so much... it was too rushed and made to be a little farcical.  About that:The story is very haphazardly put together and pretty cliche, even for an IP that has many cliche game stories.  All your amazing power and you are just a clone.  That isn't much of a spoiler, since it's in the demo and in the first minute of the game.  Are the three flashes of memory you have your own?  (Yep, that's about how much development the plot has.)  Well, let's not bother with that yet -- let's just save the girl we think we might have fallen for in 10 minutes flat (hey, we beat Anakin's record!) and we might have maybe left behind when we may have sacrificed ourselves in that event that might have happened to us.  Why not, it'll be fun right?  What makes the story even worse is the awful dialogue.  I got so sick of hearing Kota gripe that I wasn't doing something fast enough.  His inane instructions were equally annoying, because I always knew what needed to be done before he opened his mouth.The combat starts out feeling smooth and fun.  Some of the controls are slightly, very slightly, better than the first game.  This game takes a step back, however, in that combat becomes repetitive very quickly.  You basically only fight 4 baddies -- regular/flying troopers, shock troopers, force users, and robots.  These are all recycled throughout the game.  You basically have an ""I-win"" button as well, with the grapple.  Doing it over and over gets incredibly boring, however.  There is at least one memorable moment in the first boss fight, but you'll soon be forgetting it when you get back to the repetitive stuff.  I also noticed that on the PS3 the game lags up quite a bit whenever there is a lot going on.  This happened during regular fighting as well as on the final boss fight.  Nothing says awesome when a Jedi gets up close and personal only to start stuttering.  Still, there were some moments that made me think ""hmm, that's kinda neat"".  The parts of the game where you are falling and using force powers to deflect or blow up stuff in your way was actually enjoyable.You would think with a game so short, it would be difficult to become bored.  It still happened, at least for me.  So, despite the couple of not-quite-saving-graces the game has, I would say it is worth a rental.

So against my better judgement I ran out and bought Simcity over the new Tomb Raider.  The good news is, I have not had any server problems.  The game itself seems stable and so far I have never been kicked off my game.  Around 10:30 last night I did get a &#34;servers will reboot in 5 minutes&#34; popup but it was late for me anyway and they provided fair warning so it was no big deal.  Game does not deserve 1 star anymoreAs I said before, I always liked Simcity games.  My biggest complaint about the old Simcity games was the AI.  If you gave an inch, your Sims would take a mile.  If you built a school your Sims would immediately demand a University.  You built a Police station and they would immediately complain they needed Fire protection.  You built a bus station and they would complain they needed a subway, more rail lines, etc.  They would practically run you out of town as Mayor while you frantically tried to provide every government service the game offered.  Those darn 47%ers.  They were not going to vote for me anyway...  The new Simcity changes all of this.  You have all of the same services and more but other buildings and services are unlocked with city growth and by hitting different goals.  The default of your Sims are to be happy, not bitchy and needy.  If suddenly you do not have enough water, power, sewage etc to keep up with growth your Sims will let you know and get upset.  It is only when they don't have the basics like water and power do they actually get mad at you as Mayor.  These have always been the basics of Sims but this has been improved on upon greatly at a Microeconomic level.  You can click on any building or person in your town and get a view of profits and happiness.  They will tell you what is going well and what they wish to see in their city.  This is very helpful as with the old Simcity games you would almost have to guess what you needed to do.  With this granular information of areas of your city you can better plan as Mayor.You now have specializations.  You do not need to focus on a specialization but it gives the game more depth and a goal to &#34;win&#34;.  Last night I selected the &#34;gambling&#34; specialization.  In doing this I was given a tourist adviser.  This allowed me to plop down my first casino.  Each specialized building allows for at least 5 different additions.  In the case of the casino, over time I added a Blackjack building, a moderately expensive hotel, and a comedy club.  This all adds to your revenue and taxable income and also adds to the amount of tourists coming into your city.Simcity now adds the idea of &#34;quests&#34; into the system.  A thought bubble may appear above a random factory or building with a robber type mask.  The Sim will inform you that he is the crime boss in this town and if you two work together (you as Mayor) you can become rich.  If you accept you will then see this person as an active adviser with different quest criteria that needs to be met.  If you choose to follow the quest line and do what is required you are awarded.  This is normally $X dollars but it is my understanding (I have not seen it yet) that this also opens up specialized buildings for your turn.  I did dp a quest for the Police chief of my town and a Super Hero (it had a unique name but I forget what it was) Manor was unlocked.  This was a special building where a Super Hero lived.  This super hero was then available to me to use around town.  Suddenly crime in my city plummeted.  You flies around automatically.Multiplayer is nonexistent at this point.  Your map is a small zoned city.  You can usually fill up the entire map of your zoned city within 4 hours.  After that the game changes where your goals are to restructure, upgrade and solve city problems.  You can import and export to other zones in your larger Sim world.  You can take control of any of these zones.  This allows you to build any number of other towns.  Maybe one town will focus on Tech and export healthcare services while another generates and exports power.  Of course, imports and exports cost and provide you with income.  Public multiplayer has been removed temporarily until all the server issues get fixed.  Once they enable it again it might provide an interesting system where each city works to provide services to other towns or imports services where needed.The city budgeting system had been improved.  I don't remember ever not cheating with the old Simcity.  You would constantly run out of Simoleons $$ and would either need to wait, take out a loan or enter a command line option to give you another $100,000 Simoleons.  This is no longer as much of a problem.  If you build a 6 lane highway off the bat in your little down you will very quickly run out of money.  However, if you grow wisely and find sources of income, money is not as much of an issue.  Once I had my Casino, I was bringing in $6-8,000 an hour.  On Cheetah time mode an hour is about 1 minute of actual time.  I never had tone of excess money though so the game still did provide a challenge.One of the nicest improvements are the roads and zoning.  Zoning and rezoning costs nothing.  The low, medium and high density is controlled by the road size next to it.  You build a dirt road and zone it residual next to it you will have small houses and trailer parks.  Also, no more power lines or water pipes.  Everything is connected to the road.  This removes a lot of tedious connections or power and frustrating underground connections to water.  You can see the available water below ground to best place water towers but the game is entirely played above ground now.  I have not placed a subway yet so I can not comment on that system.Simcity has always been a strange &#34;game&#34;.  I played for 5 hours yesterday and It seems like 5 minutes.  You get so engrossed with building your city you will suddenly you look up from your monitor and realize you need to pee and you skipped dinner.Should I have bought Tomb Raider over Simcity?  Probably.  The difference is I will play Simcity on and off over the next two years.  I often find myself wanting a time sync game that will offer unique challenges and is different every time you play.  I will pick up Tomb Raider at some point.  I will probably enjoy it but I will play it once and never touch it again.3 1/2 Stars on the Amazon scale (this does not include any thought to DRM or server issues).7.5 /10  Addictive game.  Great game to have in your library for when you are bored.  The best SimCity so far.  The random quests and activities offer something that was missing from the previous Simcity games.

5325,132587,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B002E6XY6K,S. Rhodes,"[7, 8]","In the early 90's, Sega released a CD add-on for the Genesis.  It was called (aptly enough) the Sega CD.  It didn't exactly do well.  Although there were a couple of stand out titles, none seem to stand out more to the RPG fanatic like one game in particular: Lunar the Silver Star.  The game was, for it's release in 1992, something that blew the entire competition away with it's graphics, sound and animated cutscenes.  Today it all seems laughable to compliment, but twenty years ago it was an astonishing technical achievement.  But because the Sega CD never met that much of an audience, Lunar the Silver Star was underplayed.  Seven years later (at least for North America) a Playstation Port called Lunar Silver Star Story Complete came out with updated visuals, smoother cutscenes and a more coherent and character driven story.  It was a remake and remastered version that actually exceeded the quality of the original by expanding on stories, cutting out all the things that added nothing to the story and fleshing out the characters more.Since then Lunar has had a couple of releases.  There is a release you can find on the Gameboy Advance.  You can also find a version of the game on the Apple store.  But none of them stand out nearly as much as the Playstation original.  Someone must be hoping to expose a new generation to the game because the PSP version is (technically) the sixth version of the game you can find (although I'm sure it dropped down before the version that's on IPads and ITouch devices).  It's a good story, but the PSP version is not the definitive version.  It looks better and the like, but there's a sense of charm that's simply not there anymore.The actual story in Lunar Silver Star Story is pretty standard and basic.  Alex dreams of adventure.  He wants to be the next Dragon Master.  When his friend Ramus comes to him with the idea of sneaking into the white dragon cave and getting the dragon diamond, Alex is excited.  Once they have the gem in their possession they're given they're given the chance to go to a large city and sell it.  What starts off as just a small quest for adventure becomes something so much more as Alex is soon engulfed in a story that will send him all over the world of Lunar, ultimately saving the world and fulfilling his destiny.From the outset Lunar seems like a formulaic, by the books, type of story.  Yet what really makes the impact so lasting are the characters and their emotional connection to each other.  The characters are really amazing and they really draw us in.  This is ultimately why Lunar is often considered one of the greatest stories in the genre.  It's basic at it's core, but the emotional fulfillment is unmatched by several other stand out games of the genre.  While other games in the genre really have good stories, they often fail to make the characters and the interactions between them stand out on the emotional level that Lunar Silver Star Story does.  In Lunar the characters are more than just ""the mage,"" or ""the barbarian.""  Certainly those roles are there, but they are breathing with personality.  Alex (our hero) is a calm and reserved young man.  The characters around him are certainly more interesting, but they have things about them that make them stand out.  Nash is a magician of Vane.  And while he fulfills the role of the mage, he is also arrogant and self-centered.  Mia is also a mage with some very sagelike wisdom but has a hard time facing confrontation.  Jessica fulfills the role of the white mage with her healing spells but she is anything but kind and gentle.  Kyle is the warrior and while he certainly fulfills the role of an oaf he clearly has a heart of gold and a deep rooted sense of leadership.  Their personalities all come together and mesh.  Each character also grows by the end of the story.  Nash doesn't simply remain an arrogant young man, for instance.  Every character comes into an arc and comes into their own.The Playstation version of Lunar is the best because the writing and dialog exchanges were the best.  The characters had a natural banter between themselves.  Not everything was always so serious and about moving the plot forward, but also about growing the characters.  It was lighthearted and humorous.  A far cry from the (then) overpopulation of dark and angsty characters that had been populating so much of the genre since Final Fantasy VII had arrived.  There was nothing ""dark and mysterious,"" about Alex, for instance.  He's just a young boy who craves excitement.  None of this sort of apathetic approach.  Believe it or not this made Lunar Silver Star Story Complete feel like it was ahead of the curve in 1999 even though it had already done this in 1992.  Lunar seemed to remind us it was okay to smile and laugh in an era where the JRPG was so concerned with giving us dark, brooding and mysterious characters more often than not.  And as a result, Lunar's characters feel more down to earth and sympathetic.  You rarely find a JRPG with an ensemble cast that blends together so well.Which is precisely why the PSP version felt like such a letdown once I was done.  The things that were so good about Lunar on the Playstation were not so good about the PSP version.  Like George Lucas's many editions of Star Wars, Lunar was given a few changes that either seemed to change the context or undermine certain story elements.  In particular, the PSP version isn't nearly as well written.  The dialog is not as natural, humorous or as emotionally driven.  As a result some of the character interactions feel stale and devoid of the heartfelt emotion.  It's not all gone.  The basic structure of the story is still there, but it's sure-fire proof that how you handle and deliver that story is important.  And even a tiny thing such as word choice really makes a difference.  The characters aren't behaving strangely out of character or anything, but their interactions do feel a little different.  In some games changing the word choice can really strengthen the characters and bring the world in which the game takes place more to life (I personally thought the localization in Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions was far better than the Playstation original).  Other times it can make certain moments feel less than the sum of their parts (I wasn't particularly fond of some of the changes to the DS translation of Chrono Trigger... somehow referring to Magus and his army as ""fiends"" in the DS version made them sound a lot less intimidating than calling them ""mystics"").There is nothing more bothersome about it all than the voice acting, however.  The Playstation version had good voices with the right kind of emotion.  It felt quite meticulous.  Despite how annoying Nall's voice could be, at the very least Nall sounded the way he looked.  Ramus actually sounded like an excited teenager (or overgrown child, your choice).  But here, a lot of the voices don't seem to suit some of the characters.  Likewise, the dialog in these scenes is also slightly altered.  Lunar Silver Star Story Complete wasn't a game that was really in need of changes or ""updates.""  It was quite well endowed at the time of its release.  Some of these changes just don't feel that good.  The voice acting may be one of the more disappointing moments.  The Playstation version showed us that video games were more than capable of competent voice acting.  It's a shame to see this big of a step back for a game that at one point was able to pride itself on just how good its voice acting was.The graphics are also altered.  This is actually not quite as bad.  The game is still colorful and beautiful, though the sprites are updated to actually be closer to the artwork.  I have few complaints here.  It's actually not so bad and it's easy on the eyes.  Especially because it's so colorful and vibrant.  Though I miss the charm of the Playstation Sprites (and even the Sega CD to a great extent) here the sprites have a lot of detail and character.Thankfully, in terms of fighting and whatnot, Lunar Silver Star Harmony doesn't feel quite as different.  Battling is very much the same as it was in the other versions.  You select your characters commands, you watch a round of combat, rinse and repeat.  Battles are simpler, however.  One of the many things that was so fun about the Playstation version of Lunar was that it was a game that was somewhat difficult, and wasn't afraid to let you know.  While it didn't lay you out often, the Playstation version was very meticulous about making sure you take the time to level up when you could and very big on making sure you used characters as they were intended to be used.  That being the game made sure that say... Mia wasn't somehow going to the frontlines to attack.  The game gave her such an excess of MP that it was obvious what the game wanted you to be doing with her.  She's a mage, and the game wasn't going to let you forget it.Here it's no where near as difficult.  Harmony is far more forgiving.  Granted you won't be able to turn Mia into some kind of warrior, but the barrier to level up is a little lower, enemies feel weaker.  The emphasis here is much more concerned with getting you through the story than making sure you take the time to reach the proper levels.  It's a lot easier to get through this time around.All that said, Lunar Silver Star Harmony isn't a bad game by any means.  It is only to say that my memories of the Playstation version of the game were enough to interfere with my enjoyment of this version.  Some games could certainly use an update and a makeover to make them more current... or to make them more accessible to a younger generation of gamers, but Lunar isn't one of them.  It had that moment in 1999 when it was released as Lunar Silver Star Story Complete.  There was simply no need to do it again in this fashion.  If you've never played Lunar before you might be tempted to get this, but I actually believe that going the extra mile for the Playstation version is a better idea.  The story is somehow more alive and affecting there than it is here.",3,A Remastered Game Spoiled by the Perfection of an Older Version,1368230400,"05 11, 2013"

That's all I could take because the camera control is so cumbersome.  The game uses the third mouse button / scroll wheel to enable free movement of the camera.  This button is difficult to hold down on my mouse and made my hand cramp.  If there was a way to change the mapping so that I could use the right mouse button for camera control (which is what I'm used to) it would be fine, but there is no such option.  If there was full movement of the camera via the keyboard I could probably live with it, but there isn't: you can only rotate left and right (you cannot pivot up and down).If the game had ""grabbed"" me I might have tried to work through these user interface issues, but the storyline was uninspired and the combat was repetitive and uninteresting.  Some of the scenes were beautiful and the equipment and character progression was fun to play with, but that was not enough for me to put up with the camera control and I figured that if the story was trite at the beginning it probably would only get worse (most RPG's have great beginnings and only mediocre endings).

10258,88569,A1NA3BY2VED6TT,B000SH3XEK,K. Seyfert,"[0, 0]","I will start by saying this is going to be my most brief SVR review of the series.Why rate it 4 stars for fun and 2 overall?  For me it's as simple as saying this is SVR07 with the annoucing glitches fixed and somewhat improved load times.  Had the game somehow managed to squeeze RVD and Angle in for one last hoorah I'd probably say it's a 5/5 for fun since their absence is a major downer (although you can make some pretty decent CAW's for each).The new wrestling categories like Powerhouse and High Flyer I could really do without.  In fact I pretty much ignore their existance (haven't even attempted to use them since I don't really want anything resembling an arcade experience when I play a wrestling video game unless I'm playing HCTP).Certain things bother me that bothered me in SVR07 such as Chris Masters not being introduced as, ""the Masterpiece"".  BUT.. if you win the match the announcer then remembers to announce you as ""the Masterpiece"" Chris Masters.  Why not have the title during the entrance?  Makes no sense to me.The reduced number of grapples is basically the same as 07; with 2 grapples entirely dedicated to UCM's which takes some fun out things unless you actually like those.**edit**I forgot that in SVR07 you had 4 categories of grapples + a UCM per category but only 2 categories were wrestler specific.  Sorry for that oversight.**end edit*The game looks great and plays equally well.  The hit detection is spot on and it's nice to actually see the damage you do to your opponent really seem to effect them as the match grinds on.  Ever notice in some of these titles that even though the guys are limping around from their beatings that they'll find some way to sprint across the ring to save their tag partner out of nowhere?  That doesn't happen here; if you beat the opponent's tag partner to the point they're glowing red all over they are doing nothing but hobbling around the ring regardless of the situation.  I actually didn't get this sense as much in 09 but I could be misremembering.  I should play that one again to confirm...Random side note.. the finisher special effect is by far the most dissapointing in the series.  It's just a quick 3 angle view of the move with some weak sound effect (and kind of time warp-like effect).  I would like to think given a bit of thought they could have come up with something better; especially considering how much I enjoy the finisher effects in 09 and 10.As always it's a must own for any SVR fan EVEN IF this is widely considered the worst title in the series.  By all means it probably is the worst when compared to the others but it's still worth owning just for the year to year changes in rosters/attires.

No matter how subjectively good a handheld game is, the fact that it's on a handheld is a handicap in my eyes. And I know I'm not alone. There are tons of gamers like me who are simply far more comfortable playing on a big screen, holding a controller. (Or sitting in front of a PC.) It probably goes back to my childhood, when handheld games were the bottom of the barrel. If you wanted to play a real game you went to an arcade, the next best thing was playing on an Atari or Intellivision console connected to your TV, and if that was out of reach then you played crummy little handheld games with little LED blips that didn't even technically qualify as graphics. Those are the roots of handhelds in my mind. For me there is simply no denying that handheld games are intrinsically gimped. Bringing a console franchise to handheld requires unavoidable sacrifice, and for me personally, the gimping simply isn't worth it. Still, I'm a hopelessly addicted gamer so I keep buying handhelds and games to play on them. Every once in a while I'll find one that overcomes the handicap and makes it all worthwhile.Unfortunately MGS Peace Walker is not one of those games. I was leery from the moment it was announced, because I figured it was going to be Portable Ops 2. Thankfully, it's isn't THAT bad. But it isn't too far from it. I got PW the day it came out and played it for about four hours. For me, that's generally more than enough time to adapt to a new game's controls and start to feel comfortable. But PW just felt annoying to play with its castrated control scheme, some of the characters immediately got on my nerves, the sloppy smeared comic book style cut scenes struck me as eye sores, the game play being broken up into tiny little bite-size chunks was very unsatisfying, the bosses were ponderous chores, and after realizing that using ""auto-assign"" on the Mother Base staff was working against me I soon learned that managing the staff manually was a complete bore... I just wasn't enjoying it, so I dropped it and forgot all about it. A little over a year later it was included in the PS3 HD collection. I still wasn't interested, but after playing through MSG2 and MGS3 I figured ""Why not?"" It was marginally more enjoyable playing it as ""a real game,"" and I did manage to stay with it long enough to see the credits. But I still thought it was close to being the worst game in the MGS series, second only to Portable Ops. After MGSV plot details started coming to light and I learned to my horror that it was basically Peace Walker 2, and after being inspired by Ground Zeroes, I managed to force myself to go back and truly finish Peace Walker, i.e. do all of the post credits stuff in order to see the ""true"" ending.I admit, I like it a little better now than I did before. If I'd bothered to review it back in 2010, I would have given it two stars.The one thing that really chaps my hind about Peace Walker (and MGSV) is that they hired Robin Atkin Downes to play the role of Miller. The guy gives the most generic and banal performances in all of voice acting, he only knows one note and I don't understand why he keeps getting hired.

I have to use the Triangle button, but that is not even the worst aspect of this game. The worst is that fact that your ship loses all of its speed every single time you miss a turn or bump into an enemy ship and that's another problem. Nothing is more annoying in this game then having to pass another ship and have that ship bump into you slowing you down.

3642,206390,AMW84IL4L9EYS,B0088MVOES,,"[0, 0]","As a die-hard fan of LotR and the Lego franchise of video games, I was super pumped when my fianc&eacute;e gave me this game for my birthday. Up until the release of this game, we had completed most of the Lego games, including the Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Harry Potter installments. However, this game is by far the worst in the series, and I want to use this review to point out the few good points, but mostly negative points about this game.Most of the Lego games feature a series of three movies (the only one I know of being more was the Star Wars one, which features all six episodes on one game) in which each movie hosts between five or six levels each. Within the levels, one must solve puzzles and defeat various bosses to unlock characters, find hidden treasure, and red Lego brick extras that enhance the game play. It becomes extremely fun for `collectionists' to get 100% of the game, which generally is not hard to accomplish, but does take some time. Lego's LotR's does not disappoint in this area. Besides a slew of bonus characters to unlock and play, as well as the red bricks, there are several mini quests one can take to earn mythril bricks, which are then used to build different armor and weapons.In the previous Lego games, you generally started in a central hub and could then access the various movies and levels from there. For example, in Star Wars, the hub was the Mos Eisley Cantina on Tatooine. In the first Batman game, your hub is the bat cave of course. LotR departs from this long tradition. In order to get to the next level you must travel to various locations in Middle-Earth. While the map is open-ended, it is linear. You can access a map to see where you are going and can set waypoints (blue Lego studs in which to follow), although the waypoint system can be annoying. Until you beat the game and unlock Freeplay mode, your waypoint will remain on the main quest, and even if you switch it--oh say you want to unlock a new character--the waypoint will readjust itself to the original quest whether you want it to or not. While the area of travel is not like Skyrim in size, the idea of the easy accessibility of the hub is truly missed on this game. Even in Harry Potter, where the hub was the whole of Hogwarts, you still entered levels via a smaller hub (the little blackboard).The game follows the three novels of LotR, though it is mimics the movies in just about every way. This is easy to see in the voice acting and appearances of the characters and creatures. By the way, this is the first Lego game to actually have the characters talk. A very small negative, but one nonetheless. However, it was nice to unlock characters like Tom Bombadil and Radagast the Browb, which were not portrayed in the movies.There is some of the good and bad, now on to the ugly. The first horrendousness of the game is the split screen. Unless you play by yourself, you are forced to either play co-op in a split screen, which means when you need to shoot or throw something across the level, it becomes difficult to see where you are aiming. If you do not accept split screen, it will still do so when you wander away from your partner. This could be only a few feet from them, so if you run back and forth, a solid black line weaves in and out of focus and makes game play incredibly distractive. I remember this first appeared in the Lego: Pirates game, but I do not remember it being so horrible. Second, none of the characters can swim, and there is a lot of water in the game. If you fall in a body of water, you have to continuously mash on a button until you jump out. If you are crossing a body of water that requires several jumps, you are placed back at the beginning. Obviously this ups the hardness of the game, but if the Lego series are aimed at kids, then this is ridiculous. In other Lego games you could swim, and with special gear or characters, sink to the bottom and walk around to explore.Third, the puzzles in the game range from super easy to scratch your head difficult. Lego puzzles have always been somewhat challenging, but you could generally figure them out. Here, we have characters that do not perform as they should, and require expert timing to nail a certain move. A good example is the level in which you must take down several of the war elephants. While these elephants are trying to trample you, Legolas must run to catch up to one, shoot two arrows at different locations, then jump from arrow to arrow to rope just to get on top of the thing! Granted it only took me a couple of times, but again, what about the kids? Other annoying game play includes getting caught by the Nazgul, Boromir, or the undead army, and having to mash buttons to escape. Last, while I like that there is plenty to do in this game, the way it plays out is difficult to do unless looking at a FAQ. Here is an example. Say, for instance you want to get an extra (red brick) in the game. First, you have to find a person (or creature) that will give you the red brick (to purchase of course), but only if you find something for them first. Sometimes they want you to craft something in mythril. If it is the latter, than you have to have enough mythril bricks, and hope you did not spend to many on crafting another item previously. If it is the former, than you must find an item inside a certain level. While this is not difficult by any means, and adds to the amount of time you will end up playing the game; in previous Lego games, you could simply find the red brick in a level and then go to a store to purchase the extra.The game play is fun for the most part, especially if you are a fan of LotR, both the novels and the movies. If you are a fan of the Lego series, like myself, you will be disappointed. It all comes down to the idea that ""if it isn't broken, why fix it?"" Doing away with the hub, making it difficult to obtain the extras to get 100%, beefing up the difficulty of the game play and puzzles, and doing away with other traditions which made the Lego games down right fun and enjoyable make Lego LotR the worst in the series. I hope Lego returns to the old style in their future games, or else I'll probably have to pass on them. And since Lego is making Marvel Lego toys now, a possible game from this franchise in the series makes me excited and dreadful at the same time.",3,"By far the worst in the series, even for a LotR's fan",1361059200,"02 17, 2013"

Well, not only is Halo by far the best FPS for a console I've ever played, it's the best FPS I've EVER played, and one of the best GAMES, period. If this is what we can expect from the Xbox, well, thank God I have one, that's all I can say.Typically, no shooter can compare with the holiest of holys, Half-Life. Half-Life has been the pinnacle of what the genere was capable of, and nothing could ever quite match it.'Till now, anyway.Halo rolls everything you could want in a shooter all into one package, save online play. You want immense outdoor environments? Here you go. Tons of weapons? Okay, we'll let you use the human weapons AND the alien weapons, how's that? Good AI? Try this. On the hardest difficulty level, the enemies will position sqauds on either side of any given hidey-hole you're cowering in, toss a good number of grenades to flush you out, and mow you down from two different directions when you make a run for it. Should you somehow live through that, they'll regroup, laying down cover fire, and try to split up and circle around you, leaving the tougher troops to face you head-to-head while the smaller guys gang up and shoot you in the back while the others have you engaged.What else, you say? Well, okay. Every game like this has a gimmick. Half-Life had the fact that you could take guards and scientists with you. Red Faction had the fact that you could blow holes in walls. Halo? Ohhh. Let's count 'em.For one thing, you have your Marines. They will fight WITH you, and they're no slouches. They react to the fight, think quickly, and will follow your lead but take the initiative if it presents itself. Flush an enemy out, and most often they're waiting to take it down. Need to snipe some enemies? They'll hold off until you're finished, and back you up if the enemies get too close.Next, there's the enemies. Each enemy has a very different way of attacking, be it head-on, defensive, swarming, bait-and-attack tactics, whatever. The alien weapons are actually no better than the human ones, but sometimes are preferrable given certain situations.Then we have the plot. While it's a little simple and contrived early on, there are major plot twists down the pipe. When you finally find out what Halo actually is, not to mention who really lives there, you'll be impressed by the scope of the story to say the least. It's Sci-Fi, but it's good Sci-Fi.Lastly, and easily the best, we have vehicles. LOTS of vehicles. Get in the Marine Warthog jeep and a Marine will jump in back, manning the cannon. If he gets taken out, you can jump in the back  yourself and use the gun. If a friend is playing with you, have HIM drive while you shoot, or vice versa. In one instance, I was driving a tank while my friend rode on it with a Sniper Rifle. I'd shell an area, and he'd pick off stragglers with the rifle. You can steal enemy air fighters and use them in skirmishes, or use them to back up a buddy on the ground. If you distract the enemies by flying overhead, he can get closer unnoticed until it's too late for the enemies. Knock enemies out of stationary gun turrets and climb in yourself.Enemy placement is randomized a bit, so no two battles are ever alike. Voice acting is quite good, graphics are beautiful and have NO slowdown at all, and the sounds have a great deal of OOMPH to them.This game raises the standard for all shooters to come. This is American game making at it's pinnacle, and if you've ever wanted the ideal action game, here it is.NO Xbox owner should be without this game!",5,"Outstanding, immersive, and very, very fun.",1008115200,"12 12, 2001"

Played World at War, MW2, MW3, but still, for some reason, I thought Black Ops 1 was the funnest.  Now I'm not talking just graphics here but overall play.  What I like about BO1 was the slower pace, the less ridiculous attachments and gadgets, and most of all, the maps.  Maps independently varied from large to small but the greatest part was how these maps were arranged to disrupt camping.  Black Ops 1 replaced COD4MW1 as #1 imo.Black Ops 2 however is very fast and most maps have buildings where enemies can stick together and camp tight when they chose (which is most of the time!).  Picture 4 enemies in a room, each in a corner, with 2 bouncing bettys and 2 electrical stun gadgets ... almost impossible to disrupt.  Maps are so-so, pace is too fast, camping is way TOO MUCH, gadgets/attachments out of hand, killstreaks flat out crazy.  I'm not kidding and hopefully some will agree that there is more camping this game than any other COD game.  It's not fun when you look for a guy to kill and you die going into the same room 5 times.  Camping exists in every game but way too much here.  The boards were arranged much better in BO1.Now I'm a descent player, top prestige all CODs with about 2.0 K/D.  Why is it MW1 was funner than MW2 and BO1 funner than BO2?  I don't know since sequels are supposed to be better but it seems like they always find something to ruin.  Don't get me wrong, graphics improve and that's a plus, but that's about it.Honestly, this paves the way for Battlefield realism and it's rush squad/team oriented play.  I am honestly so tired of COD releasing a mediocre game each year to many us cough up $60.  It's getting like Madden, which I boycotted this year for the first time.  Maps are very important in shooters.  Give us something good, you only have 1 year to design them!  Sometimes 2 since Treyarch develops one year and Infinity Wards another!Want $60?

For all the talk about FSW being an accurate simulation of tactical combat FSW falls way short.The GoodThe graphics. That's about it. And even then there are plenty of problems. For starters you hardly have any control over any options. Want to turn off shadows (notorious frame rate killers), not possible. I have a pretty high-end rig and I encounter lousy frame rates, and tons of stuttering with the audio dialog. Only by turning down the visual features can I get acceptable performance, but then the stunning graphics are no more.The BadUnfortunately for Pandemic, this would encompass the rest of the entire game. Enemy AI is lousy at a distance, and entirely scripted. Restart a level, and they'll be in the same places every time, so forget about replay value.If FSW is an accurate representation of the Army's capabilities, then we are in real trouble. While the soldiers move and take up basic firing position correctly, their reactions are terrible. When directed to take cover, they'll frequently use some of the worst cover around. Their shooting accuracy is terrible, often spending more time shooting everything around a target rather than the target itself.FSW is clearly built for a console and not a PC. Load times are terrible, save points (Doesn't every developer by now know that this is a terrible way to treat PC users), limited configuration options, and a gamepad-esq interface.Don't think for a second the manual will prove useful. The instructions are vague, with poor text descriptions to define actions, with no supporting graphics.While Pandemic attempted to reflect reality in the game through degrading cover, tactical movements, and liberal use of swearing (Great way to represent out soldiers, they swear more than a trucker in a shouting match with a longshoreman), FSW just falls flat on itself as a tactical shooter.Save your money and move on to something better.",2,Pretty pictures... not much else,1097539200,"10 12, 2004"

The gameplay is still the same as the previous 3: investigate crime scene, talk to people, gather evidence, and go to court.  A new feature in this game is the Perceive ability which replaces the Psyche Lock from previous games and instead of presenting evidence to make people tell the truth, you look at people, study their actions and when they do something abnormal, you start to break them to cause them to talk.  I acctually enjoyed it more than the Psyche Lock, mostly because that feature esstially made court time pointless because you would have figured out who did it by then.The 3 things that ruin this game the most are:1.  The CharactersAll of them werent unique and esstianlly replace previous characters and act in the same way they did.  Apollo is like a rookie Pheonix Wight, only he never really develops and is never sure of himself.  Pheonix was able to acctually solve things by himself whereas Apollo for the most part has to be lead through the case to come to a conclusion.  Hes a smart kid but just doesnt apply himself very much.  Trucy is like Maya, only she swtiches from being more annoying than her or more helpful.  Klavier is a cross between von Karma and Edgeworth, he really only cares about the truth and acctually helps the defense for the most part, but at the same time, hes a german rockstar.  Why you ask?  Because the game says so.  I could go on but you should get the point by now.  Also on a side note, the supporting characters for the cases were beyond annoying.  One case involves a whiney 19 year-old punk who acctually talks gangster (""Im totally straight up O.G. man!"" for instance) while another case involves a ""russian"" who says ""dah"" every other word.2.  FlashbacksHaving a few flashbacks every now and then is fine, but having nearly every other dialoge sequence a flashback on something we learned just 5 minutes ago gets extremely annoying and is unacceptable.  How many times do I have to see a guy be murdered?  How many times do I have to watch the same music video?3.  The Cases themselvesThe cases for the most part werent very interesting and the entire case itself will completely do a 180 every time you prove something wrong.  One witness will completely change their location over 3 times which will make the entire case either more confusing or annoying.  The murderers are so painfully obvious that they might as well be wearing a large neon sign saying ""I did it!"" and it becomes more apparent who it is by the time the second investigation starts.While the game was for the most part fun, it was also annoying at most times for the 3 reasons listed above and at one point I had to put the game down and take a break because I couldnt stand the characters anymore.  The game was extremely easy compared to the previous ones and I had to consult a guide maybe twice.  If youre new to the series, go start with the first game, Pheonix Wright: Ace Attorney, and decide if you like it or not.

In rare cases where the mini-joysticks may need to be re-calibrated, you can use the process below. Please note that this process only works for the Cordless Precision Controller for Xbox.1. Remove one battery.2. Hold the Left Trigger and Start buttons while re-inserting the battery. (NOTE: Do not touch or move the mini-joysticks at all during this time. It is very important that the mini joysticks are allowed to center themselves during this step or the calibration procedure will not be successful.)The mini-joysticks should now be re-calibrated. Please note that in some cases you may need to resynchronize the gamepad and receiver after this procedure.

8080,156845,AY55J49QMLEYA,B003O6E67A,Jason,"[53, 64]","I am not one for horror movies, scary movies, FPS shooters that feature zombies in game after game (I'm looking at you Call of Duty) or that sort of thing, so after I got my PS3 I never found myself that compelled to pick up either Resistance FoM or Resistance 2.  However, reading the previews and watching the trailers for Resistance 3, I found myself very much interested.  Having played a great amount of Resistance 3 single and multiplayer I can report that I am very glad I picked this one up.GraphicsThis game is not as beautiful or graphically amazing as Killzone 3.  However it does look quite good.  The textures, the lighting especially make this game look incredible.  From an artistic standpoint, this game looks just simply incredible.  The guns look detailed, the textures are deep, the character models are quite good but the environments are what will capture your attention the most.Presentation:Because the environments are so beautiful and captivating, the game does a phenomenal job putting you into a role as one of the last survivors on earth.  You can really buy into the idea that you're at the end of a war that has gone terrible.  The music, the graphics, the sound effects all effectively present what happens.Gameplay:Most notable about this game is that it gives a shout-out to older FPS games by allowing you to hold more than 2 weapons, in fact you can hold as many as you like on your weapon wheel.  You also must gather health packs to revive.  It reminds me of the first FPS I played which was Star Wars: Dark Forces.  This is a good thing.  I hate having to drop weapons on the ground to pick up a new one, the simple weapon wheel system (like Assassins Creed) works well.  It is a pleasure to switch weapons to make the tactics you need available to get the upper hand.  A shotgun is an excellent weapon when you're being surrounded by zombie alien hordes, but a sniper rifle is most effective at distance.  The bulls-eye allows you to hone in on enemies even when they're moving and you're firing elsewhere, which is helpful for grasshopper aliens.  The augment (shooting through walls) gun is effective particularly to find out where enemies are hiding.Sound:The music and sound effects are sensational and help add to the atmosphere and feeling of the entire game.  The music is well composed and sometimes the silence is more dramatic and intense than the music itself.Multiplayer:The multiplayer is quite buggy particularly here within the first week, but considering the beta and two giant updates to R3, I wonder why it is so full of errors.  Much like any other modern FPS, multiplayer supports a leveling up system as well as a class system.  As you level up you may create your own class and you can choose your own combination of guns, power-ups, grenades and so forth.  Any upgrades your purchase for one class is available to all other classes (unlike KZ3) which is good.  Besides the glitches in multiplayer, the game feels a little off balanced because certain players with upgraded guns & power-ups particularly in combination really over-run other players at lower levels.  However, I find this to be a similar problem to various FPS multiplayer leveling up systems.  It simply takes so long to accumulate the points to purchase new abilities, guns, powers, and so forth.Overall, this FPS is a phenomenal addition to your PS3 game collection especially if you enjoy First Person Shooters.  The single player is dark, gritty and creepy and the multiplayer despite its flaws is a fun sensational experience.UPDATE:The more hours I put into the campaign and multiplayer the more I have come to appreciate the art design of the game.  While perhaps R3 doesn't do anything that other FPS haven't done before, it does them well, it does them with a great post-apocalyptic style and great level design.  One complaint I have is that there are a few levels where the game encourages you to be stealthy, but the game doesn't always give you the tools to do so. It does a good job trying to creep you out with aliens in abandoned-post alien-end of the world as we know it places all across America.  Its' story is grim and though you don't know the main characters you care about what happens to them.",4,Resistance 3 is a great FPS even if this is your first entry into the Resistance Series...,1315612800,"09 10, 2011"

7023,178828,A7Y0L2NFTE3QJ,B004X56PWK,The_Scrutiny,"[0, 0]","Sonic Generations was made to please fans of both classic and modern Sonic. You'll race through levels from various Sonic games throughout the ages, experiencing waves and waves of nostalgia as you go. But this game relies upon far more than fond memories. Here's my breakdown:Story:If you must know, Dr. Eggman and Dr. Robutnik have teamed up to mess up time. As the 2 Sonics, you'll race through the worlds at top speed to restore places and rescue friends. Speaking of Sonic's friends, you'll cringe every time they have a dialogue. It's that bad. Anyways, no one plays these games for story, so I'll just dock a point for lame voice acting.Score: 4/5Graphics/Setting:What I've always appreciated about Sonic games is the fact that they don't follow the whole photo-realistic craze. You'll dash through bright, refreshing environments that take you all over Sonic's history, starting with Green Hill Zone way back from Sonic the Hedgehog 1 to Planet Wisp from the recent Sonic Colors. The more familiar you are with Sonic games, the more you'll get out of Generations because of nostalgia, but anyone will enjoy it regardless. Speaking of nostalgia, this game does NOT play it safe by merely copying and pasting the levels it draws from. These are levels with obviously similar themes, but redesigned structure, so they feel both old and new in the best possible ways. And it's always a pleasure to play modern versions of classic levels and vice versa. The levels feel just right no matter which Sonic you play as.Score: 5/5Gameplay:As classic Sonic, you'll utilize the famous spin dash, smash in TV boxes containing rings and powerups, and bounce off enemies on your way to the familiar banner at the end of the level. As modern Sonic, you'll boost at break-neck speeds, homing-attack bots, and stomp your way to the giant ring goal. A quick note: don't worry about moving so fast that you won't be able to see obstacles coming; the game is pretty fair about reaction time. However, you'll still need to know levels inside and out for a smooth run, and this applies to both Sonics. The game mixes things up by giving you optional skills. These are welcome enhancements that do things like give you the signature fire/water/lightning shields or make you brake faster. The number of skills you can equip is limited, so you'll have to strategize which skills to use for which levels. Levels themselves are a blast to play. You'll never tire of discovering and taking shortcuts, all the while listening to the incredible soundtracks provided for each version of levels. Even better, YOU CAN CHANGE the soundtracks for levels by choosing from unlocked music in the gallery! If you're still not convinced about this game I have 2 words for you: Super Sonics.Score: 5/5Missions:And here is where Sega could have gone with the policy ""less is more."" When you're not zipping through the 18 main levels, you might be engaging in not-so-fun side missions. These have you collecting a certain number of rings or making it to the goal with limited time. There are even some that feature a friend. These missions are nowhere near as fun as the main stages and there are 30 of these that completionists will feel obligated to muddle through. At least they offer soundtracks and artwork upon beating them. One of my favorite things about Generations, though, are the red rings. There are 5 of these in each main level and collecting all 5 yield skills to use. The best part is that you'll get hints on where these are found, and they usually are found on shortcut routes, serving as a guide for the quickest way through a stage. Very clever, Sega.Score: 4/5Overall:This is such a remarkable game, and it's a well-needed break from the myriad of realistic-looking shooter games flooding the console market nowadays. This game will test your skills as you race through beautiful, well-designed worlds, learning shortcuts and memorizing routes. Classic and modern Sonic are both great fun to play as. Skill sets add a welcome strategic element to gameplay, and the soundtrack is stellar. My few complaints are somewhat tedious side missions and lame friend characters. These are easy to overlook in the grand scheme of things. Trust me, from the moment you start up this game, greeted by the unforgettable Genesis era menu music, you'll be enchanted. Beware! Nostalgia awaits!Overall score: 4.5/5",5,Easily one of the best Sonic games ever made,1368921600,"05 19, 2013"

However, with all of the other unlucky owners who have been having overheating problems with their systems, I felt compelled to protect my 360.  Sure, Microsoft extended the warranty to 3 years, but why be without my 360 for several weeks if it can be avoided?  For a long time I sat and wondered if buying an external cooler was necessary.  After playing through Saints Row and having the game freeze or stall on me several times, I was convinced I should.  So I bought myself this Nyko Intercooler thinking ""aside from spending 20 unnecessary bucks, what can it hurt?""Apparently a lot.  Fortunately I realized this before it too late but this thing was doing more harm than good, and for others who have purchased this, it was too late, and it killed their 360.  Apparently drawing power from the 360 makes it even more prone to overheating.Technically, it works.  It's easy to install, and the fans increase airflow.  But what difference does it make if the fans work if it overheats the 360 anyway?  Oh and if I'm not mistaken, Microsoft's warranty doesn't cover damage done by this product because it's an unlicensed product.  Super!I should note that aside from the problems in Saints Row, which I've found are from flaws in the game's engine itself and not the actual hardware, I had never had problems with my 360.  But while the Intercooler was attached, I got the Red Ring of Death 3 times, which made my heart jump out of my chest but it was only momentary and started up fine on the next attempt each time.  After hearing some very unhealthy noises (this thing is LOUD and I was afraid my CD tray had been damaged or something - seriously, it rivals the noise from the nearby landing planes) I removed this piece of junk.  Now, I cannot confirm this is what caused my dreaded RROD but guess what?  Yup, no more errors!  Coincidence?  I think not.Just do yourself a favor and stay away from this thing which appears to do the exact opposite of what it intends to do.

There's an evil genie. There's a good, pretty female genie. You have to gather rings. First, though, you have to wade through an interminable tutorial sequence to get to the main gameplay.You follow paths of rings - going through tunnels, along tropical beaches, jumping over obstacles, doding falling objects, and more The graphics are nice in an arcadey way, and really, since you're usually flying along at Mach 10, it doesn't really matter. All that matters is getting to that next sequence of rings.This is not a game that you get in ""one pass"".

I got this game at midnight the day it came out, worked fine for the first hour or so. The next day it started glitching more than I've ever seen, even compared to the cartridge days. The fighting system was slow and laggy compared to the other two. The weapons and a lot of the terrain were exact copies from Arkham City.The plot had huge holes in it and the voice acting was sub-par at best. Bruce is more of a thug than a hero in this one and it's just sad. The villains..if you can call them that start to teeter out after the first three or four. Same repetitive QTE sequences with very little difference between them. Just an all around boring, average game.

Such a shame to see such a great series get weighed down by such a disappointment.The multiplayer is a joke and makes you wonder why they even bothered trying to add this useless element to the game. It does nothing for the story and is little more than a shoot-em-up batman style, something you could easily get out of any of the FPS on the market.

All the critic reviews are so impressive that I decided to try it out.  Well, after playing for about a week, I can understand why it got the high scores.  There was a lot of development that went into the game in terms of detail to the massive scale of the city and living environment, which impressively includes weather changes like rain and fog, to what you can do, e.g. you can watch tv in your room or play pool or bowl, etc.  But I found these things tedious and just skipped them throughout.  Even the cutscenes I skipped because they were drawn out. Somewhere around hour 8 or so, the game just kind of dragged for me.  The whole sand-box novelty wore off and I was just hoping the game would end soon. (note: I hate long games, so I'm not into rpg's or I guess these type of games; I'll never be one to complain that a game is too short like some other reviewers.) I realized I wasn't close to finishing the game so I just returned it.  Maybe the game gets better later, but it's already eaten up enough of my time. Glad I rented it instead of buying first, which is something everyone should do nowadays.In conclusion, if you have the time and the interest in these virtual worlds, it's definitely a cool game and pretty amazing considering what you can do in it. Just be prepared to do them umpteen times.Other notes: Regarding the graphics, they are pretty good, just what I expected from looking at the box.

11787,191316,ADPEAVHFCNLLC,B005C2D2MO,Poisoned Blade,"[12, 14]","In Dishonored, you play the Royal Bodyguard to the Empress, and you've been framed for her murder.  Armed with a variety of occult powers suited for stealth and an arsenal of weaponry, you set out to clear your name and bring the conspirators to justice.  This is a linear story-driven game with levels, but there are usually 10 different ways to creatively complete each mission.  You can kill every enemy you encounter or you can complete the entire mission without spilling a drop of blood and without anyone even knowing that you were there.  How you play is up to you.  But there are two different endings, and the chaos you create on your mission will spread throughout the empire.  If you want the `good ending,' try to be as stealthy as possible.  If you want the bad ending, kill everyone, set off all the alarms and cause as much damage as you can.Concept:  9/10The Gameplay of Thief, the storytelling of BioShock, the World Structure of Rage, and a unique steampunk setting all work together to create a memorable experience.  If you haven't played those games, I'll explain.  In Dishonored, your main purpose is to stealthily complete mission objectives in levels.  You can play any way you like and you are greatly encouraged to use stealth and knock out enemies instead of killing them.  As you are sneaking around the levels, there's plenty of treasure and items to find.  As you complete the mission, you can upgrade your gear or buy consumables like health potions or arrows.  The bulk of the story is told through character dialogue, but there's a library of information within the game.  Hidden books and recordings add more detail to the world itself.  After each Mission, you return to a 'friendly town' where the resistance is located.  This is similar to the settlements in Rage.  You can walk around and talk to your allies, get quests, or buy gear from the mechanic.  It's rare that a game will let you creatively complete missions, so Dishonored is a treat.Story:  8/10The empress is killed and you are framed, and you must rescue the heir and ""remove"" all of the key political figures of the old regime.  You can do this violently or non-violently.  It's completely up to you.  There's a good ending and a bad ending, complete with modules about all of the NPC's that you've helped... or slain.World:  8/10The world is kind of an electric / steam punk / whaler city / that's suffering from a plague that turns people into zombies.  It's not even a nice place to visit, but the sounds, game fiction, technology, and art come together nicely to bring this world to life.  Is it an amazing world like in Final Fantasy or Mass Effect?  No, but all of the pieces blend together and it feels like a real place.Graphics:  8/10The graphics are pretty good and the coloring is similar to water colors.  The character designs are a bit cartoonish, but they all do their parts.  There's quite a bit of attention to detail on the buildings and machinery in the game as well.Gameplay:  8/10The Gameplay is Very Fun!  Most of the gameplay involves sneaking past enemies and assassinating your targets.  You can use magic to see through walls, possess an enemy, slow time, stop time, teleport, perform brutal kills, summon swarms of rats, and knock enemies down with a burst of wind.  Your arsenal includes a blade, a pistol, a crossbow with lethal ammo and sleep darts, mines, rewiring tools, and grenades.  With these powers and weapons, you can see how many ways you can sneak past or eliminate a curious guard.  Possess him and make him jump off of a cliff.  Rewire a tesla coil to attack enemies.  Place a landmine on the ground and make some noise.  Freeze time, catch an enemy grenade, and throw it back.  Teleport behind a guard on a rooftop and backstab him.  How you complete the missions are completely up to you.Levels:  9/10The levels were meticulously designed to give you as many options as possible to get to your target.  You can climb drain pipes to get to the roof.  You can possess an enemy and walk right in.  You can battle your way through the guards.  Every Mission will accommodate every play style.  And when you reach your target, there is usually a violent or non-violent way to dispose of them.Player Feedback:  FAILDishonored has one HUGE FLAW.  It fails to inform the Player how much Chaos they are creating as they are playing.  This determines the ending of the game, so if you are into stories, this is the most important information.  All you get is a progress report at the end of each level saying:  Chaos Level:  Low, Medium, or High.  If it is Low, you have some leeway, if it is High, you'd better lay off killing for a while.  But this isn't enough information and you only get it after the mission is over.  As a result, you're actually afraid to kill too many enemies and mostly rely on teleporting and sleep darts.  This could have easily been fixed with a gauge or bar, that lets the Player know that they can kill lots of enemies and still get the good ending.  It would have also been great if you knew how many guys you could kill before the mission starts, so you can adjust your play style.  There were a few times in the game where I was cornered by guards and I let them kill me because I wasn't sure I could fight back without getting the bad ending.  Suicide should never be a strategy in games.  It breaks immersion and limits tactics.In the game's defense, it does do a good job at informing you what your powers do when you upgrade them and there's even a paragraph on how best to use those powers.  The mission objectives are also very clear and you can see checkpoints through the walls with a meter indicator.  If you see Emily 50m, you know that Emily is 50 meters in that direction.  So, you never really get lost.Sound:  9/10The dialogue and creepy sound effects are good as you're hiding in the shadows and planning your next move.Maturity:  M or Older TeensThere's swearing and gore, and some mild suggestive themes.  The story is political and is based on revenge.Replay Value: 5/10There are 9 missions and each one will take 1-2 hours depending on your play style.  If you want to be stealthy and explore, each level will take twice as long.  If you want to attack the enemies, you'll get through the game much faster.  There are multiple endings and once you've finished the game, you can quickly get through it again if you want to see the different endings.Overall:  8/10This is a very fun game that encourages the Player to be clever.  But it discourages them from using their weapons and powers because there's the ""fear of the bad ending"" always hanging over their heads.  If you want a fun, stealth, level based fantasy assassin game, then you should pick this one up.  You might want to wait until it's $39.99.Buy this game if you love being creative as you get past obstacles.Buy this game if you love stealth games.Buy this game if you like revenge stories.Avoid this game if you just want to attack enemies head on and destroy them.Avoid this game if you have little or no patience.Avoid this game if you like open ended worlds.If you liked the stealth elements of this game, check out Batman Arkham Asylum,  Batman Arkham City, or Splinter Cell.

For reasons beyond my control I was without internet for almost a month and there was no way to play this *single player* game for which I paid full money. I understand the reasons behind blizzard making gamers to log online but there should be a option for at least a few offline play-throughs and than the player must log online to renew that option. This is a single player game not a multi-player or MMO that player must always be online. As of now this just rewards the pirates and penalizes honest paying gamers.*Over my long gaming career I have had the most enjoyable experience playing Blizzard games by far. From Warcraft series to World of Warcraft to Diablo to Starcraft. Though there have been occasional hiccups mostly with World of Warcraft like the latest expansion etc.(didn't like it much from under-whelming Monk Class to Asian themed story-line of the recent expansion) but other than that Blizzard single players games are star-studded gems and StarCraft 2 is no exception. Having played the original StarCraft so many years ago, I find SC2 to be a worthy sequel well worth the wait and a evolution of the franchise while keeping steadfast to the game core mechanics.Pretty much SC2 sticks to the traditional mechanics of the RTS genre but the evolution is in the way each mission handles in a completely unique way. Every new mission requires new tactics and you have to come up with innovative strategies to progress while the game requires you to think and to keep on thinking. Combine that with great cut-scenes, conversation options with characters, your own ship to call home and a engrossing story-line which becomes epic and grander in scale as the game progresses make this game a sure-fire winner and among the best of the RTS genre.Highly recommended and looking forward to playing the expansion Heart of the swarm..",4,Blizzard does it again...,1381708800,"10 14, 2013"

Combinations were a pain to execute and often didn't chain well.-The skill system was unsatisfying.  It's based on a purchasing system.  You use a type of currency you collect from completing missions to buy more upgrades.  However you can refund the upgrades you purchase and move your points around.

Maybe it's just me but I prefer becoming more awesome all around as I progress through a game and would rather not have to pick one thing I'm good at.  Or at least have enough points to spread the love around if you know what I mean.-The boss fights were pretty simplistic.  If I didn't figure out the trick to beating them right away, then it only took a few attack cycles to pick out their openings.  Most bosses are only vulnerable at certain times so it mostly feels like a waiting game.-The environments are pretty dull and not interactive in the least.

Contrary to some of these posts, the game is not difficult or tricky - just tedious. For instance, approaching my first Cyclops (and they are relatively weak and slow), notice that there is path too narrow for him to follow from which I can use ranged attack and a big rock that I can run around in order to take the battle closer in and still avoid the one hit instant death scenario. Then notice that he has a full heath bar with two dots above it. This means that you have to kill him three times over - each time you kill him another dot disappears, whatever?! So my companions (pawns) run up and get killed immediately while I send over largely ineffective arrows. I might as well be hitting this guy with a wet noodle. Fast forward two hours (most big fights take about 2 hours), I've got the Cyclops down to nothing from running around reviving my pawns and doing the most repetitive exercise of my entire life. He finally falls like a tree and drops some junk that I will probably never use and respawns the next time that I reload the game. Was that rewarding? Was that fun?Update - am now playing through a New Game+, this is a reload of a character who completed the game. I am sick of inventory management and quests that have nothing to do with anything (bring some guy an herb beer). Combat is a button mashing nightmare and my dagger attacks keep ending with me facing the wrong way, pawns have zero AI - very lucky when a coordinated attack happens.

Where are the huge military bases where you sneak around and use all your skill to dodge guards?  Apparently not in this game.  Gameplay is basically the same as the first Solid title with some new and cool additions but on the other and a frustratingly impossible to aim with first-person mode.  Sound is pretty much dead on with a good score to boot.  Overall replay value, uh...err..there isn't any.  One time through and it's over, 12-15 hours long or rather 7-8, minus those cuts scenes.  Going back though to collect all the dog tags does not count for replay.  Where are the VR missions?  They sure as hell droned on about them in this monstrosity but they are not in this game and would really have upped the value of this game.  I had my hopes up for this one but I can only recommend you rent it or wait 2 weeks for people to figure out they did not really care for this game and pick it up used for [amount] less.",2,"Why Kojima,?

7838,130315,AC6LV5D2RKTIR,B002BSA2LQ,"Michigoon ""tech geek""","[10, 19]","Forza 3 does a lot of things right, but it's the things it does wrong that left me with a bitter impression.First off, what it does right:-An insane number of cars, over 400 in the box and tons more are downloadable (usually for a fee)-Lots of tracks, 100+ options in the box and more for download (again, usually for a price)-The best customization on consoles, including on-the-fly adjustments that can be made while testing the car, so you don't have to go back and forth between loading screens to test out adjustments-The livery editor is unmatched, letting you paint and decal your cars to a ridiculous degree- if you can dream it, you can build itWith all of this, you'd imagine this is a five-star game. The driving really is technically perfect, and the best simulation you can get on consoles. However, the downsides start to rear their head.First off, the game is totally soulless. 1,000 horsepower monster cars just drift forward, when they should be shaking your driver's teeth loose. The system fails to model the complex bumps and divots that real race tracks have, so the car just floats along. Before the developers patched in an update, your driver didn't even shift when using the first-person mode, the computerized hands just stayed glued to the wheels. This was okay in previous installations in the series since few games could manage that level of realism, but in the time since the last Forza many other titles (Project Gotham racing, GRID...) have better captured incredibly intense bumping and jarring and terror of driving a race car at speed. Driving a million-dollar supercar in Forza 3 is, frankly, just boring.Multiplayer is awful, and this affects the singleplayer game. In most singleplayer or ""career"" modes, you win a number of prize cars through the game for completing various challenges. Normally, you can resell these prize cars for a good chunk of change, in order to upgrade cars you want. Instead, the developers decided to integrate selling cars into the multiplayer experience, so you can only auction off cars to other people. Since everyone wins the same cars, you're basically stuck with whatever you get and it's much harder to earn money toward things you really want to do in game. The online racing is also awful. As an example, the developers also pulled support for playlists for anyone who wants to race sub-A-class cars, meaning online racing is basically limited to race-tuned and supercars against strangers, there's nothing catering to people who want to race regular stock cars in leagues, which is a massively popular demographic.And the grind. As mentioned, you can't resell prize cars for money, so you're stuck grinding away getting cash from race prizes. Races only really grant money if you finish in the top 3 and specifically in first place, so you'll basically have to win every single race to build money. A normal race might net you up to $20,000 of in-game cash, when there are cars that cost $20 million. That's 1,000 races (and you have to win every single one, while avoiding damage to your car). There are longer races that net more money, but then you could wind up spending literally hours to finish a single race, for only a fraction of the money that you need. It's basically impossible to net all the cars you're going to want, unless you're going to spend a ridiculous amount of time playing and manipulating the online auctions.The damage modeling is laughable. The developers did a great job modeling small bits of damage, like windshields cracking from impacts or bumpers crumpling from a hit, so things look impressive at a glance. However, you quickly learn that all damage is preset- if the front corner takes (x) damage, it will look like crumple effect (y). And if you take a big hit, prepare for the surprise. The front bumper of your car might crumple when you hit a wall, but the chassis will be fine even if you slam facefirst into concrete at 200mph. If you manage to flip your car, it rolls around like a children's toy, and you can hold the left stick to make your car roll itself back over like a turtle shaking its flippers to roll over. This is just plain stupid, and it looks ridiculous in game.So the final impression I was left with, is that that developers spent tens of millions of dollars scanning every lug nut on a car to ensure total accuracy, but then they let you roll your flipped car over with the flick of a magic wand. It's just... dumb. So much money and effort is spent on such a lifeless package. I'm totally underwhelmed by this entry in the series, even though I loved the previous installments.",1,"Love car sims, hate this game",1283990400,"09 9, 2010"

Unfortunately, it didn't live up to expectations, which part of it is because it wasn't the same people (believe it or not) that did Symphony of the Night (PSX).  Read on to see why it's a below average game:THE GOODFinally, Castlevania in 3-D!  Despite many shortcomings, the game does have some eerie music and a dark atmosphere, which are characteristic of a Castlevania game (at least the newer releases).  You can select between two characters (Carrie and Reinhart) that change the storyline somewhat.THE BADI was never a fan of the 64 controller and this is the one game where it hurt most.  The controls and gameplay were difficult at best, and normally I have a decent tolerance level for controls; Here's where I absolutely loathed it.  Getting your character to go where you want is quite a challenge for this game.  Also, the storyline, aside from the two characters' different (yet similar) paths, is really hollow at its core and doesn't add anything new to the Castlevania legacy.OVERALLNot recommended.  I advise renting the game only.  ONLY BUY IT IF YOU ARE A DIE-HARD N64 FAN.  Otherwise, I strongly recommend skipping it.  I'm a big Castlevania fan and I feel that this game does not do the series justice.  I noticed some people in their reviews that they liked this game over Bloodlines (Genesis); Why?!  Bloodlines had far better gameplay and replay value than this!  Perhaps it's because 90% of gamers today prefer graphics over gameplay, when it's GAMEPLAY that creates the game.",2,"Ugh, and that's a Castlevania fan's opinion!",1055548800,"06 14, 2003"

People say it was fun, it was cool, and it looked great. And it might have been all those things....but it wasn't enjoyable. In fact, it was hardly understandable. There was very little story to the actual game, and when it does rear it's ugly head, it's only strength is the graphics. The story is presented in such a way that every scene seems to be intentionally ambiguous, to the point where you begin to wonder if there's a large section of the game you may have missed where they actually explain the story rather than present more questions. No explanations are given for anything, short of 'there's a princess that needs saving and you're stuck with the job'. The voice acting is just horrible, and the game play isn't even all that fun.Much like the popular Onimusha series, this game features customizable weapons, the Diskarmors, each with different magical abilities and elemental alignments. There's even an optional dungeon nearly identical to Onimusha's Dark Realm, but I'd discovered it by accident, and found no reason to actually go through it. I beat the game within four days with no difficulty, and even after beating it I still didn't understand what was going on.If you're that drawn in to playing the game, look it up on Youtube or borrow it from a friend if you can first.

DragonBall Z Budokai Tenkaichi 1's story mode is the worst mode in the game and you have to play it in order to unlock new characters of course. It is basically a mission based story mode and it is very heavy on it's missions, for example: you have to face against Raditz as Goku in the Saiyan Saga but you have to ""Survive until time runs out"" in Tenkaichi 2 that doesn't matter because you can destroy Raditz all you want but here you actually have to let Raditz survive not you other wise it would show you a cutscene where it shows that you have won the fight but when you get sent back to the mission select screen you did not pass the mission. The game also changes the computer difficulty at random making some missions impossible to beat and you can not continue on until you beat the specific mission. Even though you can change the difficulty in the options menu it won't make a difference when you were doing so well in the last 20 missions and all of a sudden the enemy starts to attack you from every angle so that you can not escape it, why have a difficulty setting when the game chooses it for you. The Z-items are worthless, they are used as power-ups per mission instead of staying on the character in the mode. While that is a pain in the ass, there is training mode where you can freely beat the living snot out of your opponents without any worry of missions although you have to keep going back and forth in selection screens to change say: Goku to Super Saiyan 3 Goku.

We lose the load screens which indeed sucked, but we lose SO much more.

Those faces on the cover were generated on Photoshop, and no way they were a result from the game.The jobs and needs were actually improved, but they are implemented on a game that lacks all that which made the previous ones great. The Sims seem more stupid and reluctant to follow directions. The number of objects is really small and the expressions and body language are the same from Sims 2 but the difference in color and animation only serves to remind you of what you aren't playing.  The greater loses are with the female Sims they never look feminine at all. It is very strange.That and some crashes made me place the game back on the shelf.

I think this frame rate stuff might have something to do with why they has pre rendered cut scenes. I'm sure this will be fixed in a patch but it's just part of the bigger problem with the video game industry right now, the ship it when it's not done and fix it with a patch crap.The collector's edition is both neat and bad. The statue is huge. When unpacking the poster, they have the Batman logo embedded in the styrofoam! But the statue is too big for my liking honestly. I almost have no place to put it. The TVs behind the Joker are nothing like the promo stuff. Completely different. They are suppose to light up but are poorly lit and are a blur of purple crap. One can barely make out what is on the screen. The floor piece is coming off or wasn't secured to behind with. And there are posters/fliers on desk and floor, they should have just been printed on the statue instead of and individual piece that they glued on. That's just how I would have built the statue but there might be reasons for why it was done the way it was. Over all, the statue has its nice details but the quality fluctuates. There is a hidden compartment with a spoiler bag. Something that you are suppose to open after you finish the game. I think that's a really cool idea! I can't wait to get there! The 2 evidence bags are really cool too, I like that it keeps me from opening it by labeling it as evidence. What would I really do with some poker chip and a tooth/claw?Now when I saw this collector's edition, I was a little overwhelmed with all the crap in it. I wanted the cool statue, the art book and the game, of course. The map, stencil, photo, bat wing thing, contracts, wanted poster and assassin's files. It was just annoying at that point.

It isn't - in fact it is astoundingly bad.There are some major issues:First the bad plot that has almost nothing to do with the movie. Do you remember Brock getting fired because he dressed up like black Spiderman and mugged people? How about MJ breaking up with Peter because he got nasty and knocked over a wine glass? What about Sandman's kid locked in the trunk of the taxi that MJ was dangling from at the end? I would like to know if Activision was simply not told the majority of the plot or if they just decided to kind of made it up as they went along?Second the short length. After long side missions I beat the game in 7 hours. I bet you could finish the game in less than 5 without the side missions. They also cut several storylines from the PS2 version like Kingpin, Rhino, and Scorpion.Third, it looks like they replaced the actors with zombies. Mary Jane looks the worst. Seriously though, this game is a textbook example of the uncanny valley.Fourth the controls suck. There is a slight delay in your attacks, so combat is hard to get used to. Also they removed many of the fun moves fromSpider-Man 2.There are also tons of glitches. I loved it when in a mission a guy decided to stand on my shoulders, or get carried in the air slightly to the left of me. Also you can frequently fail a mission because all of these glitches.Finally the amount of loading is ridiculous. For example if you have just completed a mission this is what will happen. First loading, then text says ""Mission passed!"" followed by more loading. You get a few XP then loading...again. Five second cut scene. You guessed it - more loading.There is some good in the game. Bruce Cambell as usual is a top notch narrator. Also the gang wars are an improvement on 2 and actually makes it seem like what you do positively affects the city.In the end this is a depressingly bad game.Spider-Man 2was infinitely better.

It gets uncomfortable after awhile with my arms holding a dualshock 3 over my stomach. This controller allows them to rest on either side of me. You can also set this controller to the same input as your dualshock Eg. 1. That way you can have a dualshock in your right hand and the fragchuck in your left. I love the ""fragchuck"". It fits well in hand and everything for the left hand is there, plus motion sensitivity, macros, rapid fire, and more! Could pack 2-3 more buttons in, though.The mouse feels good, the buttons take a little getting used to, but are intuitive and easy to adapt to. The mous pad is good too. However, it's a little too big for me and I have good sized hands - 7 inches from my middle finger to the bottom of my palm. Because of the shape, It actually fits better in my left hand than my right, of course then the buttons are imposable to use. I could have gotton used to the size but didn't want to since it wasen't very compatable with some of my games (See details section below).There is a lot of disinformation surrounding this product. There are a lot of positive reviews from people playing Calld of Duty (Newer ones) and a lot of bad reviews calling it a ""rip off"".  Aparently compatbility is hit or miss since PS3 was not made for a mouse and the fragfx shark has to emulate a thumb stick. To be fair to Splitfish they made a niche product, great for some of todays most popular games, but it's game manufacturers that are not making their titles compatible with Splitfish controllers. But then, why should they? It is a 3rd party controller. Also, why would Sony make the PS3 compatable with mice when most console gamers like the dualshock 3? I should add that some users don't like to use mice and the only refuge they have from the advantage a mouse gives users is on a console.Pros:- The Concept is sound- Wireless, no lag- The design looks sweet- The ""fragchuck"" is almost perfect!- Great Battery life- Works with some F.P.S. gamesCons:- Price!!!- Dosen't work with some F.P.S. games- PS3 Games were ment for Dualshock controllers- 3rd parties don't get much support from developers- OK as an optical mouse (Not great, Not laser)- Mouse is a little too big in my opinion- Disinformation about itTHE BOTTOM LINE: DOES IT WORK, AND IS IT WORTH $89?- Yes and no to both points! It works with some games and not with others. It may be worth it if your game is supported, you get past the learning curve, and you really want to take your ""hard core"" gameing up a level, or if you seriously want to get into PC gaming without the keboard. Otherwise, it's not for you and you will end up unsatisfied. I suggest you keep everything, and thouroughly test out all your games as soon as you get it, then you can get a refund if it does not meet your expectations.Price I would consider keeping it for (Opinion):- $34.99Price I would buy the Fragchuck alone (Opinion):- $29.99DETAILS:There was no combination of ingame look sensitivity and ""dead zone"" sensitivity that removed diagonal ""staircasing"" without making tracking too slow for most of the games I've tested. I saw reviews that mentioned the same thing before I purchased. I decided to give it a try anyway. To their defence, I tried evey combination of dead zone to ingame look sensitivity in the games below with limited success.Homefront (Demo):- Staircased at dead zones of 0-5 and required too much mouse tracking with 6-9. 6.5 was almost workable except it required me to repeatedly pick up the mouse and reset it to look around. Was less efiecient than the dualshock.Call of Duty: Classic- Same as aboave, but worse.Call of Duty: Black Ops (Demo)- Works really well but seems to move up/Down slower than lept/right. No staircasing/jittering with ingame sensitvity at max (Insane) and deadzone = 3. Workable but will take some getting used to. Recommended for this game but it's not perfect.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (Demo)- Same as black ops aboave. Abviously, these are the game it was intended for.Killzone 2 (Demo):- I was able to resolve staircasing and jittering. Requires maximum ingame sensitivity and a deadzone of 4. Too slow of movement, mouse has to be picked up and drageed all over in this one. Not recomended.Killzone 3 (Demo):- Better than above but not as good as COD:MW2 or black ops. It is still too slow. too much mouse tracking.Battlefield 1943:- No staircasing. I needed a dead zone of about 3 to get rid of the jittery/jumping when trying to ""pixle point"" at an object. Although better, I found tracking was still too slow/difficult to play with. Would take some getting used to. It makes driving vehicals or flying extreemly difficult, if not imposable.Infamous:- Works well enough to play. Better feel than the dualshock but jittery/staircasing not completly gone.PC USERS:When set as a mouse it is fine, sweet to have four extra buttons! Not as good as my logetech MX 5000 laser mouse but  it tracks as well as an optical (A cheap one). Also, since I was a console gamer before PC, I tried this on a game I have always dreamed of having a ""fragchuck"" for...The Descent series. Although windows 7 x64 recognizes it as a gamepad and all of the buttons/analog stick work, it would not recognize the anolog or mouse movement in Descent 1. In Descent 2 this problem is fixed but the mouse has dead zone issues, and when that is ajusted it's too slow, requires too much movement, and is'nt as accurate as my MX5000 laser (Not even close). So, it was esentially useless. Too bad! Fine, I can just use the MX5000 instead by choosing the mouse and joystick option. Worked perfect, very addicting. I set drop bombs to the motion sensative melee and afterburners to the joystick button (L3)! That is sweet and there are 10 buttons on the fragchuck, if you count L3 and the D-Pad, to assign functions to. They could have packed 2-3 more buttons in though. I also, tested a few other FPS games (Older School) that did not work to my satisfaction. Bottom line: if your game supports joystick and mouse operation in tandom (and gives you complete control over button reassignments) then it ""might"" work like you want it to, otherwise it's a crap shoot. Don't know about newer games like far cry, fallout, and etc.Note:I really wanted it to work for me and to give it a fair review. I even pulled it back out of the return box to test it agian on a few titles I forgot about, just to make sure I wanted to return it. No go. Given the range of experiance I got out of it and the problems I was able to almost resolve, I would say my unit was not defective. It just almost works. Maybe it will work better for the games you want it for. Good Luck.PS:that guy on youtube (zDD) is displayed prominantly on the packaging and endorsed by Splitfish. Not to say his videos are fake, but his incentive is to paint the product in a positive light. Therefore he's not going to post a video showing what games it doesn't work in! A one sided story is at best a half-truth. So, don't be supprised if your experiance is different form his.",3,I will try to give this item a fair review..,1315612800,"09 10, 2011"

The game plays similar to Baulder's Gate or Norrath though I would say gameplay wise the battle system is not as good.There are hundreds of quests, and just about everyone in the game you can talk to. You can even hear other townspeople talking while you are just standing around. There are lots of funny quotes that you can read on tombstones as well as famous quotes, they really put a lot of time into this.Some notes:-There is no pause. If you want to check your inventory, be careful you (or 2nd player) could be getting attacked and you wouldn't know it. Everything is real time.-2 player on the same console do not share inventory screens. You have to view yours, then when you are done the 2nd play can view theirs. This really drags the pace from slow to terribly slow.-it is not really a button masher as your player locks onto an enemy and you hold the button down while it attacks. Sometimes it'll look like it is attacking but it's missing, other times you try to change buttons to a different weapon and it won't work. Other times it'll lock on an enemy that's not even on the screen meanwhile the beast right in front of you is killing you! (mostly on range attacks)-Instruction manual tells you very little. There is no strategy guide. Be prepared to learn as you go. Or read up on the Sacred 2 forums for help and advice.- All text is 100% UNREADABLE in the game if you own a CRT Television. I have a 32"" TV and couldn't read anything so I actually had to buy a small LCD monitor to hook my Xbox into just to play this game.- There are tons and tons of armor, weapons, magics and combinations. Much like other games of its type you loot and you get lots of goodies.- Dungeons are big and full of rats (at least early on). I mean you'll fight more rats than you can imagine to the point it gets a little annoying.- You can mount horses and even fight while riding.- Side quests can get monotonous. 20 hours in and still haven't fought a boss.Now almost hours in I change my ratings.Fun = 4 starsOverall = 4 starsAs many faults as I can find in this game there is a strong addictive quality to it that makes you want to play all the time.

However, if you just like playing the games, I honestly must say for you to pass this up.  For reasons that are pretty obvious.For one, everything GOOD about the Gameboy Micro, can easily be seen in the GBA SP.  This screen is backlit and easily fits in your pocket, and plays GBA games.  Alright, that's fair enough.  But come on?  The GBA SP was just like that.  With the GBA SP there was a backlight with a rechargable battery, and if you folded it down then it went into your pocket with no problems at all.  I do like all the different custom face plates though.  They're easy to use and don't leave any of that sticky residue.The GBA Micro is, of course, for those who do not already have a GBA of any kind.  If you don't have a GBA, go with the SP.  And let me explain why:1. You cannot protect the screen of your GBA micro: If you stick it in your pocket, you'll pull it out only to see several scratches on the screen.  Needless to say this is a big problem.  With the SP's fold down LCD Screen, you could easily protect it.2. The Screen is Actually Smaller: This is true too.  The screen is smaller and the games are not properly brought down to scale.  It's very annoying!3. You can't play older Gameboy games and Gameboy color games: The same thing plagued the DS, but the DS I could live with.  This I cannot.  Part of the reason I still have my GBA SP is so I can play older Gameboy games.  You can't do that with the Micro.4. The list price is too high: I don't know about you, but I certainly don't want to spend one hundred bucks on this when the SP has more to offer in terms of quality.  The SP is cheaper and easier to work with.  With the hand-held console war advanced off to the PSP and DS, paying one-hundred dollars for this is almost shady.Overall: If you are someone looking for a decent Gameboy system, get the SP.

11317,97164,A1GJ7UYEX30TPU,B000ZK695U,Geomancer,"[1, 3]","I have recently completed the game so I feel like I can now give a good review on my opinion of White Knight Chronicles.Story:This is not a fantastic story. It has the clich&eacute; save the princess as the overall plot line, something we've all seen since the beginnings of gaming (Mario anyone?) however just because it has been used, over, and over, and over again does not mean it is also horrible. Overall I didn't not find the story to be terrible, just not very original. I won't say any more about the story itself so I can avoid giving spoilers. I'll include voice acting here, I don't find this to be bad at all. I'm happy with the voices.Combat:This is a real time combat system. People confuse it with turn-based, which it is not. No one takes turns, if your action gauge fills up and you don't press anything, the action keeps going and does not wait for you to 'take your turn' like in a true turn based game. That said, the combat in this game is slower than your typical 'action' game. It really plays out like an MMORPG for those who have played those games. There is a circle in the lower right hand corner of the screen that must completely draw before you can take an action. Your weapon and armor determine how fast that fills. A 2-hand weapon and heavy armor will make it move very slow, light armor and a 1-hand weapon will make it go faster. There is also a haste type spell that can increase the speed further. Overall combat is very easy. most monsters will take 1-3 hits to kill. The large monsters will take a lot longer to kill, but their damage output is easily manageable. The games difficulty is very easy. A big negative that becomes more and more annoying as you progress is monsters can attack you in melee when they are a long, long ways from you. Boars will bite you when they are still 15 feet away... I've seen this in games like FFXII but it is worse in WKC.Graphics:A lot of people have complained about these, but for me I think they looked pretty decent. Certainly not the best I've seen, but they ARE better than a PS2 game. Keep in mind this is a JRPG, don't expect characters to look life like. JRPGs typically have an art style to them, and WKC is no different. I would rate the graphics to be average. The cut scenes are mostly all rendered using the in game engine. This is because all of your characters change appearance depending on what gear you have on them, all the way down to capes, glasses, and rings. That makes pre-rendered CGI impossible. There are a couple cut scenes that exclude your avatar that have higher quality rendering.Sound:I never have much to say on sound, I'll say average here. Some music is pretty good, others forgetful. The one annoying thing I've encountered is your party talks constantly as you walk around, often times what they say gets very repetitive and old.Customization:Awesome, awesome, awesome. Your characters have 8 skill trees with about 50 skills in each of them, lots of things to do here. Weapons can be enhanced several levels to make them more powerful, along with your armor. There is an in depth crafting system (called binding) that will keep you playing at the end of the game to get the very best. There is also the Georama which is where you can create your own little village. You can place buildings any way you like and even add it the mundane items like boxes or pots. You are limited to the square footage of where you can place items though. This can be upgraded over time by spending in came currency to increase the space you have to build. The Georama provides a meeting place for online play and can also be used to buy crafting items if you specialize your town correctly. There is also the ability of changing how your character physically looks by changing their gear as I mentioned earlier in the graphics section.Online:There are 50 quests you can play online, they are your typical MMORPG style of quests. Kill X monsters, get Y item, kill Z boss, or talk to so and so person. Most quests have a 1 hour time limit they must be completed in, however typically these quests are far quicker than that. Some can be as quick as 3 minutes, others more like 30 minutes. It really depends on if your party focuses on the objective or spends the time to kill every single thing between you and the objective. Online play is fun, easy to join, and necessary if you want to obtain every item in the game. The Geonet offers a place for you to post your in game status. You can make blog style posts, post pictures you can take in the game, there is a message board, and you can create Georama rooms to meet up with people to start quests.Overall:Pros:+Character Customization (from creating your avatar to the entire skill tree)+Characters change looks depending on what they are wearing+Item Customization+Georama (this thing is cool really, really fun to play with but expensive)+Slower combat (this is a plus for me, I don't like button mashers)+Huge maps+Towns are a single zone, no zoning when you enter a store or enter a different section of the city (with the exception of Greede which is a very, very large city on the back of an even larger turtle).Neutral:GraphicsSoundStoryStupid DLC (micro transactions for georama parts, and $5 to change how your avatar looks? Stupid, but your choice to buy. You are not forced.)Negatives:-Short (around 20 hours for main story only, max. You'll spend a hundred or more hours if you try to platinum the game though, it requires a lot of grinding to get)-Monster distance issue (they attack you in melee from extreme distances)-Annoying party chatterOverall I give this game 4 out of 5 stars. It is not a perfect 5, but it is a lot of fun. It offers far more than the average RPG with the customization and crafting system, online play, and the Georama.

Not worth more than 25 dollars though.There are so many annoyances and too many to list. Here are some.1.

When you finish a game and go right into another one, you have to do it all over again.2. The person who pressed start on their controller is the one who sets up the game. So, the order of P1, P2, etc. is not determined by the order of your controller connection to the console. You pretty much had to guess who was who when putting in the names.3.

Despite being developed by RPG giant Squaresoft, Xenogears didn't possess the hype necessary to pull me in.  I was too caught up in other franchises to pay the Xeno universe much notice.However, all that changed the first hour I was into Xenosaga.  85 game hours later (and just 30 minutes ago) I finished it.  Now I'm hooked and very much interested in what Xenogears was all about.What drew me into Xenosaga wasn't the convincing, futuristic atmosphere.  It wasn't the slick graphics and impressive battle animations.  It wasn't the superb music and sound effects.  No, it was the outstanding story and characters.  These two aspects unfold in highly entertaining cinema scenes packed with perfect amounts of humor and drama.  They do a good job of keeping you interested in the characters, as well as the plot.  They're so professionally done you'd swear you're watching a movie, not a game.And therein lies one problem.  As you've no doubt heard, Xenosaga holds the record for longest and most frequent cutscenes in any game...ever.  I, for one, never had a problem with Xenosaga's cutscenes.  In fact, they were the reason for me to keep playing!  Thankfully, there is a feature to skip any cinema scene at any time, so no one can complain there.If you like complex customization options you'll love Xenosaga's menu system.  At first glance it's intimidating, but spend some time going through it and you'll begin to see how things work.  That's also true with the battle system, which may not be what most RPG players are used to.All of the music in Xenosaga is done by a full symphony orchestra, and it sounds stellar.  I just wish there was more of it.  And I wish it wasn't reused so often.  The best example of this is the battle music, which never changes, not even for boss fights (except for the final battle).Sound effects are perfect throughout the game.  Battles are riddled with satisfying impact sounds.  Footsteps sound appropriate to whomever is walking around the environment.  It's all top notch.The only non-graphic/sound complaint I have has to do with the best part about Xenosaga: the cutscenes.  I would have liked to see the characters' mouths move in synch with the English voices.  It's distracting but forgivable.Be prepared for plenty of unanswered questions by the game's end.  The title Xenosaga is accurate.  Seeing as how there's going to be six-seven parts, this is one ambitious game series.

6574,190328,A1B4VTD0FVD6OV,B0056WJA6M,D.G.M.,"[5, 5]","This is a game I was eagerly waiting on for quite some time after beating the first game. Now that I've beaten it, I can definitely say it was almost everything I had hoped it would be. This sequel actually takes place during the 100 year ""intermission"" of the first Darksiders where War is imprisoned by the Charred Council after he (allegedly) kick-started the Apocalypse too early, which caused all hell to literally break loose on Earth, completely obliterating the human race and turning the world into a demonic paradise. War's elder brother, Death, rightly believes his younger brother to be innocent. The game opens with Death journeying to the lair of the mysterious being known as the Crowfather, with the hopes of finding out from him how to restore the human race and effectively erase War's (alleged) crime. This opening mission serves as a tutorial, where we immediately see some of the game's improvements over its predecessor. First off, Death already has full access to his own trusted steed, Despair, while War didn't get his horse back until just past the first game's halfway point. Death also has his guiding crow, Dust, flying nearby him at all times to show him where he needs to go. When fighting enemies, Death moves and dodges much more fluidly than his younger brother before him, and although he can't block enemy attacks, he doesn't really need to. After facing off against several standard grunts and a rather large sub-boss, Death meets up with the Crowfather and things kind of go south for the Horseman. An interesting battle ensues (the details of which I won't spoil) and the Crowfather ends up dead, while Death is injured and accidentally transported to the heavily Lord of the Rings-inspired domain of the Forge Lands, the homeworld of the Makers (the race that Ulthane is part of).Death is then told where he must go to continue his journey to exonerate his brother by an old and wise Maker, so he sets off on his adventure. He will visit 4 different worlds of varying size ranging from decaying dead kingdoms, bright and shining heavenly cities, and hellish realms of fire and brimstone, each with their own collections of dungeons, enemies, missions, etc. The gameplay is very much like the kind experienced in the first game, with the combat being very similar to that in God of War, as well as the dungeon exploration and large environments of the Legend of Zelda series. A new addition to the formula is improved platforming and environmental traversal reminiscent of the more recent Prince of Persia games. Death can wall run, climb on posts and wooden beams, and jump back and forth between adjacent walls to get to normally out of reach areas. Even the deadly substance known as Corruption is practically yanked out of the 2008 Prince of Persia game and given a somewhat different role and purpose in the story for Darksiders II. As if that wasn't enough of an homage, Death can save himself from falls by transforming into his Reaper Form and dashing himself back to the nearest stable ground (although these falls still count as ""environmental deaths"").One big improvement this game has over its predecessor are its much more in-depth RPG elements. Death has access to hundreds of different weapons to carve up his enemies with. His primary weapons are, of course, scythes, which he uses to great effect. His secondary weapons fall into two main categories: larger, two-handed weapons (hammers, maces, and glaives) and gloved weapons (gauntlets, bucklers, and claws). There are hundreds of variations to these weapons, with many of them offering certain advantages like elemental damage, draining health and wrath (magic) from enemies, and increased chances of landing critical strikes. Certain ""possessed"" weapons can be upgraded by feeding/sacrificing other unneeded weapons and armor to them to further increase their effectiveness. Many different types of armor and talismans can be equipped by Death with their own advantages in increasing his strength, defense, health, wrath, resistance to magic, etc. All these things can be found as loot drops from defeated enemies, in chests littering the environment, or purchased from several different merchants using the form of currency called gilt. More advanced combat moves tied to Death's many weapons can also be purchased from certain merchants. In addition, Death gains newer abilities and sub-weapons as the game progresses: the powerful Redemption revolver, the Deathgrip, which allows him to grab distant grapple points and enemies, his own version of the Voidwalker (which later on gets an upgrade that involves time manipulation), and Soul Splitter, which basically allows Death to be in two places at once. Many of the game's more challenging and interesting puzzles revolve around using these new abilities to advance or find hidden items.But wait, there's more. As Death levels up, he can distribute a point towards a multitude of additional abilities that are accessible in a new skill tree. The Harbinger portion of the skill tree is dedicated to special abilities tied to Death's scythe attacks, such as performing a teleport slash on distant enemies or temporarily increasing his physical attack power. The Necromancer portion of the skill tree focuses on Death's magic attacks, which include the ability to summon ghouls or a flock of crows to attack his enemies for him, or surrounding himself with a magic shield to temporarily increase his defense. More abilities can be unlocked or upgraded as Death continues to level up. Then there's Death's Reaper Form, which more closely resembles his more familiar Grim Reaper incarnation where he is decked out in a cloak and hood and wields an extra large scythe. Functioning very much like War's Chaos Form in the first game, Death can temporarily transform into this state after filling up his Reaper meter and devastate any nearby enemies. All these different abilities and sub-weapons can be accessed through a weapon wheel which pauses the action or mapped to specific button combinations for immediate use.Unlike the first game, Darksiders II boasts a hefty number of side missions which can be completed at your leisure alongside the main mission. These include hunting down specific enemies and hidden collectibles, as well as visiting optional dungeons and normally encountering optional boss battles in the process. Due to the much less linear design of this game, it's very possible to get to one of these optional dungeons a little too early, only to encounter an obstacle that can only be bypassed after acquiring a specific ability (such as the Voidwalker or Soul Splitter) or even run into enemies and bosses who are at higher levels than Death. I once found myself nearly getting killed by unusually strong regular enemies in a particular optional dungeon, so I left the dungeon for the time being. When I returned after leveling up a couple of times, I was able to slaughter those same tough enemies more easily, as well as the boss who awaited at the end of the dungeon. I liked this new non-linear approach to gameplay, it gave the game a more organic and adventurous feel to it. However, with regards to the many hidden collectibles to be found in this game, some of them were quite the chore to locate. Most can easily be found just with a little effort, but a fair number are VERY well hidden, to the point where a couple of them are literally invisible. I had an easier time finding Riddler trophies in the Batman games, let's just leave it at that. The ability to fast travel between discovered locations greatly helps to minimize the already time consuming process of finding collectibles and completing other missions.The many different enemies Death faces include Corrupted constructs, undead warriors, Corrupted angels, demons, and other freaks of nature. A fair number of them offer greater challenges than the noticeably easier enemies in the first game, although almost none of them reach the level of incredibly frustrating (except one particular optional boss). On the flip side, most of the enemies and bosses in this game are typically beaten simply by dodging their attacks and then striking back when they're exposed. The more puzzle-based types of bosses from the first game are noticeably lacking in Darksiders II, with only a few notable exceptions. So, while Darksiders II is an improvement over the first Darksiders in most areas, it is lacking in other aspects, aside from the less puzzle-based enemies. The optional arena battle known as the Crucible has Death face wave after wave of increasingly tough enemies. Most gamers will find themselves more than sufficiently challenged by this addition to the Darksiders games. I myself found it to be a lot of fun, as well as occasionally super difficult. Unfortunately, the final rounds of the Crucible can only be accessed after Death has reached a high enough level, which in turn can only be done by starting the game a second time in New Game +. As much as I love videogames, I've never really been one to go the New Game + route and play a game twice in a row. Simply too redundant. I know this isn't an issue with most gamers, but I for one was a little disappointed that I couldn't complete the Crucible in just one playthrough of this game. Forcing someone to play the game twice in order to complete everything it has to offer was not the right way to go in my opinion. I'm just glad these optional arena battles don't affect the game's story.Speaking of which, the story for this game is simply not as interesting or cinematically grasping as the one that came before it, although it's certainly not bad either. For one thing, Death himself is not all that different from his younger brother War, aside from being somewhat more humorous in a snide way. The two of them share a very similar sense of honor and duty, although that's not really a bad thing. They're both cool characters by their own rights. Also, while the cast of characters in this game is much larger compared to that of the first, most of the characters Death speaks to normally just provide him with a list of chores and favors for him to do in exchange for them helping him complete his journey. Amusingly, Death himself makes a comment early in the game about how he seems to be doing all the work while everyone else just stands around. The pacing of the missions is also rather drawn out. Between the many fetch quests and favors Death undertakes in both the main and side missions, I actually forgot once or twice exactly what the purpose of Death's journey was. Still, a fair number of the missions Death goes on provide some genuinely fun and addicting gameplay moments. One particular mission where Death uses an angelic cannon to shoot his way through swarms of undead creatures and demons in the destroyed, rain soaked streets of Earth is definitely one of this game's high points. Unfortunately, the story simply never reaches the same level of epic satisfaction achieved towards the later moments of the first game. Even the ending for this game was disappointingly abrupt and rather unsatisfying in how it ties in with the first game's ending. This is further compounded by the fact that the final boss battle was one of the easiest battles in the entire game. However, the extra scene after the end credits hints at a possibly (and hopefully) more epic true sequel that shows what will happen further down the line with the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Despite the somewhat weaker story, Darksiders II is a great improvement over the first game in terms of providing larger environments, more challenging enemies and puzzles, and just more addicting and fun gameplay overall. Don't miss out on this game, especially if you enjoyed the first one.**Update**This next part is dedicated to the 3 DLCs for Darksiders II: Argul's Tomb, The Abyssal Forge, and The Demon Lord Belial. I'll get right to the point here: those hoping for something new or different in these DLCs will be sorely disappointed since all three DLCs have the same exact type of gameplay present in the main game of Darksiders II with regards to combat and puzzles. There are some new weapons and armor for Death to use, but that's it; everything else remains the same. However, this may not be such a bad thing for those gamers who greatly enjoyed playing the main game since the DLCs all offer the same addicting combat and a fair number of challenging puzzles. Having said that, I must warn those of you who have still not played these DLCs: freezing issues are a SERIOUS PROBLEM. Argul's Tomb runs fine, but The Abyssal Forge and The Demon Lord Belial are basically broken. Apparently, the games freeze at certain moments when performing autosaves or even if you do a manual save. After checking for more info online on how to fix this problem, I was able to bypass these freezing issues (to a certain degree) by emptying Death's inventory of weapons and armor to the point where he only has one set of scythes, one secondary weapon, and one full set of armor left. Having to get rid of so many cool weapons just to progress in these games was truly annoying, to say the least.However, despite dwindling Death's collection of weapons down to almost nothing, The Demon Lord Belial still freezes on me and I was unable to complete it, so now I am forced to see the ending on Youtube. The best word to describe this nonsense: ""infuriating."" We gamers should not have to put up with these kinds of issues in games that we paid good money for. THQ and Vigil really dropped the ball on this one. So, in short, these 3 DLCs aren't what most of us would consider as ""must owns"", but they're still fun for fans of the series. However, due to the freezing issues, I strongly suggest that all gamers stay clear of The Abyssal Forge and The Demon Lord Belial until a patch is released.......IF a patch is ever released. If you're one of those fans who live and breathe for Darksiders and simply MUST play these DLCs, then stick to playing Argul's Tomb, which is the only DLC that is free of freezing issues, plus it's also noticeably longer than the other two broken games.",4,"The time for War is over, now prepare for Death",1347667200,"09 15, 2012"

However, Pokemon Black and Pokemon White will not be able to utilize nostalgia for long.  Black and White will appeal to many avid fans as it has quite a bit to offer, but others should keep clear from the game's lack of major innovation. [Note that this review may contain some spoilers!]First off the story is very typical.  There has, however, been an injection of a unique plot, revolving around ideals (""liberation of Pokemon"") versus truth (""experiences with Pokemon"").  The story does not have very memorable characters and their character is shallow at best.Black and White offers a whole new line of Pokemon.  All Pokemon prior to post-game quests are brand-new: none of them are pre-evolution ""baby"" Pokemon, or evolutions of prior Pokemon.  Beating the game unlocks in-game access to previous Pokemon and the Global Trade System allows Pokemon to be traded at a international scale.Black and White has also updated their mechanics.  These are very minor such as new breeding mechanisms and new battle-styles.  New to Pokemon are the Triple-Battles and Rotation Battles.  They offer a new experience in battling Pokemon, but it will be as or a tad-more exciting than the double-battles.There are some aesthetic changes, for example Pokemon sprites during battles are no longer static.  The camera also pans during battle, and may rotate when entering or exiting certain buildings, caves, forests, etc.  The soundtrack provides great music, but is no more distinct or unique than past Pokemon games.This game has provided myself, a Pokemon fan (though no extreme enthusiast), many hours of fun.  The lack of innovations has been pushing me to be less attached to the franchise, though I continue to purchase the games due to nostalgia and the classic Pokemon formula which many still enjoy today, new fans and old.",3,"Will Entice Pokemon Fans, Others Beware",1302480000,"04 11, 2011"

Pathetic on a 2005 title.  You can play 20 minutes, looking for some bizarre thing that they hid in the game, and get killed at the last minute.  Another 20 minutes playing the same thing again.  Argh..  I thought we were past that years ago. F5 guys, F5.Then there's the controls.  The book tells you very little about what to do in the game.  I wandered around for 6 or 7 sections of the game not knowing what to do with the darn scanner.  Also, there seems to be a total lack of health when you need it most, and an abundance when you don't need it.  Didn't the developers play this thing before they shipped it?  Totally wierd.  And there are so many cut scenes and cinematics, its hard to get into the rythm.And then the most troubling thing.  I love these FPS games, Far Cry, Doom 3, Half Life 2, etc.  Play them all.  But Area 51, I find it very hard to see where I am.  The action is pretty wierd, which is ok (it is a fictional game after all), but because of how murky the controls are, and how wide the field of vision of the character is, I end up with a headache trying to see where I am half the time.  Its hard to know where the shots are coming from, and where the enemy is.  Its hard to describe, but the field of vision is just lousy.  And for a First Person game, thats indeed bad.All in all, very disappointing.  I can see why it didn't to that well.  Its klunky, has poor playability, and its hard to see whats going on.

You start off the game with two friends beside you. Your time is basically spent jumping from roof to roof and to make it even more difficult there is no map that tells you where to go so you're sometimes left wandering around trying to find out where to go next. You're also sometimes left struggling to see where you're going when scaling and jumping from walls.I would also expect that in  a shooter game like this you would be able to take cover but it is almost impossible to take cover in this game. Your friends  most always end up dying and lay on the ground crouched(like your GOW buddies)until you revive them.I'd suggest renting this or wait until the price drops tremendously before picking this up.,2,Frustrating and doesn't live up to it's hype!!,1243468800,"05 28, 2009"

If I have the system, I purchase the game within a few days or weeks of it's release. Sure the fundamentals of the game are the same, but generally there's enough new additions to the game to make the new purchases all worthwhile.With that in mind, I was eager to pick up City Folk. I'd loved the stuff that had come out on the GameCube & the DS, so I figured that I'd fall just as much in love with the Wii version. Well... after playing it off & on, I came to one conclusion: while the game was interesting, it was just much more fun to play this on the DS & GameCube. Granted, this version has a few new tricks such as being able to go to the city & a few new characters to meet. But there were just a few things that I thought got in the way of gameplay.It was strange getting used to playing with the new remote of the Wii. It made it a lot harder to position my character to move things about in the house or pick up or use my tools. After a while practice made it easier, but it was still a pain to get used to. The same thing goes for writing letters- letter writing is sort of a dull task to do now.The worst thing I've come in contact with so far though, is that the grass gets worn down depending on how frequently your character walks across it. If you were to run across the grass, it'll wear it down even faster. Since there's no quick & easy way to get the grass BACK, this makes for a huge pain- especially since there's stuff in the game that's grass dependent. I can understand that this is to make the game more realistic, but it's just something that is pretty much a pain in the tuckus. You can supposedly plant lots of flowers that will help the grass come back, but come on... not all players want to spend hours maintaining their towns- they want to PLAY! (My house is a great example of that- my mom & sister don't mind spending time maintaining everything, but my niece & I just want to get out there & play around.)Overall, this is something I'd recommend for most AC fans. For the newbies, this game will be illuminating- they'll more than likely love it. For the AC fans though, we won't find much new stuff here. It'll be mostly for the novelties.",3,"City is fun, but otherwise not really anything new here",1257897600,"11 11, 2009"

The hero engine that Bioware/Electronic Arts chose to use does not have the horsepower needed for large scale gameplay like Wintergrasp in World of Warcraft. This is evident by the enormous lag in the Fleet Stations. This results in small groups for raiding and extremely limited Player versus Player (PvP) combat and very long loading times on most of the planets. Get used to staring at a loading screen a lot in SWTOR.Bioware/EA are also very biased in favor of Force Users (Jedi and Sith) which is evident by the lack of balance between Force users and non-force users. To phrase it like us gamers do, the non-force users get pounded by the nerf stick much, much more than the force users do. Plus, about 80% of the gear dropped from NPC chars are for force users, which makes gearing up say a Trooper char from drops much more difficult than for the force users. Hell, on class missions for non force users the bosses drop gear for force users! And none of the Troopers, Smugglers, Bounty Hunters, or Sith Warriors even have companions that can use them.The Player versus Player combat (PvP) is limited to warzones, period! There is no meaningful PvP. No objectives to capture, defend, or re-capture. Just 4 warzones that get boring very quickly. And the stuns, roots, snares, and knockbacks in what passes for PvP in this game are insane. You can be chain stunned until you're killed in PvP combat without ever having a chance to fight. There have been numerous requests on the SWTOR forums to fix this, like in having damage break stuns but Bio/EA is ignoring this.Did I mention that it's also a major money sink? EVERYTHING costs enormous amounts of credits, the worst I've seen in any MMO. By the time you hit level 50 you're spending hours of gametime just farming money to pay for the insanely high costs you have.Bio/EA has made many promises for game improvements that have yet to happen, and most likely never will. All we get is fluff that adds nothing to the game and usually costs huge amounts of credits.Anyway, I only play every now and then anymore due to the reasons stated above and may just save myself $15 a month and cancel unless Bio/EA pull their fingers out and improve this game. And there's much that can be done to improve it but I dont believe that Bio/EA will do anything solid.Edit; I did cancel my subscription to this lame game. Bioware/EA is doing NOTHING except milk this for every buck they can squeeze out of Star Wars fans. Hell, anything Electronic Arts gets it's fingers into is either junk or rapidly deteriorates into junk!

I have no problem progressing through the Wrestlemania era to unlock new characters and items but everybody who had mentioned about the AI being super difficult even when the settings are adjusted are correct.A good example is Wrestlemania XII Iron man match with Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart, you can beat up the Hitman and dominate the match and the game automatically triggers "" Wrestlemania moments"" to mimic the actual match, fine but once the cut scene completes, there you are on the mat with no health and the AI can totally hit all their moves, rack up tons of signatures and finishers and deny you the chance to even finish the match, I tried this with the default settings and adjusted settings (I tried to make it easy)and still it is frustrating.I think another thing to make this game better would to allow players to pick and choose which match or era they wanted to instead of being forced to drudge along the entire campaign, come on, this is WWE not a well thought out game like Mass Effect or something.The roster is fine, you will have multiple versions of some superstars (Cena, Triple H, Big Show for a few) but no Trish Stratus, not even as a DLC character, she was the only thing to make this good. So sorry Divas fans, you get another lack luster roster with no Diva legends.Otherwise, this game is okay, if you are patient enough, the Wrestlemania mode brings back a lot of memories, the Undertaker's streak mode is also interesting yet frustrating if you are going for the trophy, all in all, it is a good entry into the WWE series but it has lots of room for improvement.My advice, wait for it to go down in price, that way, you will be able to enjoy the game and once you start getting frustrated, you will not feel so bad like the rest of us who paid the full price.",2,Not quite immortal,1383955200,"11 9, 2013"

I rented the game free due to a major rental chain's promotion, and finished it within that time frame. I really liked it and I went out a bought a copy so I can play it again later. This is a great game, right from the beginning it had me hook with the characters and the story. One major complain about this game from others who(mostly critics) had played those previous entries in the series, was that they are mostly alike in terms of gameplay. But due to the fact that I've never played any other uncharted game before, it was a fresh experience to me, and interesting enough I think it worked out well and is a major factor to how much I enjoyed it.The graphic - is beautiful in this game, I especially like any sequence that shows the Arabic sandy environment and that is including the game menu of course lol, character model and texture are impressive.The Audio - and I want to say particularly the soundtrack gives you a sense of grandeur, at the same time not over the top, and there was no dull moment, all in all the soundtrack makes the whole experience very enjoyable, I had to give it to Naughty Dog, the sound design in this game alone bumps the game production value up several levels, it's like watching a movie, whether that is a good thing or not.The Gameplay - is just about right. Before getting the game I was worrying about there is not much to do in this game gameplay wise, i.e. I was worrying too much QTE, not enough things to do with the character, because all the game press reviews inevitably complain about this one way or the other. but having played it myself, it really wasn't an issue, in fact, the very first time Drake got in the fight I was so pumped up by all the action that was going, just the way ND implemented the whole mechanism was perfect, I was hooked immediately. I don't know if there is a demo for this game on PSN, but I think in order to judge whether the gameplay style is for you, you just need to try it out yourself.The Story - is very good, there are good character personality, development, and surprisingly good acting from the voice actors, witty comments and stuff really made these character come to life. I really like this aspect of the game, a definite highlight.As I stated above, after the free rental, I bought the game lol, and I bought uncharted 2, and finished that as well. I didn't regret for the fact that I didn't finish them in release order, I can definitely say if you played uncharted 2 before, uncharted 3 will play similar, uncharted 3 is just a more refine experience w/ slight changes to gameplay, and I can definitely see where the complains are from, because personally even though I liked uncharted 2, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did for uncharted 3, and maybe I'm in minority here, but I'm so glad I didn't play them in order, because I ruined uncharted 2 experience instead of uncharted 3, I just like the locations that Drake ventured in 3 instead of 2, [spoiler]I just like all the sandy color palette instead of the jungles theme in 2.[/spoiler] and I must say you don't have to play them in order, the story in 3 itself stands alone very well, and all the characters(the major ones) had sufficient introduction on their own, so you don't feel the two previous titles are pre-requisite in any sort of way, ok, maybe I heard you will miss some jokes every now and then, but for me, still great. However the writing in 2 is still worth it to play it at least once.All in all, I highly recommend this game, it is certainly a very well designed game in every aspects, the production value on this game is impressively high. game play itself is pretty linear, it is no Dark Douls, but it is not a title you want to miss and you should experience at least once. a top 3 game for me from 2011, Naughty Dog I salute you.",5,This is a great game,1332115200,"03 19, 2012"

Mind you I'm not that interested in the online multiplayer, I'm talking about the campaign.  I really love the direction that the story has taken, making it more dramatic and just the varied locales really helps to refine the game from the original claustrophic settings to more open and larger with huge battles involving the Locust and all their massive weaponry.  The game will go into this large almost panoramic phase where you'll see a battalion of Locust travelling to some destination and it's up to Marcus Fenix and Don to stop em in their tracks.  Luckily the game gives the player lots of weaponry and turrets that mow down the larger Locust horde.The game takes place in the same place, but the situation is dire, with Jacinto the last human city surviving the onslaught from the Locust.  But this time the Locust attack from underground sinking whole cities and really putting the human race on the ropes.  Sounds like your typical story, but what the game lacks in originality it makes up for it in spades with the presentation, the script and the atmosphere created with the battles and locations.The game mechanics are exactly the same, duck and cover with lots of shooting and grenade tossing, there is no learning curve really, anyone who's got a 360 has tried the original Gears, and if they enjoyed it then the 2nd will not be a far cry from the original.  The one difference really between the original and the sequel is the story, the story is much stronger and rather than having that feeling of just running around shooting and chainsawing away these weird looking monsters, there's a some intrigued tossed in with the origin of the Locust with the warehouse level.Gears 2 does a lot right even if the main character has the personality of lint, and sure the whole story-line is derivative of every story-line that has the whole humanity up against the wall against an unceasing enemy.  However, Gears does it all right, I am a fan now, hopefully the next sequel has more the same with maybe a little more new elements.

His unique people, and how they battle, are a big part of what makes this game so great.  It's just that a casual glance at the box art would make most people write it off as a kid's game, and pass it by.  There are lots of different life forms in Opoona's universe, his just happens to look like Fisher Price people.Opoona is anything but a kid's game.  In fact, if you bought this game for a child, chances are he/she would have been happier with a nice pair of socks.  They'd certainly get more use out of them, anyway.You don't play Opoona, you live out his everyday life, and the lives of his family.  You have to learn how to survive, adjust to new surroundings, and situations, and create strong friendships, in a galaxy where Opoona's people are somewhat unique.  So, there's a little bit of proving yourself along the way, as well.Stepping into Opoona's shoes truly is daunting at first.  As others have mentioned, your first home is vast, and confusing.  You will get the hang of it, if you pay attention to signage, and remember that there is more than just one set of elevators on any given floor.  If you stay on target, you'll be off to the second city in short order.  Again, as has been mentioned, the hardest part is the begining.  The important thing is to stick with it, and this game will reward you as few others in the genre ever did.The story is engaging.  The licensing system is brilliant.  The part time jobs you can take run the full range from humbling, to laugh out loud hilarious.  I liked being able to buy items in the field, watching 'TV' shows, making friends/strengthening friendships, crafting through the use of combining 'secrets' into anything from mundane items, to augmentations for your characters, and even changing the look and functionality of your GUI!There's just one thing that I found bothersome; the fighting fields can sometimes be claustrophobic.  In these areas the view is locked in place as well.  It makes it harder to spot treasure, and easier to stumble into the next battle.  Kind of odd when you see some of the huge expanses in other parts of the game.One handed control is a cool feature, but for the most part, I used the Wii remote for changing camera positions.  I should mention that the classic controller is supported as well.  All modes of control work nicely.Opoona is Phantasy Star Online, Earthbound, The Jetsons, dodge ball, The Sims, and just a tiny pinch of Fisher Price, all mixed up into a tasty power shake of variety, and originality.Opoona is an onion, waiting for you to peal back it's many layers.

To me, it felt like Nordic Games just took a bunch of concepts and gameplay features from decent FPS and threw them together.

Basically you and some branch of the government of USA are searching for the Heart of Atlantis. The heart is scattered in pieces and you have to get them before the Germans do. (Takes place around WW1/WW2)Pros:- The story is somewhat original and a fresh take on an old legend.- The atmosphere and level design is very realistic and well done. (The game uses Unreal Graphics engine)- Enhanced the flashlight part of gameplay from Alan Wake (still feel as though they ripped it off, but it's a little bit better to control)- The actual length of the game is rather the perfect amount, not too short and not neverending.- When you first start out the controls suck, but you then realize that you actually gradually get better based off of treasure you find in the levels. (A more realistic approach to a first-person shooter, as no one is ever good at anything in the beginning)- The collectibles actually pertain to the game (helps you enhance your character)Cons:- While the story is decent, the dialogue is the most cliched dialogue for any adventure story ever.- I feel they ripped off a lot of controls and concepts from more successful games.- For a game that has a puzzle difficulty option, the difficulty doesn't effect the puzzles (which aren't that hard on the hardest difficulty), but rather the clues the game gives you.- For a game the is linear progression there is a lot of empty space.- Things that you can use in the environment aren't obvious.- Not much of a tutorial.- The multiplayer is pretty much Call of Duty: Black Ops, except no one is online either (which like half the achievements revolve around online play). Or it is like Call of Duty Zombies mode.Other:- I got 550G on one playthrough on the hardest difficulty (wasn't hard at all).- Like I said no one is ever playing online so it's sort of pointless.It's up to you to decide whether you want it or not.

I think this is the only one that I have actually enjoyed. The Godfather does a pretty good job of emulating GTA, but has enough different aspects to keep it from being a complete copy-cat. You play as a no-name member of the Corleone family who has to work his way up through the ranks to eventually become the Don of New York. You have to extort businesses for protection money, carry out hit contracts, bribe cops, buy safehouses, rob banks, and take over rackets, warehouses, and other family compounds. In between all this, you get to carry out missions that brilliantly blend into the original Godfather movie. For example, you're assigned the job of beating up the two guys who assaulted the undertaker Bonasera's daughter. You're the guy who plants the gun behind the toilet for Michael Corleone and then drives his getaway car after he kills Solozzo and McCluskey.Driving control is pretty decent. Targeting is much better than the system used in GTA, although it still has a few glitches. The fighting controls were done very well. You can grab your enemy and use various combinations of the analog sticks to punch him, slam him against a wall, throw him across a room, or choke him to death.My biggest complaint about the game is that it is way too repetitive. One thing that was always nice about GTA is that the game world was so diverse. Not so in The Godfather. You never really feel like you know your way around the city because everything looks the same. Interiors are used over and over and over again, and the enemies are almost always in the same place, so it becomes fairly predictable. The five family compounds have the exact same layout. It would have been nice to see them put some more work into creating more original environments.Having said all this, there's about 30-40 hours worth of gameplay here.

My boyfriend has played a few previous Assassin's Creed games before and is a very skilled gamer overall.  This was my first introduction to Assassin's Creed and I'm also newer to the PS3.  I've played several PS3 games before likeFIFA 14 - PS3 [Digital Code],Little Big Planet 2: SE PS3 (98372) -, andPortal 2 - Playstation 3to get my feet wet, but am still getting my bearings when it comes to using the controller (this will come into play later in my review).My boyfriend loves this game.  Compared to the last Assassin's Creed he's played, Assassin's Creed III he felt that the game had been improved in virtually every way.  He thought the graphics were more vivid and realistic than in that version, the game play more varied, and the game play more responsive.  He also thought the storyline was more thought out and less corny.  Even though he felt that a lot of the tasks and missions were similar to previous games he still found the game play fun and exciting.As a newbie, I appreciated that a lot of tips were built into the early missions of the game to help you quickly get on board with what you need to do.  I thought they were comprehensive and easy to follow, but still relatively unobtrusive if you are a more experienced player.  I also wasn't sure how I would feel about the fighting and violence since most of the games I gravitate toward don't seem to have this as a key element.  However, the game play was varied enough that it didn't feel repetitive and was fun.  The only thing worth noting is I think this is a game that is definitely more fun if you are already pretty proficient with the controller.  I certainly am not faulting the game for this as I do think different games are geared toward different skill levels, but I think it is worth noting.  I found even the early challenges pretty difficult to get through because they often require you to be quick with the joystick, especially when you are following people in the game.Overall, I think this is a fun game but probably one that is best suited for someone familiar with the franchise or a more experienced gamer overall.

The result is a staggering arsenal of some 80 different weapons in all.  It's a fun potpourri that includes scythes, scorpion stingers, bows, magical powers, etc...The problem is that many of them are so similar in nature/power that it doesn't feel like there's much uniqueness to them.

This has become an annoying trend in a lot of games recently.  Dante's Inferno offered a huge number of combo attacks but again, Dante's main weapon did the job just fine.This weapon-seize system is horrendously clunky and annoying.  You find yourself constantly swapping out weapons off the menu because they can only be upgraded by performing another steal.  You'll find one use for a weapon and then you're putting it back in inventory and grabbing another weapon as you can only equip four at a time.  Sticking to your sword is your best bet for the most part.The main ""plot"" involves Perseus waging war against his estranged father Zeus and the rest of the Gods and dispatching all manner of mythological beasties along the way.  Perseus' life, weapons, and abilities are powered by gathering the souls of life force of the enemies he kills.  The combat system is as glitchy as the weapon selection...You are constantly surrounded by multiple enemies but switching to a new target is cumbersome and loses your orientation, often making you have to constantly re-target an enemy.Outside of hacking and slashing enemies, Clash of the Titans offers little challenge.  There are a wide variety of side quests but these become monotonous after a while and serve only to add padding to the game.  These involve finding food and items but it's strictly filler material.  Should you put in the MANY hours that it will take to finish the game, you can play co-op with a friend...if you have a friend you particularly dislike and want to torture.  There is a Challenge Mode that allows you to take on individual missions that you already completed during the single-player campaign.The graphics are average at best...while the game moves with a fair amount of fluidity, the visuals are jagged and look dated.  Definitely not up to par with even the average PS3 game.  The voice acting was hollow and stony as one of Medusa's victims.  The one saving grace was a dramatic musical score but that's hardly enough to raise the grade.Bottom line...Clash of the Titans the video game is as ill-conceived as the big screen remake.  While the game COULD have been a decent God of War wannabe, the poor design dooms it from the word go.

And once I learned that I could visit a plastic surgeon at any time and change my gender back and forth, I was even happier.  I also appreciate the fact that Volition supplied six different voice tracks for the protagonist, each with its own personality and nuance, giving the game a distinctly different feel for each playthrough.  For example, the British actor would read one line as ""hey mate"" when it's supposed to be ""hey man.""  Little touches like this give the voice tracks their own personalities.  I was struck at how different a cutscene feels when the hero has a different voice and attitude.Pros:-Be male or female (or a freak; be a man with a high, female voice!)-Great VO work, engaging supporting characters with personality-Variety of missions and activities (especially Septic Avenger; spraying sh** on people is hilarious!)-New features such as human shield, cruise control, fine aiming, dual wielding-More customization options (clothing, tatoos, hairstyles)-Excellent GPS is back, plus now you can place ""bookmarks"" on the map as reminders (i.e. during a mission you find a tag spot, and want to remember its location for later)-Stores are now open 24/7, meaning you no longer have to wait around endlessly to buy that one specific shirt you want-Fresh soundtrack with songs you haven't heard in other games-Instantly warp between a store and your wardrobe, making it easier to mix and match your clothes-Some cool easter eggs to be foundCons:-Bugs/glitches from first game are back (such as cars disappearing, NPCs getting stuck in your vehicle)-Idiot homie A.I.

I have supported NIS since Disgaea 1 for the PS2 and I have played a lot of less than stellar games as a result. I can say without a doubt that this is the worst game that NIS America has ever localized. Hyperdimension Neptunia is developed by Idea Factory and Compile Heart, NISA only handled the localization, good thing because I would have lost all respect for Nippon Ichi Software if this was actually their creation. I adored Trinity Universe (also by Idea Factory), I even put in the time for a platinum trophy. I can't believe how much was recycled from TU for HDN, I really can't. All but a handful of monsters in this game are recycled from TU (I counted 5 new monsters after 40 hours, seriously), some of the dungeons are even the same but with new wallpaper, I know it's a low budget game but it's like they didn't even try this time.HDN is loaded with hilarious dialogue, a very amusing story and likeable characters but it just isn't worth the time. TU at least had some characters from Disgaea and a great battle system, I didn't mind crawling the same dungeons over and over because TU was never advertised as anything but a mindless dungeon crawler. They want you to believe that Hyperdimension Neptunia is a legit RPG with lots of character interaction and towns to explore. It's not, this is another mindless dungeon crawler with a slightly different approach...now you have 4 different backgrounds to do your dungeon crawling in instead of 1 like TU!!! AMAZING BREAKTHROUGH!!!I seriously can't explain how terrible the battles in this game are, I have never been more bored.

On the one hand, it's a great way to have fun as a family and to get some great exercise. But on the other hand, some parents may feel uncomfortable having to explain songs like ""Get Lucky"", ""Blurred Lines"" and ""I Kissed a Girl"" to their very young kids.Ubisoft's answer to these parents is Just Dance Kids 2014. The gameplay is essentially the same as Just Dance 2014, with a few differences that make it more kid friendly. While it's not without its flaws, Ubisoft did a pretty good job of making it a game that the whole family can enjoy.The first difference is that a lot of the extras you see in Just Dance 2014 aren't there. There are no ""Sweat Mode"" and no ""Mojo Points"" to earn. The tracks have one set of dance steps, unlike Just Dance 2014 that has multiple routines per song. And of course, there's no ""JDTV"" nor online play options. You also can't create dancer cards nor track individual dancers' performances (everyone plays as ""Player 1"", ""Player 2"", and so on).The next difference is in the track list. It's not the typical fingerboards-on-the-chalkboard-please-put-me-out-of-my-misery collection of kiddie songs sung by someone who's breathed in too much helium. It actually has a soundtrack which, dare I say, is pretty ""cool"". You have pop songs from stars who got their starts on the Disney Channel like Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato, and Bridget Mendler, as well as popular songs from groups like One Direction and Owl City that tweens in the family will enjoy. You also have oldies like ""Magic Carpet Ride"", ""Footloose"" and ""The Hustle"" that Mom and Dad will appreciate; a few kid-friendly songs from the likes of the cast of Fraggle Rock and The Wiggles; and even ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" and ""Hickory Dickory Dock"" for the toddlers in the family (the former which inexplicably has a difficulty rating of 2/3 stars).Here's a complete track list:789Day ODo You Love MeFirefliesFootlooseFraggle RockThe Freeze Game - Yo Gabba GabbaGet Down On ItGet Ready to Wiggle - The WigglesGive Your Heart a Break - Demi LovatoHickory Dickory DockHit Me With Your Best ShotHit the Lights - Selena Gomez and The SceneThe HustleI Like to Move ItInterstellar SimonMagic Carpet RideMake It Shine - Victoria JusticeMary Had a Little LambOne Thing - One DirectionParty in the KitchenA Pirate You Shall BePower UpsProblem (The Monster Remix) - Becky G feat. will.i.amPut Your Hearts Up - Ariana GrandeReady or Not - Bridget MendlerShoutSkip To My LouThe Tiki Tiki Tiki RoomWalking on SunshineWe Go Well Together - GoldheartEach song is marked with 1-3 stars for difficulty and 1-3 sweat drops for energy level, something which has been in all the versions of Just Dance but which some reason was taken away from Just Dance 2014.The other big difference is in the graphics. Instead of a faceless silhouette as your dance guide, your dance guide is a video image of actual kids dancing to the songs. My guess is that they decided to use real animated figures instead of abstract ones because they're easier for kids to follow--there's even a glowing trail on the dancer's right hand that makes it extremely easy to follow. The animations are also whimsical and again, have a bit more realism and a bit less abstraction than the grown-up game.I'm not sure if I was having a bad night, but motion tracking wasn't working as well for me as it did on Just Dance 2014, which can always be a bit frustrating. Interestingly, Just Dance 2014 for Kids uses the Wii Remote, while the grown-up version uses the Wii Remote Plus, so that might account for some of the difference.There are three dance modes. The first is ""Just Dance"", where just like the grown-up version 1-4 players can dance to the song and are scored on accuracy.The second is ""Freeze and Shake"", which is kind of a cross between ""Red Light, Green Light"" and ""Simon Says"" where in the middle of the song you'll see icons next to your avatar telling you to shake your Wii remote or to freeze, and you'll get points for following the instructions correctly. While I assume this mode was meant to appeal to younger players who are frustrated because they can't do the dance moves, but want to get points for following instructions, this feature kind of fell flat for me. Even as an adult, it was hard for me to focus on the dance moves and constantly be looking in the upper left-hand corner to see whether I should shake the remote or move it.The third mode is ""Team High Score"", where all the players will dance, and while a ""spotlight"" shines on a certain player's avatar, that player will dance while the other players will shake their remotes vigorously to collect the ""stars"" that the player generates. Again, probably a good feature for young players who want to feel like they're earning points just like the older players, but not a very appealing feature for everyone.While I appreciate the addition of these extra modes to try to make it more fun for the family to play together, I'm not sure if these particular modes will be appealing to anyone except for the very young players to ""fit in"". That said, I'd definitely like to see future versions continue to try to come up with ways the whole family can play together.There's a ""Parents"" section of the game that has six options: ""Play Tracker"", where parents can view the gameplay history; ""Progress"" that shows top scores for each of the songs in each of the modes, as well as the number of times each song has been played; ""Medals"", which shows achievements of various kinds; ""Options"", which lets you toggle lyrics, next move icons, progress meter and usage tracking on and off, and also lets you choose your language (English, Spanish, French). There's also a ""Philosophy"" button in this section; when you click it, you read a personal note from the designers, artists, producers and programmers of the game who talk about their approach to making this game.I definitely appreciate this team's philosophy, and they did do a very good job of making a game that's really family-friendly and age-appropraite. But I was a bit disappointed that the new modes weren't as compelling for all ages as they could have been. Also, there are plenty of songs and features on the grown-up version of Just Dance that are perfectly family-friendly, and kids who see their friends with Just Dance 2014 may feel a bit slighted that Just Dance Kids 2014 doesn't have the same level of features or songs.I almost wish that instead of ""penalizing"" parents by making them purchase a new $29.99 game, Ubisoft could just incorporate some of these songs and features into the regular version of Just Dance and provide parental controls for parents who want them.But that said, if you're a parent who has young children, Just Dance Kids 2014 has a great selection of songs and dances for kids aged 6-14, and you can rest assured that you won't be blushing trying to explain the lyrics to the songs.",4,"Good family-friendly alternative to Just Dance 2014, but still in its shadow",1382486400,"10 23, 2013"

I read all of these great reviews and after playing it for about 3 weeks now....I'm thinking....am I missing something??  Really the only positive thing I can say is the running game is fairly well done.  You can actually get yards up the midde which is a new concept for EA sports.  The passing game is pretty weak though, the DBs have a definite advantage, they are quicker to the ball and can do more as far as jumping and putting their hands up.  Your receiver just stands there and waits for the ball to be knocked away, and when the defense blitzes you will be sacked 9 out of 10 times unless you simply throw the ball away.  Your offensive line is a joke.Online play is where this game really goes down the tubes fast.  The load times are insane and the game freezes and slows down constantly during play which gets very annoying when you're trying to pass or kick a field goal.  The big hit stick is useless and was far better in Madden 2005, you don't feel like you're really hitting anybody hard ever in this game.

As your tribe emerges into increasingly hostile landscapes you must use your magic powers to sculpt the natural world in order to protect your people and aid them in their quest for the ""Ancients-"" a past tribe that mastered similar powers. To do this you can move soil and water, pour out lava to make stone, evaporate water with brilliant sunlight, and perform a variety of other miracles which you unlock by helping your villagers settle towns on each map.As a technical demo, From Dust is amazing. Flowing water conforms to rivers you create in the terrain, dirt settles and erodes (and plant growth resists this), lava flows on rock and cools in water, and burns sand into hard stone, and wildfires rip through forests frighteningly. The simulated natural world you interact with feels very real, and everything you feel like you can do totally works- damn a river to make a lake, douse a sandy coast in lava to turn it into a hard stone bank, or blast a trench in a mountainside to divert lava- it all behaves convincingly and organically.As a game From Dust is fun, but has its shortcomings. The challenge is uneven- some later maps are easier than early maps. It is also very short, and astute players may finish in a single setting. Your villagers are also as dumb as bricks and will take the worst routes possible when exploring the map for relics and spells- at one point my shaman ignored a sturdy stone bridge directly from his village to a relic in favor of hiking over an active volcano. And while the game looks fantastic, it also uses the same basic materials in every level, so after a while all the horrible disaster areas you march your peons through start looking samey.For what it's worth I have not experienced the server outages many users have- but I will warn that this game demands both Steam AND Ubisoft's DRM client, which I think is excessive. Since both of these services use different servers depending on your location, I might just have gotten lucky with geography.PROS:-Fantastic graphics and amazing environmental modeling-Innovative gameplay - a puzzle-RTS where nature is your opponent-Nonviolent gameplay makes it suitable for adults and kids with strong problem-solving skillsCONS-Horrible AI-Too much DRM-For such a sophisticated game, surprisingly short",4,A fun tech demo and Populous successor,1344211200,"08 6, 2012"
1848,157045,A2Q2A6JKY95RTP,B003O6E6NE,R. Garrelts,"[1, 2]","Working down my backlog of games I finally had the chance to play and beat Bioshock Infinite. As a big fan of the first two games I wasn't quite sure what to expect with Infinite. While the game was in development I had the chance to read a few articles and see a few early pictures of the development of the game. Having finished the game I can definitively say that Bioshock Infinite is... just okay. In trying to create something different enough to be called new yet similar enough to be called Bioshock, Irrational Games, the development studio behind the series, has created a strange in-between game that comes off as considerably less charming and less engaging that previous Bioshock titles.---------------------STORY:You are Booker Dewitt, a veteran of the US Army and the battle of Wounded Knee, and a former employee of the infamous Pinkerton Detective Agency. Your charge is to infiltrate the sky-city of Columbia and retrieve a girl named Elizabeth. All the information you're given is that you have a debt and by retrieving the girl the debt will be paid. What unfolds after Booker enters Columbia is an interesting story that follows many of the same lines as the original Bioshock title.The leader of Columbia, a man named Comstock is a god-like figure that Columbians' refer to simply as, ""the prophet"". Comstock's persona is represented in almost every aspect of life in Columbia, from larger-than-life statues scattered about to entire floating-islands dedicated to his life. Clearly this is a cult of personality. Comstock is similar to Andrew Ryan in that both reject the meddling of the United States for similar reasons and set about creating their own utopian society that goes horribly wrong.---------------------GRAPHICSThe graphics are again very similar to Bioshock. Character models and the look and feel of everything from buildings to art style are almost identical to that of the original titles. The major change of course is the setting. Columbia floats high above the land and seas below. The graphics are a mixed bag, however. Outside areas (and there are many) in Columbia take on an almost blinding sheen. Everything outside is annoyingly bright and blurred giving the graphics a very soft almost dream-like state. Perhaps that is intentional but I found it extremely annoying. Interior areas are better and feature excellent use of lighting to lend the environments different characteristics. The first area you encounter after you enter Columbia, a temple-like setting where new citizens of Columbia are baptized are excellent examples of the lighting effects as daylight pours through different colored stained glass lending a somber, meditative state to the level.The other obvious complaint with the graphics is that the original Bioshock was released in 2007 and little has changed.---------------------GAMEPLAY:Gameplay in Infinite is, as you'd imagine, very similar to the previous Bioshock titles. This is a first person shooter with the added benefit of magic-like powers. Except know the powers are known as ""vigors"" instead of plasmids. Vigors are pretty much exactly like plasmids with few cursory changes. Instead of injecting vigors you drink them. Vigors use ""salt"" and salt can be replenished by drinking salts scattered around the game, buying them outright from vending machines or acquiring `gear' that imparts salts when certain criteria is met.As Booker you're allocated four-slots to equip `gear' which is a not so clever way of granting passive abilities to the player. For example some gear might impart a bonus for melee attacks that lights enemies on fire or another piece of gear might increase your weapon accuracy while riding sky-lines.The single biggest change is the addition of Elizabeth who after you rescue is a NPC that accompanies you on your journey through Columbia. Really when all of the other tweaks and setting change is boiled away, Infinite is about Elizabeth. Happily she is a contributing member of your part and she is essentially invulnerable. She takes care of herself, hides during battles and even scouts out the surrounding area to provide Booker ammunition, health, and money. Elizabeth plays a central role in the story and has the ability to open tears which are essentially windows into parallel universes. Her power comes especially handy in the heat of battle where Elizabeth can open a tear to provide you with health items or ammo or even a friendly sentry gun.All told your adventure through Bioshock Infinite will probably take around a dozen hours. There are 51 trophies all told and all of them are offline.---------------------THE GOOD:(+) The story is generally good though things can get confusing especially toward the end(+) Graphics are a mixed bag - interior areas retain the same moody atmospherics that were so prevalent in the original Bioshock titles(+) Elizabeth; she is a contributor more than a drain and constant source of frustration (a la Resident Evil 4) more NPCs should be modeled after her---------------------THE BAD:(-) Graphics frequently appear white-washed and blurry particularly in outdoor areas(-) Same basic graphics as the 2007-released Bioshock, in other words the engine is dated(-) Very little has changed besides the setting; other changes (e.g. vigors) are simply renamed properties from previous Bioshock games(-) The story has plenty of plot holes and contradictions---------------------CONCLUSION:Bioshock Infinite is a good enough game that I recommend purchasing it especially at the reduced price it's selling for currently. However, that doesn't diminish the fact that this is essentially the same game that was released 6 years ago with a different setting. Hopefully the inevitable sequel in the Bioshock franchise on next-gen systems is a bit more thought out and developed.",3,Bioshock Infinitely Overrated,1384300800,"11 13, 2013"

When I first heard the announcement of a new game (since Moonwalker on the genesis) at E3 in June, I was very excited. When screenshots and videos came out for the Wii version I was very concerned. Ubisoft has created an ugly looking Just Dance clone lacking any distinguishable traits or visual charm. The main character didnt even look like Michael and following along while waving a remote in the air seems silly to me, I think casual gamers might like it though.In the weeks leading up to the release of both the DS and PSP versions I was surprised to find little to no information about them. It wasn't until a few days after their releases that any videos were up about them. I saw the PSP version only used 2 buttons and looked way too easy, and that the DS version was like the rhythm game Elite Beat Agents. Being a fan of the Elite Beat Agents series I decided to get the DS version which was only 5$ after buying Batman Brave and The Bold for DS as part of a special sale.The game features a cartoony Michael (in vain of the Beatles Rockband) who dances around performing various moves. During each song you tap, slide, and spin circles in the order they are numbered and while it may sound simple, like Elite Beat Agents it is very fun. There have been many Elite Beat Agents clones over the years but this is easily the best. The game is just as responsive and the notes are laid out just as good as EBA. There are Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty. Being a bit rusty on my EBA skills I was having trouble doing well on Medium difficulty from the getgo. Some may find this good, others bad, but unlike Elite Beat Agents you wont fail for missing just a few notes, although you definitely can fail a song. The true fun in this game comes from trying to get all the golden coins (which are like the star system in guitar hero). This involves building up a great combo and knowing when to use your built up star power(Again an idea taken from guitar hero), which is gained by hitting glowing notes at the right timing in succession. Another great addition that adds replayability is the ability to ""Crown"" a song, which involves getting a ridiculously high score knowing exactly when to use your star power and being able to spin Michael really fast.Trying to achieve 5 coins on medium difficulty is hard enough, but hard mode will keep players trying for more. Which is great because the games tracklist is lacking. Getting more coins and crowns allows you to unlock new songs on the tracklist, collectible Memorabilla, and Jukebox mode. The memorabilla is digital recreations of props from his short films and dance routines like the Billie Jean socks, or the Scream spaceship. Although they are pointless to view it adds more replayability to the game as getting the more difficult ones involve crowning songs on hard mode. The worst part about this game is the tracklist, they are all great MJ songs but the problem is with a few of the choices and the small amount of songs:Another Part of MeBadBeat ItBillie JeanBlack or WhiteDont Stop Till You Get EnoughHeal the WorldLeave Me AloneSmooth CriminalStreetwalkerThe Way You Make Me FeelWanna Be Startin' SomethinMost of these songs are great choices but the slow tempo Heal the World is not to fun to play. I personally love Streetwalker (which was an unreleased song included on the Bad 2001 rerelease) but it is too obscure for a mainstream audience. Disappointingly there are no songs from HIStory, Blood on the Dancefloor, or Invincible. Some of the songs feature him dancing on a stage in various customes, and others are recreations of the music videos they correspond with. The biggest surprise is that there is no Thriller, which is his biggest hit to casual fans.  It is great to have a nice, well made rhythm game on the go and I'd much rather have a well made game with a short tracklist than a game that has a long tracklist but unpolished gameplay (PSP and Wii Versions). So look at the tracklist, if you like the songs, Elite Beat Agents, Michael Jackson, and can find this for cheap than pick it up.",4,Great Fun for Any MJ Fan,1292198400,"12 13, 2010"

I enjoy third person shooters and stealth games alike, so I picked it up for its affordable price.Absolution stars Agent 47; a legendary hitman who feels betrayed by the government group he works for known as &#34;The Agency&#34;. After assassinating a former member of The Agency, 47 feels guilt for the first time and vows to protect Victoria, whose importance is unknown to 47 at the time. What follows is a dark, mature story told through beautifully done cinematics in between the sneaking and murdering of the bad guys in your way. It is gripping, and while the antagonists are cardboard and not memorable, 47 and his interactions with Victoria are heartfelt and engaging. The story is the star of the package here.Gameplay boils down to either sneaking around and disposing of enemies, shooting everything in sight, or slipping through the shadows in an attempt to find the primary target of the level. Stages in Absolution are linear, but open for you to explore and to find the most creative way to dispose of your targets (the signature kills of this game are brutal and are totally worth the extra work). Players that need it can take advantage of the &#34;instinct mode&#34;, which allows 47 to do things such as easily slip past guards or dispose of everything in the room with the blink of an eye, but true Hitman veterans don't need to use this at all. I found myself using the system in only the most dire of situations, and resorting to stealth and carefully picking off targets instead. There are plenty of disguises scattered throughout the world (not to mention being able to steal the clothes off your fallen victims), though these are almost useless since people of the same disguise will instantly know you're an imposter. A huge complaint I have with the gameplay is that restarting at checkpoints causes all of the guards you have killed (including bodies you properly dispose of) to respawn, meaning all of your hard work went to waste.Also included on top of the main story is a player made mission system known as Contracts, which allows you to compete with friends and the world alike for the fastest time and the cleanest kills. This is a fun bonus on top of the lengthy single player campaign.Hitman Absolution is a great game with a few forgivable hiccups.

It's also handy for arcade-y titles and MacMAME, the emulator of  classic arcade video games.The one place Gravis makes a change is very  much for the worse -- the four separate directional buttons are replaced by  a single pivoting directional-pad.  As too often happens with designs like  this, the D-pad pushes two switches at once, and ALWAYS comes through as a  diagonal (eg, right + up, when you thought you were just pushing right).  The frequent inability to enter a true right, left, up, or down is annoying  in some games, particularly in navigating the menus of an RPG, and deadly  in others (PSX &quot;Asteroids&quot; is unplayable when rotating your ship  sometimes inadvertantly puts you into hyperspace, since that's what  &quot;up&quot; does).Also of note is the fact that this controller works  only with games written to use Apple's &quot;InputSprockets&quot;.  That's  true of most late 90's / early 2000's games, but not of some earlier titles  (&quot;Descent&quot;, which used to be bundled with Mac Performas, comes to  mind), and it's not clear if Sprockets will be supported in the upcoming  Mac OS X.That said, driver installation is easy and has been hassle-free  on my two iMacs and my iBook.  USB plug-and-play almost always works  without a snap, though I've found it's better to plug it in once the Finder  is up instead of during the boot cycle.If you play lots of Mac games  (and by the way... HOW?!), this is better than relying on mouse/keyboard  alone, but the D-pad problems are a major aggrivation.",2,"Tolerable, unspectacular PlayStation work-alike",966729600,"08 20, 2000"

1059,50568,A21P8800ZGRGIP,B0002RQ3KC,Miketheratguy,"[0, 0]","I've been a fan of wrestling for twenty years. Well, I ducked out during the stagnant WWF period of the mid 90s and stayed away for Stone Cold's push to the moon. Then I was with it again, until things became stagnant again with Triple H's invincibility and the lack of any real WWE competition. God bless you Chris Benoit and Rey Mysterio, you keep wrestling from being all boredom.Similarly, the games have been hit and miss. Once WWF Warzone hit in '98, wrestling games skyrocketed. Create modes made things immersive as possible, and almost every entry made things even better. Unfortunately, though this game is getting inexplicably high reviews, it's a genuine step backwards the likes of which were last seen in the first PS2 Smackdown, ""Just Bring It"".Here's the reason: Smackdown: Shut Your Mouth was incredible. A huge, long story mode with choices that went on forever as well as the most robust roster of superstars. Here Comes the Pain took a slight step back by trimming the roster and completely cutting the story mode in half, giving you about three plays through to see everything. It added some cool stuff like complete wrestler stats and records, as well as grapplers like Goldberg and Mysterio.This time, the wrestling game is as basic as it's been in years. Don't get it if you want a long, interesting storyline. There are about 4 or 5 different outcomes, and they all begin the same way. You'll start by trying to steal a foreign wrestler's diva or some other boring storyline. As others pointed out, you literally have to play through the story mode once, twice at most, to see all the different things.The new create a belt and pay per view modes are a wash, too. In an overcomplicated mess, you need to have two memory cards to create a belt and compete for it against a friend, since you can't fight the computer for it or some other insane obstacle. There goes half of what I bought the game for, which was the ability to defend my titles anytime in any match type (which you can't). In wanting the best wrestling simulation, I adored the ability to sort of engineer my own seasons and belt rivalries. Smackdown 2 for the PS1 let me do all of that, and never tried again since. This time, I thought create-a-belt would give me that chance, but it really doesn't. Even if you do make a belt, have fun playing a basic singles match against your friend because that's about as far as it'll go.The roster isn't very impressive either, but that's because, in my opinion, the WWE's current roster is missing a lot of former greats nowadays. It missed out on faces such as Eugene as well, who was around before the game was. It's not all bad, just another thing that sets it back. The addition of some truly fantastic wrestlers in the Legends roster is great, though. Can't go wrong with Bret Hart and Roddy Piper. Oddly however, some of these guys don't have their original entrance music while others do. Not huge, but noticable.The game itself is ok. It takes an evening or two to get through the storylines, and along the way you'll constantly be judging the new wrestler voice-overs rather than just accepting them. Vince Mcmahon is dialed way up and Eric Bischoff is half asleep, but some guys like 'Taker and triple H can at least work the microphone. You won't notice much anyway, since I played the story mode four times and literally fought the same group of 5 or 6 people each time.Don't be fooled by the new match types either. Some stuff is fun, like the strength-related ability to stay in the Royal Rumble when thrown over the ropes (though this takes all spontaneity away from it, since wrestlers DO sometimes go out right away in real life). But then they did away with pretty much any backstage areas whatsoever to instead give us two that revolve around gimmicks. Fight in a one-room car park where each of the 5 or 6 cars does something different (like flashing lights) when you wrestle on it. The other area is a backstage hallway where you can throw the wrestler into food or fences. Believe me, it's not as fun as it sounds and gets old after about two times. There's no way here whatsoever to recreate some of the wild backstage stuff like the Kane/Raven/Big Show WM17 match. Like everything in this game, it's as basic as it can be.The gameplay itself is okay. There are new pre-match button tricks that you can compete in, but won't since they're a chore more than anything. And online mode, though I didn't try, is supposed to be decent but nothing special as well. The matches that are there, and the game mechanics that have been ported from previous installments in the series, are as good as they ever were but unfortunately surrounded by a shell of letdowns. Unlockables are even a joke. Want new clothes, lots of new arenas, and stuff like that? NO? Good, because aside from a couple basic arenas and a John Cena outfit, pretty much all we have is a big handful of loading screen photos.Bottom line? If you want an engrossing, lengthy story mode that gives you all kinds of crazy options and rivalries and contests, just drop five bucks on ""Shut Your Mouth"". If you want a more up to date roster, go with last year's ""Here Comes the Pain"" which is a more basic story mode but right on par with this one (and without the dumb voices). However, if you crave an online experience, or the most up-to-date roster, or a game with a pretty linear story structure and 70% poor voice acting, then this is the one for you. It's not a terrible game, but nowhere near as good as these ratings tell you. At least rent it first, because surely one of you will be as disappointed as I was.EDIT: The sequel, Smackdown V Raw 2006 came out and made this game completely disposeable. It has a vastly improved season mode, new match tricks, and entirely new gameplay modes. There's no reason to play this game if you can get SDVR2K6.",3,"The 2nd worst in the series.

6078,72050,AXKJI57FKQ6YN,B000G7PMX2,"Austin Shau ""MrCHUPON""","[0, 0]","Red Steel packs in a lot of interesting ideas and quirks that ultimately just don't come together. Whether it was due to unfamiliarity with the Wii technology, the rush to meet a console launch deadline, or both, Red Steel is filled with myriad glitches and annoyances for every innovation made.Sword fighting is a nifty idea that ultimately devolves into oversimplified slashing as opposed to something more graceful. Of course, part of this can be blamed on the limitations of the Wii remote, but it doesn't change the end result -- a timing-based mode that resembles a poor man's Punch-Out!! and whose ""special moves"" are incredibly difficult to pull off thanks to some unresponsive motion controls.Targeting is great -- using the Wii remote's pointing capabilities for shooting is always a treat -- but changing your viewing angle is awful, since it's contingent on you jamming your targeting reticle at the edges of the screen. In a slower-paced game like Zelda, this was acceptable. In a first-person shooter, this is as limited as (if not moreso) using an analog stick instead of mouse-look, and -- as a result -- just does not cut it. The ""bullet-time"" gimmick is brought back here, and it at least adds a bit of variety to how you plan out your gun battles, but the ""zoom-in"" motion needed to effectively use it is awkward.Then there's the host of clipping bugs, ""inactive"" enemy character models, and enemies who freeze in place. Add these issues on top of the aforementioned rough motion controls and lazy viewing angle mechanics, and the game ends up feeling like a mess. Undoubtedly these were due to the rush to meet launch, and while we can sympathize with developers who face this pressure, the sad truth is that -- again -- the end result is what it is: a half-broken game.Red Steel really could have been something, and though this game miserably fails to be a compelling experience, there's enough of a foundation of ideas here that I have faith in a sequel as long as the development team does its due diligence. With Wii Motion Plus on the way and the lack of unwanted console launch pressure, Red Steel's successor could be everything that this game wants to be.

4106,86650,ADKA2MJQQCMTO,B000R0URCE,Ron Sullivan,"[5, 6]","I was first made aware of 'Force Unleashed' about two years ago at a trade show. Lucas Arts had sponsored a presentation where they chose to show off the Pixelux created ""Digital Molecular Matter (DMM)"" and naturalmotion's ""Euphoria"" engines that were under development. DMM meant that, in the game environment, wood would break like wood, glass would shatter, and metal would bend, and so on. The euphoria engine meant that, to a degree, enemy AI would all act independently. Trying to throw a storm trooper over a railing? He's going to try to grab anything in reach to prevent him from being thrown. It was all wildly impressive stuff, and when applied to a theme of ""unleashing the force"" everyone thought this was a game that had the potential to be a real mold-breaker.So did Lucas Arts come through in reinventing the wheel? Well ... yes and no. Both the DMM and EE are every bit as impressive as we were lead to believe they would be. In the demo alone, I had a blast just running around breaking stuff. I can't even describe how giddy I was watching a storm trooper flail around wildly as i either flung him into another group of enemies or off of a bridge. Using force-blast to plow my way across a bridge or cat-walk will just give you a tremendous sense of satisfaction. 'Force Unleashed' is a terrific effort and there's certainly enough working here to absolutely make this worth checking out.I don't want to do anything to spoil the story-line, but I thought it did a great job of bridging the gap between the prequel trilogy and the original films (episode III-IV). I'd have no hesitation saying that I'd take the story in 'Force Unleashed' over the animated theatrical 'Clone Wars' abomination that we were subjected to. Although I felt the in-game romance for the Apprentice is a bit shoe-horned, in my opinion, the plot is one of the game's highlights.The look of the game is impressive. Levels are beautifully rendered, all the character's movements are all fluid, and the sound is vintage Star Wars. All of it looks and sounds like it belongs without a hair out of place.I liked the way you could use the in-game point's system for 'Force Unleashed' to customize how you use the force. Do you want to max-out your health or lower the time it takes for your force power to recharge? Decisions like this will effect how you attack your foes and provide you with a more unique gaming experience.As much as I wanted this to be a mold-breaking masterpiece however, it just isn't. 'Unleashed' made a few missteps that really cripple the game. Although your newfound force powers are immensely fun to control, the targeting system is terribly frustrating. The fact that the environment is so destructible and interactive is almost a blessing and a curse. While it's wildly fun to go into a room or a space and tear it apart, there'll be so much debris lying around it becomes difficult to target the right piece to force grip or the correct enemy to attack. The game will try and target the closest thing the CHARACTER is looking at instead of what the PLAYER is using the camera to look at. In my opinion, I felt this led me to having to adjust the camera way more then I felt I should have. In the middle of a battle, this is something that can become irritating rather quickly.Although I thought that level design LOOKED beautiful, they travel awfully linear. Every level is strictly a journey from point A to point B. You're never really given the chance to find your own way around. I go back to just how awesome it would be to travel an open-world environment similar to Grand Theft Auto. This is a common gripe of mine, but I also hate back-tracking through an already explored world. I'd say about forty percent of the back-half of 'Force Unleashed' is going to be spent in places you already feel like you've been.As cool as using the force is, the longer you play the game the more of a slashing light-saber game this turns into. It's as if Lucas Arts was never able to correctly figure out how to give you all these awesome powers to control without making the game too easy. In the final third of the game, I felt like you were running into too many enemies that were able to block all of my force powers. There's also a disproportion in the strength of the enemies you'll run into. The worst example is that I can take on waves of Tie-Fighters and rip a Star Destroyer out of orbit, and yet I'm running for my life from a few Dark Troopers? It just doesn't make a tremendous amount of sense. There should have been a much better balance here then there is.Some of the boss fights can be extremely tedious, especially if you're playing on higher difficulties. One of the things that drove me the craziest is the amount of ""cheap-shots"" that are allowed to be taken at your expense. Whether it's allowing a boss to hit you while you're laying on the ground, defenseless; or the way you'll be fighting one-on-one with a rancor, only to be randomly blind-sided.  There are a few moments that'll have you ready to throw your controller against a wall.I know these issues I have sound like a lot and I really don't mean it to. 'Force Unleashed' is no worse then one of the top three Star Wars games available on a next-gen console. In my opinion, I have no regrets about having paid sixty-bucks for it. If the price goes down, it's absolutely worth a purchase. It's just a shame that the game's reach didn't seem to match the ambitions it appeared Lucas Arts had for it. As it stands now, the original 'Knights of the Old Republic' is still king of the hill.",3,"""Terrific"" Effort  ... ""Pretty Good"" Result",1228780800,"12 9, 2008"

An interactive puzzle experience.  The game was followed up later with Big Brain Academy and that was also pretty good.  Now we've got Brain Age 2 which is more or less an expansion to the first one.The mini-games here are fun and addictive much like the first one.  A lot of it actually comes from the first game but now they've added more twists to the games or updated some of them.  Not every mini-game is a winner, but if you liked the first Brain Age game, then this one should satisfy.  These mini-games are quite a challenge too.  Especially because some of the ""twists"" they threw into these games really actually makes you start thinking, or better yet, memorizing things.Nintendo also threw in some multi-player this time.  You and your friends can compete and it only takes one card to do so.  The rest of your friends just have to bring their DS along.The two biggest problems of the first Brain Age still exists here however.  Games that require you to speak or games that require you to write don't always work in your favor.  You could say the correct answer but for some reason the game won't ""hear"" you correctly and you'll get it wrong and get penalized.  Just the same when it comes to handwriting simulation games it might not be able to ""read"" your handwriting.  It's actually pretty annoying and you're unfairly penalized for it.Despite that, however, Brain Age 2 is still a fun game and a great follow up to the first game.

Warning, this review is opinionated.I AM a Battlefield veteran and have been playing the Battlefield series ever since the demo of BF1942 came out. My roots with this franchise go way back and I have seen all of the progress and design choices being made from start to finish. While my PC gaming days have somewhat come to an end, I have this game on the Xbox 360.Let's start off on the Beta for the 360. Yikes. I think all of you who played the beta were sweating a little bit before the game came out, with good reason. It was a mess. RIDDLED with glitches, poor hit detection and connective issues that prevented you from getting/staying in a game. Well let's all take a deep sigh of relief because all of this was glossed over.... For the most part.At first when I sat down with BF3, I immediately went to the singleplayer. The singleplayer caught a lot of flak from reviewers for why, I am not sure. It was actually quite surprising and immersive compared to other Battlefield campaigns. Hell, BF1942's singleplayer was nothing more than a bot match on the Multiplayer maps. Am I saying it's covered with gold? No, it has it's linear issues and occasional hiccups, but for the most part, it's right on track with awesome sauce as the Bad Company games were.Not long after I had a good go with single, did I go to multiplayer. Ah yes, the multiplayer. What the Battlefield series has ALWAYS and FOREVER will be known for. It comes to a very large surprise that it simply does not hold up to it's predecessor. Bad Company 2 multiplayer was tasty, I mean it was very very good. This game is still plagued with glitches that were present in the Beta. Did a lot of it get fixed from the Beta? Sure.... But they're still there. I still notice them. So a patch that may or may never come to fix them will not earn any of these points back. Glitches I am talking about aside from lag: Vaulting over objects only the instantly appear back in front of them, going prone then instantly popping back up or into crouch, going prone and then clicking the sprint button whilst running from fire, only the instantly go BACK prone and receive many shots to the @@@.Am I bashing the game just in the presence of glitches? No. We must also take in to account that the graphics are just simply disappointing.... Even with the ""HD graphics"" installed, they are NOT good!!!! Bad Company 2 graphics were finger-lickin... You could see the individual threads of enemy fatigues, you could see the dirt smudged on your teammates faces... You could interact with the map and feel as if you were truly there... Do you remember those epic tank battles across the mountain sides of Heavy Metal? The shells that impacted the ground would actually indent the ground creating craters that affect those who walk/drive through them. None of that exists in Battlefield 3. It just doesn't.The ""My Soldier"" customization... A distater area. I mean, who okayed, morever CREATED, the layout that they put on the progression/stats/customization screen? It's God awful. The only way to see what guns you have unlocked or are you are about to unlock is the keep flipping to the right and left and seeing if it has a tiny little ""lock"" icon on it. Where the hell is the big gun graph that Bad Company 2 had? I'm not saying that that was the most perfect and elegant thing ever, but it sure as hell blows this out of the water. Why can't I check the progress I made with a particular gun? I can't check how many kills I've made with a specific gun? The only way I see any type of progress with a gun is to see how many attachable's I have available for it. Cool.Frostbite 2.0? More like Frostbite 1.1; better yet: Frostbite .05. Where is the destruction for crying out loud? 9/10 rockets I shoot at walls do ""NoThInG"". Has anyone played Red Faction: Guerilla? THAT was destruction... THAT was a league above all else... This is a step backwards. It's almost embarrassing. Remember in Bad Company 2 when if you shot enough walls out of a building, it would collapse? Sigh, I miss those days.Battlefield 3 is a mess. Singleplayer is fine, but it really lacks it's heart. The claims DICE and EA has made about Frostbite 2.0 were nothing more than a scam. The graphics are not what they were from Bad Company 2. The playability is a step down. The whole game is a step down. It really hurts me.Have fun PC users, because the Xbox360 version of this is a damn shame.Bring on November 8th please.",2,Disappointing.,1319760000,"10 28, 2011"

The story and voice acting are good, and actually flow fairly well. There is even some good character development, not a lot for the NPCs, but still some. There are also a good amount of interesting missions. But after not too long it starts to get very repetitive. Some missions are frustratingly difficult as is the standard, but must be beat in order to advance. As usually you are initially locked into one area when you start the game and unlock other areas through mission completion. Which is well and good but that prevents this from being a true 'open world' experience. I have never been thrilled with the GTA control scheme and this is no different. The controls are not as responsive as I like, and buttons are assigned to many actions. So you will find your character doing something other than you want him too fairly often. The shooting and targeting system is much improved, but the lock on system is poor. Personally I hate GTA4, I find it repetitive and annoying with a good amount of mission success resulting from just dumb luck. There are far too many chase missions, some you have no trouble with and some you will be constantly foiled by NPC drivers. If you are already a GTA fan this is more of the same, but slightly better and you will love it. If you are on the fence I would recommend a rental. And if you are luke warm to the series this iteration isn't going to convert you. Good gaming.",2,"More of the same, but a bit better",1223942400,"10 14, 2008"

Sometimes you'll find yourself rebooting your Xbox over and over again due to this weird black screen bug that makes the screen black and mutes the volume and freezes the game here and there with remarkable consistency. Occasionally some quests won't let you complete them (although Microsoft has already issued one patch for this).But far and away the worst thing abut this game is it's lack of direction. It's like there were multiple people calling the shots on this game, one was a really lame old guy who wanted more fart jokes and less violence, one of them was a talented video game designer (who didn't get much say), and the rest were a team of elementary school students.

It is probably my fav game of all time and I have spent much time mastering it. With that said: on to VF4. Everything about this game is is pretty good. The graphics are good (although I think they could be a little better) and the sound is good as well. The real winner here is the many technical moves and combos you can pull off with the characters. The shaolin monk and the drunk are the coolest characters to ever enter the fighting genre (with the exception of Lei from Tekken) The main problem I had with the game and the reason I only gave it 3 stars. (actually more like 3 1/2) is the button config./combo system. This is a real pain in... The fact that you have to hit an actual button to guard (instead of just holding back) is more of a pain than you can possibly imagine. And the combo system is very very very complicated and annoying.So, if you can get past the annoying and complicated button config. then you got a fun game to play.

I had played Far Cry and I had heard the open gameplay compared to Crysis. So I was excited to see that Crysis 2 was going to be released on consoles and I'd get a chance to play it. When I finally did I can't say I was thrilled. The game is a very solid FPS and the graphics are fantastic. The level design is also good and the weapon selection is great. They managed to give all the weapons a distinct feel. But all of that just makes a good solid shooter, not a fantastic one.Crysis 2 feels to me as a mash between Modern Warfare and Halo. It has the large set piece moments and very linear path to follow like Modern Warfare. And you spend time as a super soldier killing aliens like Halo. What is lacks is the good story elements of either of those games. Since this was the first Crysis released on consoles they should have expected plenty of first time players. The game assumes the player must have played the first game because the story starts in the middle and makes no sense. I spent the game shooting bad guys and had no idea what was going on. Nor did I even care. The time when a shooter could just be about shooting has passed. In this day of blockbuster video games with massive budgets story, plot and game flow can't be neglected anymore. No matter how solid the game play or how beautiful the graphics the game is no fun if you have no connection with the story or character. The whole game left me bored and I had no interest in playing through it again, nor really finishing it the first time.If you do want to play through it, and again it is a solid shooter, I recommend you spend some time on Wikipedia catching up on the story at least.

However, after I played through the additional down-loadable content it improved it's status markedly.

However, the first few bosses are merely cliched munition fodder.Combat sequences are well paced and unfold in an intuitive manner.Vehicle (hovercraft specifically) combat and parachuting sequences have a good feel to them and excellent physics but they are so easy they become quickly forgotten.One other thing of note is that this game does a good job of creating an immersive atmosphere for the Blackwater-esque corporate mercenary that is lacking in other titles of this genre.While it's no COD4 or Gears of War it is definitely exceeds the benchmarks of the average FPS titles that feature tacked-on co-op.

I almost never buy DS games new because I hate to pay $30+.....but this game sounded like so much fun and had such high reviews....that I gave in and bought it.  Soooooooo glad I did!!!!  This is my new favorite game.  You start off creating your character (name, look, outfit) and then you start working at a local boutique.  You assist incoming customers with their search for the perfect shirt, skirt, pants, accessories, shoes, dress.....whatever they want.  They tell you what they are looking for, and then you look through the store inventory to see if you can find the item.  The customer never tells you what color or design they are looking for......it's up to you to look at the way the customer is dressed and then pick out a style YOU think they would like.  When looking at the clothes they are wearing,  it helps to note their color choices, pattern (plaid maybe?),  short vs. long skirts.....that sort of thing.  If you THINK you have an item they would like,  you can choose to have them LOOK at the item BEFORE trying it on.  If they don't like your item.....you have 2 more chances to find them something they'd like before they tell you to just bring something to the dressing room.  OR if you think you have THE PERFECT item that they'll want......send them straight to the dressing room to try it on.  If they love it....they will almost always buy more stuff.  If they DON'T love it....then you have just lost that sale and the customer leaves.After a while,  you are given the opportunity to manage your own boutique (choosing the store design, name, music ). At that point,  you are no longer just a sales person,  you are also a buyer.  You'll need to periodically go to the buyer's warehouse to order clothes from various clothing vendors.  One vendor specializes in sport clothing, another has goth gear, another has more earthy clothing, etc.  I think there are 12+ vendors and MANY MANY clothes and accessories to choose from.....all vary in color and price or style.  You can only have a certain # of styles in your store inventory (you can increase the # during the course of the game) so you will have to make choices and spend your $ wisely....as you will not be able to buy EVERY item you want.  You also are responsible for promotion at your store.....which means designing ""looks"" for the window displays and creating flyers and advertisements for mailing.  You can also choose to have store wide sales to draw in more customers.  If (for example) you choose to advertise a certain pair of jeans in your flyer.....you need to make sure you have enough on hand if a few people show up looking for them. Hopefully the public will LIKE what you put in the flyer....or you could get stuck with a lot of unwanted jeans in your inventory.While working,  you will meet a hair-stylist and a cosmetician who have opened their shops near your store.  If you want to take a break from the customers at your store....you can go get your hair done or you can go to the make-up store and buy some stuff for yourself.  Anything you buy will show up in your make-up case at your apartment. Fun fun fun!!!And then there are the fashion shows.....you compete against other shop owners for prizes and recognition.This game is a business sims type of game.....very in-depth....and lots of fun.

While I've heard the controls described as unresponsive and clumsy, I've actually found them to be quite good!  It's a totally different experience to control yourself by tilting the controller.  However, your dragon is fairly incapable of doing quick, sharp turns...and this makes some missions more difficult than necessary.  The missions are intense, but sometimes it is difficult to tell who are the Asylians and who are the Mokai.  If you don't have a high-definition TV, good luck with that one, since the details will be lost.One more nagging annoyance I have is how the wonderful music will play through a scene, then abruptly cut off as it starts a new one.  I think they should've made the transitions more seamless.  However, this is a minor cosmetic issue and has no bearing on the gameplay.So is this a classic, timeless game?  Not by a long shot.  But it is a worthy PlayStation 3 title that'll keep you occupied for a while.",3,A worthy way to show off your PS3!,1189123200,"09 7, 2007"
6573,10807,A36UKFV79879MD,B00004SVXG,BX Lounger,"[1, 2]","When you talk about Capcom, the developer and publisher has a long and celebrated history. They got their start during the 1980's making video games for the NES. In 1987, they released several of them in hopes of showing that their games were fun to play. Little did they knew that a major franchise was born to humble beginnings; Mega Man almost didn't see the light of day outside of Japan. Capcom decided at the last minute to release it in the U.S. and it led to one of the worst box art designs in the history of video games. It didn't matter because the few players who got their hands on this game realized that there was something cool about it. Word of mouth quickly spread out through the gaming community and Mega Man had gathered a cult following. Oh yes....the Blue Bomber's first adventure left quite an impression on gamers everywhere.In Mega Man, you control Mega Man (AKA Rockman in Japan), a human-like robot created by Dr. Wright (later on, Capcom changed his name to Dr. Light.) He sought out the game's main villain, Dr. Wily, who re-programmed Dr. Wright's robots to work for him and wreck havoc in the city of Monsteropolis. As Mega Man, you chose from six stages filled with enemies, traps, pits and a Robot Master. Beat the Robot Master of each stage to acquire his special power. After you clear all six stages, you ran through four more stages filled with more boss characters, the chance to fight all six Robot Masters again and finally, you fought against Dr. Wily. You did not have access to passwords or battery backed saves but you were able to pick up extra lives and had unlimited continues.The PROS: Out of all the games Capcom released, this one stuck out. It was a one of a kind game involving robots, a futuristic setting, the ability to gain enemy robots' powers and interesting stage layouts that put your shooting, jumping and memorization skills to the test. For its time, the graphics were pretty sharp and bright. The sound effects and controls were spot on and easy to appreciate. The music was excellent since each Robot Master's stage got its own theme so it fit the mood perfectly. There was a lot of variety when it came to enemy robots and some were exclusive to certain stages. Mega Man quickly became known as a hard as nails game to play through so if you beat it, you were among an elite group of gamers that managed to pull it off.The CONS: Since it was really hard to beat back then, it also proved to be its biggest fault. At the time, most games were pretty easy to clear compared to Mega Man. The game had been too much for some players which led to most people who attempted to beat it to give up completely. It was a bit demanding to beat the game in one setting even though you had unlimited continues and enemies would randomly drop extra lives though not as often. It was also one of the few games where you didn't earn extra lives through points so it didn't help at all.Despite the steep learning curve and the fact that it demanded high gaming skills, Mega Man earned its place in video game history and gave birth to one of Capcom's most recognized video game characters. They would go on to release five more sequels on the NES, a new spin off series for the SNES and PS1 and multiple portable iterations. If you missed your chance to play this diamond in the rough title, you can search for a used copy or pick up the Mega Man Anniversary Collection for the PS2 or Gamecube consoles. Also, if you own a Wii, you can download this game from their Virtual Console Service for US $5.00 (500 points.)",4,The Blue Bomber's first adventure,1318809600,"10 17, 2011"

The only problems I found annoying about the gameplay was the fact that EVERY level forces you to use your navy.  I never really liked using the navy and being forced to use them every time was frustrating.  The second problem is that you do not have any good base defenses, unless you build up a lot of units/vehicles around your base, then your base will be destroyed every few minutes. Besides that, the game would be a fine addition to any RED ALERT fan except for RA's biggest problem that is EA related.Now, here comes my biggest gripe, EA's idiotic DRM policy.  This is the reason I am giving the game one star instead of four.  The game REQUIRES online activation(there is an option to call), if you are not online for occasional DRM checks then you cannot run the game you just bought.  Secondly, this makes the game you PAID for a leased game and not a game you actually OWN.  If the DRM servers EVER go down, you will not be able to play this game in the future.

Ever since GTA III, the sandbox nature of the game, the infinite urban sprawl and the rural backwoods have all been fun to explore, and the game has only gotten better over time. Well, almost.GTA IV, on its own, is a fun game, but lacks the depth and vastness of San Andreas, its predecessor. It improves graphically, but I feel certain elements were sacrificed in the process. Otherwise, great story, great gameplay, and excellent attention to detail.And if I were reviewing the PS3 version, it would have 5-stars. So, why only one star overall? Well, the first sign of problems came from SecuROM. Now, I hate game pirating as much as anyone, and I think there should be measures in place to prvent it. Invasive, questionably malicious software is not the answer. Second issue comes in the ""Social"" prompt, which plagues the game every time I want to start it up. That is a minor annoyance, but a detraction nonetheless. NOW, let's talk about the BIGGEST annoyance. If you want to autosave, you had better be willing to sign up to Windows Live. That's right, you are basically forced to bump Microsoft's Windows Live numbers if you want to use autosave. That would be like having to sign up for PSN if you wanted to save on that version, or signing up to the Nintendo Store if you wanted to save a game on Zelda. ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE, MICROSOFT.The next problem is the graphics on the PC. I have a custom-made VAIO, the one where you pick the biggest laptop there, choose the blu-ray, most RAM, fastest processor, best graphics card. This laptop eats most games for lunch. Except, of course, GTA IV. Simply moving around in a small area is a chore, the dialogue is stilted, and driving is difficult. I've checked my settings, and the game is demanding maybe a quarter of my computer's resources... and it is STILL a mess. This isn't a performance issue.

Somewhere out there developers have begun lowering the bar on ""standards"" either out of lack of respect for the gaming community, OR they really dont care about their product in general. Either way, the main reason I bought this game was for the ""theatre mode"" which re-plays your saved matches. In other words, you duke it out in the game, and say you pull off a move that takes some serious skills or finess. So, the game offers for you to actually ""SAVE"" THE ""REPLAY"". Great. This way I can go back and see the awesome move I pulled, or even better I can go back and see the moves I missed and learn from where I made my mistakes.Uh uh. Nope. The ""Replay Theatre"" that plays back your matches doesnt play back the matches you play, nor does it play back anything ""YOU"" did. All it does is place the same characters you fight with in the same arena you pick, and it has them auto-fight. It doesn't even record the wins/losses in the match. It re-plays absolutely NOTHING. You can save your combat matches that you play with your friends all you want, when you go to watch your perfectly timed tag-team moves in the replay you save... you are watching a bunch of crap that never ever happened.

I capture video game footage with Roxio. So I played a match, captured the footage, saved the re-play in the game. And as I played the ACTUAL CAPTURED FOOTAGE on my laptop while playing the re-play I saved in the game they were completely different in every way. On my laptop footage I won all the fights with one character in a tag team match. In the saved file of the re-play in the game i lost 2 out of three matches and both my tag team characters were fighting when i never used my partner AT ALL.So the bottom line is this.The Re-play function is NOT a working function of this video game.Yet its advertised by definition of doing something it does not.So they are selling you something that doesnt do what you are supposed to be paying for.Thats poor standards in game development.It doesnt work, and they are selling it anyway.If I knew it didnt work before I purchased it, i wouldnt have bought it.So again, false advertising takes my money.",2,"NOT a ""fully functional"" game ""if"" you buy it.",1358726400,"01 21, 2013"

It was very cheap for a new game, and it sounded kind of cheezy, but I decided to give it a chance.The graphics in the game are very nice, but the cutscenes are not as polished as some games.  However, the game plot kind of pulls you in, making you wonder what's going to happen next.  There are several bosses in the game, none of which I've played yet, but they remind me of Metal Gear Solid bosses.  You are well aware of their presence and powers (each one specializes in one of the various psi powers), and you recognize their abilities as above yours.  This appealed to me as it is building suspense throughout the game.The psi powers are lots of fun.  Telekinesis (reminds me of push/choke of the Jedi Knight games) is a lot of fun.  It can be used on just about every object in the game (and there are always plenty of things to throw).  At one point, I remember seeing a gaurd around the corner, and instead of stepping out and getting in a fire fight, I grabbed an explosive barrel, and threw it blindly around the corner.  It nailed him dead on and cooked him crispy.  The other powers are fun as well.  Mind drain is particularly awesome, because as you drain your enemy his head eventually explodes!!  (the only downside is Mind Drain only works as a stealth kill or on a dead enemy--yielding less power).The game is EASILY played either stealthily or full on war (an element lacking in other games who claim this is possible).  Fighting with guns is decent, though psi powers are funner.  My only complaint is that sometimes I appear to be locked on, and when I unload my gun on an enemy, I end up hitting the top of the box in front of me or something stupid.  You can also only carry one primary weapon (rifle, shotgun, etc.) in addition to your silenced pistol at any one time.Even the simplest moves you are able to perform are fun, and there are several points in the game where you can kill guards in special ways (sucking them into a fan, throwing them in a crematorium furnace).  You get to throw objects at them, use them for cover (not like Splinter cell, but hold them with TK).  You can use Remote Viewing to walk (out of body--thus invisibly) into the next room to scout ahead, and do numerous other things.I wouldn't say it is the best game out there, but it is definitely fun--even if you're just goofin around. The controls are easy easy easy and sometimes it is fun just throwin people around (which is the first power you get).  I give the game an 8/10 because some things felt choppy, and the plot seems sort of half copied half badly written, but nonetheless suspenseful and OK.There is not very much gore--in fact, I think the only gore that is even apparent is when a special kill is made (sucking them into a fan) or when you stealthily Mind Drain a live guard.

Dark Alliance was a chapter in Baldur's Gate's history and this game continues what was started in the first, including many of the same characters and voice talent.To wit, all the efforts in the first game to prevent the teleporting Onyx Towers from falling into the wrong hands was for naught. Mordoc Selanmere (a vampire) has located the towers on the Shadow Plane and manipulates both the Harpers and the Zhentarim into bringing it to the Prime Material Plane so he can teleport right into Baldur's Gate itself and turn all the citizens into shambling undead.Our three heroes from the first game (the elven sorceress, the human archer, and the dwarf) have been captured and apparently are in for a long torture session. Meanwhile, five new heroes are recruited to the cause:* Borador Goldhand: a dwarven treasure-hunter* Alessia Faithammer: an aasimar cleric* Vhaidra Uoswiir: a drow monk* Ysuran Auondril: an elven necromancer,* Dorn Redbear: a human barbarian.My wife chose Vhaidra and I played Ysuran, because they were the most interesting characters. I mean, come on, Dorn Redbear sounds like a Klingon.Vhaidra is known mostly for her sarcastic comments and the inability to walk without crouching like Elmer Fudd. Ysuran is identified mostly by his bare nipples, which he seems to have a pathological need to display at all times. It must be a necromancer thing.The heroes must journey from place to place to retrieve certain items at the behest of various employers, whom ultimately all happen to be connected. The same merchant sells and buys all things with the same annoying and repetitive banter. The twist is that finding masterwork equipment and then augmenting them with gems can improve items. In this way, you can end up with an Exceptional Helmet of Viper's Quickness.Also new to the Baldur's Gate games is the notion of prestige classes. After reaching 20th level and doing enough research about their past (which always costs gold, of course), the characters can join prestige classes. Ysuran's can join Shadow Adept and Vhaidra can join Assassin. These classes give you new nifty abilities. The only problem is that by the time you're 20th level, these abilities are marginally more effective at best.The Baldur's Gate series uses a simplified version of the Dungeons & Dragons game system to good effect. All spells, feats, and class powers have been turned into feats. At each level, characters start with a certain number of points in certain feats. For example, Vhaidra starts with 1 dot in Armor Proficiency, Sprint, and Unarmed Combat. One dot in Armor Proficiency means she can only wear light armor, like leather armor. Role-players, look in horror upon that which is possibly Dungeons and Dragons 4.0!We played the game on Medium difficulty, which was probably a mistake. Ysuran is capable of surviving just fine by himself, because of Skelly.What, you don't know who Skelly is? Why, he's the skeleton that arises from Ysuran's Animate Dead spell. Unfortunately, Ysuran doesn't really animate any dead-Skelly just rises out of the ground and does not require any actual corpses to create him. Another missed opportunity for gaming coolness.The world hates Skelly, but he doesn't seem to care. Every monster in the game has an inexplicable desire to kill Skelly (again), but Skelly just whacks away at them with his bare fists. Fortunately, Ysuran's protection spells extend both to his undead as well. Which really makes them unstoppable. There were a few situations wherein the boss monster killed Vhaidra and Ysuran prevailed with just Skelly and the Life Drain spell.If Skelly makes the game less challenging, the Life Drain spell makes it a cakewalk. In essence, Life Drain inflicts damage and heals Ysuran. However, Life Drain doesn't require any targeting-Ysuran merely needs to point in the direction of his victim and red darts of energy flow out of his foes towards him. Yes, I ate several cookies while Ysuran sucked up the souls of his enemies like a Shop-Vac.Because you can craft magic items, things quickly get out of hand. With enough money, Ysuran had a +4 helmet that protected him from 15 percent of fire, cold, and acid damage. And then because he was such a wuss, I gave him a ring that gave him a +4 bonus to Strength so he could carry all the crap Skelly found.There were some challenges, like the Elemental Plane of Air, where Skelly and Ysuran often fell to their doom. Although really, how long did it take for them to hit ""doom""? It's all Air, right?Dark Alliance II seems to be dumbed down a bit. There are no longer ammunition limits, so ranged weapons effectively fire forever. Stocking up on arrows kept the archer in the first game in check. Here, it's all bolts, all the time.The graphics are more or less the same, although my wife appreciated the fact that most of the main characters didn't seem modeled after certain movie stars (remember the bartender of the Elfsong Tavern, Lady Alyth?). And no, you can't strip down the drow chick to her underwear like you could with Adrianna in the first game.For reasons I cannot comprehend, the map function was moved to the touch pad instead of pushing down on the stick. Since spells are up and down on the touch pad and the map requires pressing to the left (right switches from ranged weapon to two-handed weapon to one-handed weapons), more often than not I brought the map up in the middle of a combat. Please guys, if ain't broke, don't fix it!Baldur's Gate II is an inferior sequel that offers more of the same, only easier. It's probably more entertaining in a single-player game, but it was definitely not balanced for two players. Restricting the necromancer to a single-player might have been a good start.Although I feel obligated to tell you that Skelly thinks that's a stupid idea.",3,"an inferior sequel that offers more of the same, only easier",1100995200,"11 21, 2004"

The whole game just looks beautiful from villages, towns, castles to characters. You will never see a boring looking location or character and the battle animations are top notch as well.The dialogue and story is VERY well written even between regular villagers or people you meet. It also has a bit of humor thrown in. When I entered one INN in a village and talked to the girl behind the counter she said ""I am running the inn because my mother is sick, and NO this is not a start of a medicine fetching quest. You adventurers are all alike."" Or I found a bomb in a treasure chest next to a bed in an INN and the main character stopped and said ""A bomb, at an INN next to the guest bed?""This sort of writing and interaction makes you actually WANT to talk to all the villagers instead of just running through the game doing the main quest.Anyways, pick this one up.

They have entirely eschewed the typical RPG tropes of dialogue trees and progression choices in favour of a linear, non-interactive structure. The story is played out in a series of cut-scenes and simple A to B tasks. Basically you just have to battle your way from one place to the next. There's certainly a place for this type of game, and when it's done well (&aacute; la Half-Life 2) it can be very rewarding. Unlike Half-Life 2, however, ALAN WAKE doesn't quite pull it off. Firstly, there isn't enough humour. There's some but it would have benefited from more. And the story isn't exactly original. But the main problem for me was the combat. I hated the way control is wrenched away from the player every time enemies approach. I get why they did it (there's no other way of knowing they're coming, apart from some audible warnings) but I often found myself disoriented when the camera had finished sweeping around and control had retuned. Several times the sweep lasted so long that by the time I had control again the enemies were right on me and it was impossible to avoid taking a hit. Frustrating to say the least. On the plus side the environments look very good and it's quite atmospheric (although not as creepy as I would have liked - Silent Hill still sets the bar for that). One other thing worth noting is that I found the special episode, The Writer, to be better than what had gone before. It's even more atmospheric and far more inventive.

It has managed to steal the dubious honor previously held by Spider-man 1 as having the absolute worst camera in any video game I've ever played.  This is the first and only game I've ever played which actually gave me motion sickness.  I don't even get sick reading while I'm riding in a car and have never been sick on a plane, so it's really quite an accomplishment.You'll be fighting the camera the whole game.  I couldn't find any way to zoom in or out and when I focused the camera on Laura it would slowly pan out on its own.  Trying to do a jumping puzzle, sometimes the camera will lock in place making jumps much more difficult than they need to be; get used to making many leaps of faith.  If you move around near walls, especially on your motorcycle, the camera will whip to other angles of its own accord.  If you lock on an enemy to attack them, even if you were facing them already, the camera will whip out to another angle once you've finished them off.  Why?  who knows.The camera makes things so bad that the only reason you can still play the game is because there are very few enemies and you have time to keep moving the camera back to where it should be. The presence of a button to snap the camera behind your would have been appreciated.  For an unfathomable reason, while you're moving the controls change to what the current angle is.  In other words, you end up going in a direction other than where you're actually pointing to go.  Say you're holding left, suddenly the camera shifts and you're moving down or whatever.  Left may not be left anymore.  You keep having to stop and start.The controls are the most twitchy I have ever seen. Laura moves like she's on an ice skating rink.  Then you use her motorcycle and you're skidding around like you're oiled up out there on the ice.  It's also wierd to see her sort of hovering a half inch above the ground sometimes when you're pushing things.  Another problem is you will push the controller to go one direction and Laura will fail to move at all or you'll aim in a direction to jump and she'll jump (often to her death) in an entirely different direction.  They try to guide you a little bit with the direction she's looking, but sometimes even that is misleading.  Reading other reviewers I thought they must be exagurating, but no the controls are really that horrifyingly bad.Combat is very limited.  There may be as few as 1 or 2 enemies in an entire level.  You have unlimited ammo, heal fully in a few seconds if you keep away from them, and really enemies don't do all that much damage anyway; it's rare if ever you'll be challenged by them.  One note, the Thrall things (flaming hounds) will keep coming back from the dead unless you shoot them, then go over and press a button to stomp on them while they're down.  The game only tells you this once, and the tip is hard to read.Now for the good stuff.  The levels are well designed, if a bit too much just walking around.  The puzzles are interesting, though often nothing more than flipping a switch a couple times.  The lock-on for the combat is handled well.  Laura looks really good, though a lot of the game is MILF attire; nothing wrong with it, but if I'm stuck looking at her rear the whole game make the outfits skimpy.  The cut scene movies were semi-plentiful and well done.  The story was compelling enough I wanted to finish the game.  Maybe other games had better graphics, but as this is my first encounter with Tombraider I can only say I found the graphics to be perfectly acceptable.All I can say about this game is that I didn't know you could possibly produce something so sloppy, so glitchy, so painful to control, which still manages to be somewhat fun to play.

ME3 took most of what I loved about 2 and brought back some of the good elements from 1 that they had removed from 2, along with adding a few new things of its own.  In short, it was the best of the three games in pretty much every way, a perfect marriage of the best elements of the first two games.  There were a few issues with it, like the poor writing and radically changed character arc for one character in particular (*cough*AshleyWilliams*cough*), but overall it was a great experience for about 30 hours of gameplay (completionist, of course).And then...the ending.  Many others have made much better reviews of how bad the ending was here and elsewhere, so I'll just say that I agree with them.  The ending was (is) terrible, has plot holes, makes no sense, no closure, blah blah blah.  Everything I could say has been said about 500 times already.  Basically, Bioware managed to kill about 100 hours (across all 3 games) worth of time and effort spent in one of the best stories ever found in a game, and they managed to do it in less than ten minutes.  That's the kind of spectacular failure you don't see every day.That said, all is not lost.  The free ""extended cut"" ending DLC that bioware put out as an ""oops, we're sorry"" band-aid fixes most of the gaping plot holes (though it doesn't fix any of the underlying thematic issues the end has), and I'd highly suggest you get it as it greatly increases the likability of the ending.  The excellent Citadel DLC offers a ton of closure as well, though it's closure that will cost you fifteen bucks to get.  Still, I'd say it's definitely worth the price because it is sort of the swan song of the series and is clearly a love letter from Bioware to the fans.  The DLC is  especially good if you play it after the ending scenes as if it's actually the ""real"" ending.  Headcanon FTW!It's really too bad that one of the best video game IPs of the last decade was ruined in minutes by a bad ending.  It's still a series worth experiencing, especially with the two ME3 DLCs I mentioned above.  But I can't bring myself to give this game more than 3 stars.  Ending aside it easily deserves a 4 or maybe even 5 stars, but the ending is just SO bad that it colors everything else.",3,"Great ride, terrible finish, better after DLC",1369526400,"05 26, 2013"

10203,34243,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B00006ZLP8,R.A. McKenzie,"[0, 0]","Indiana Jones doesn't have the strong legacy of video games he deserves.  There've been a handful of successful titles, like ""Fate of Atlantis"" for the PC in 1992, or the SNES game that took all 3 films and crammed them into a fun cartridge.  I'm also a big fan of ""Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"" for the Nintendo, but that's another story.The X-Box version of ""Emperor's Tomb"", however, remains my favorite videogame for this character.  I don't know how it compares to the PS2 version, or if there's a patch for the X-Box 360.  But if you've got one of the original X-Box machines, then this is a game worth owning.I won't boggle you with plot details, suffice to say that this feels very much like an Indy game in terms of location, colorful character, and artifact hunting.  The story, as silly as it is, actually threads together quite well.  You actually wanna know what happens next.  And even if you don't, you're having too much fun to care.The biggest strength of this game is the combat engine.  Even more than 6 years after it first came out, ""Emperor's Tomb"" has very solid brawling mechanics.  It's a blast to punch the bad guys, and it rarely feels clumsy.  There are often weapons lying around for you to use, from guns to clubs.  Breaking a table and using the legs as weapons is my favorite method of punishment; shoving a guy onto a ledge, forcing him to flip far below, is a close second.  The gun combat works relatively well, with an acceptable cover mechanic, and decent hit detection.  There are some occasional clipping issues, but it's so much fun that you won't care.The graphics are still very good.  Character models look nice, and are animated very well.  There are some glitches with characters getting stuck in walls, but they're minor complaints.  There are some creature and environmental effects that are nicely done, and the locations' architechture is crisp.The music is awesome.  John Williams' iconic ""Raiders March"" is used in many ways, from heart-pounding victory to suspensful covert operations.  And the original score composed for the game is excellent; it would've fit perfectly in an Indiana Jones movie.The puzzles are relatively easy to solve, most of them being glorified item-hunting quests.  The platforming and use of the whip is somewhat problematic.  Jumping often involves grabbing onto ledges, and you'll miss some jumps that feel a little cheap.  Thankfully there's a very good checkpoint system in place so that you don't have to retread too much ground.  Whipping is good for platforming, but worthless in combat.  I suppose that makes sense, but it would've been nice for the whip to have a little more effect when facing the villains.The worst aspect of ""Emperor's Tomb"" has to with the levels.  Even though you go to some exciting locations and engage in some neat puzzles & exploration, the levels are simply broken into too many segments.  For example, there's a chapter where Indy must escape a prison in Istanbul Turkey.  But rather than just being a jailbreak, this levels is prolonged into an excavation through the Turkish underground, involving tridents and Krakens and other strange aquatic mythology.  The levels are fun to play through, but they're so long that they interrupt the flow of the story.  After finishing one checkpoint, you'll sigh when you realize the next load screen is yet another room in the same location.  Some may find this repetitive.  I say that it's always great fun to play ""Emperor's Tomb"", if you can accept that there is no logical reason for Indiana Jones to explore as much as he ends up doing.But isn't that a great insult to give to a videogame --- ""It's longer than it needs to be.""  If being lengthy is the worst I can throw at ""Emperor's Tomb"" (along with a few forgivable technical issues), then you should jump right in and grab this one.  The controls are tight.  The combat is fun.  The exploration is gorgeous to look at.  The sound is LucasArts quality.  The Indy adventure would've made an excellent movie with more tightening.  This is the best of the Indiana Jones videogame catalog.I wish I could be more help in getting this to work on an X-Box 360.  But I can promise that however you can play this game, it'll be worth the trouble.  Isn't Indy worth it, after all?",4,Still the Best Indy Game!,1263945600,"01 20, 2010"

No problems whatsoever.  The gameplay is a bit odd.  You need to set the camera to ""Free"" to not feel that you are running around with your head down.  Aside from that, it plays easily, gamers should have no problems.  The idea of not having a number of savegames is annoying at times.  Thing is that you have only one game.  You can't save, try something one way and then reload and try it a different way.  It is like life: No do overs.The problem with this game, IMHO, is it's vapidity and antique quality.  It is a lot like playing an updated Zelda 4.  Interactions are text, characters do not talk to you!!!  It is like earlier games like Ultima Serpent Isle.  There are snippets of speech but not a whole lot.  The quests are juvenile.  There is a landscape inhabited by a never ending variety of thugs, wolves and the like whose reason for being there is non-existant.  The graphics are comic bookie, nothing like Oblivion or Risen.  Speaking of which, it is remarkable that so many years after their release, the Gothic series are still the standard against which games can be held.  In the case of Sacred 2, it is, in many ways a kid game.  You have to work at dieing and the characters are crude.  No detail I mean.The 2 game limit for activation is abhorrent.  One would think that somebody with an ounce of marketing savvy would have quashed that idea as soon as it surfaced.  For that reason, Sacred looses a star.  The slashing gets old and the graphics are poor.  The storyline is banal.  Wish it were better folks.All that nay-saying aside, I think that for $[...] it is worth a tumble.  I am not sure that it will hold our attention to the end but it can be diverting.  Now, in October we will have Gothic 4!!  Till then you can enjoy this comic book excursion.ETA: The text used in the dialog, inventory and everyplace else is very close to unreadable.

IMHO the graphics are just nicer than Madden 2002 especially the facial close up. while Madden made great strides in their audio commentary, it pales in comparison to NFL 2k2's. the response is fairly quick (whereas Madden uses a momentum based response that felt sluggish at times) but i think the game AI makes too much of a jump when you go from rookie to pro and not much of a jump from pro to all-pro.going pro in NFL 2k2 is just much much harder and takes awhile to adjust to... i feel that Madden does a much better job letting you tweek various attributes (help on catching, breaking tackle, defense, etc) within each level. pro mode in 2k2 really punishes you for bad passes. however, the 2k2 AI playmaking overall seems stronger and will run out the clock or call time outs in a realistic manner -- and it won't allow you (except in rookie mode) to run the same types of plays without making you pay for it.the franchise mode is really the main reason i play these games (even though Madden had lot's of great little game drills) and Madden is simply better here.i like the way players grow (or decline) within a season in NFL 2k2 and the ability to trade present and future picks; i also feel that during the signing process, the computer is 'willing' to negotiate in 2k2 (they are willing to sign for less over repeated attempts) where in Madden, it's a cut and dry salary offer. but Madden seems much deeper.with Madden you can create new teams, new players and new stadiums in the franchise mode -- although creating new team/stadiums requires you to replace an existing team/stadium, which help preserve the seasonal matchups. i also feel that Madden have a more realistic allowance for retiring players where in NFL 2k2, you will routinely have the computer retiring players, who haven't been injured and having good seasons, in their prime.overall, i'm glad NFL 2k2 is available for the PS2 and is an enjoyable game. just as i believe Madden learned a lot about what worked in NFL 2k1, the NFL series should take at a good look at Madden 2002.",4,not much improvement over 2k1,1007078400,"11 30, 2001"

Not many games along with the quests, raids, dungeons, have tradeskills you can use to make things and sell at a an auction house or give to your other guild members, or put in a guild bank. Not many others have mail so you can send peoples characters items and money or your own other toons. Overall this is a good game.Cons:They have improved most of the things I complained about in the past, walking five miles in the snow barefoot as a ghost to restore your body without being able to fly there and having the guy you just wasted for a quest respawn so you have to kill him again. There are several more graveyards now, but still not enough to suit me. I can live with that though, but why they felt the need to take away our ability to use our flying mounts that we got in Outlands is beyond me. In Neverend you have to RE-BUY flight (coldweather flight training, please their are cold places in Outland) at level 77 for the ridiculous high amount of $3000 GP. So most of your questing in Neverend to get to level 77 you can't fly. This means riding all over again like you did from level 30-70. Gee, we all enjoyed that so much for forty levels I guess they thought we needed another seven levels of that. Are you people really that dense? There are times I want to get a hold of the people that think these idiotic ideas up at Blizzard. I doubt Blizzard needs all this in-game gold unless they are selling it to the Chinese so they can sell it back to the WoW players. So if you think I hate your Cold Weather Training at level 77 in Neverend you are right Blizzard. It almost made me quit the game.

Fun, that is, if you like military ""simulators"", not just military shoot-em-ups.  It has a few glitches, but overall, it's a great test of patience, nerve, and shooting skill/speed.I have always enjoyed the stealth aspect in games such as Splinter Cell--it's good to change from straight-up shoot-outs every now and then.  Line of Sight feeds that urge in spades.  The combat is all about stealth, and in a tough jungle environment where the enemy has just as much stealth going for him.  The graphics are decent by today's standards, good enough to make you forget about it being only a game, which is the whole point of military simulators.  The atmosphere is top-notch, with the jungle noises, the crunching grass, and the unknown of the enemy, somewhere out there, hidden in the foliage, with a bullet with your name on it.  The action is unforgiving, which turns some people off, but hey, that's the way combat IS.  If you're sloppy, and show yourself to an enemy, you'll likely never know until you feel yourself floating away from your body.  If you're lucky, they may only graze you, giving you the opportunity to go prone and let them come in close to try to finish you off, in which case you return the ""favor"", but make yours the lethal variety.  The night missions are particularly satisfying, because you only have night vision through your scope, just as it was back then.  You move quietly, looking for shapes, or the white of a face, and go to the scope for a better look.  Turn the sound up, too, because the ambience is great, with all the night sounds filling your ears.There are a few oddities that take away from it a bit.  The nastiest one is an annoying tendency for the game to suddenly stand you up out of the prone position every now and then.  In most cases, this is merely annoying, but occasionally it necessitates a restart, because you just jumped up right in front of the enemy!  The enemy AI can be ""interesting"", with their ability to know your exact location from one shot, and to be able to cross ""hill-n-dale"" in mere seconds, regardless of the ruggedness of the terrain.  Your partner will occasionally get stuck or lost, which means you must go back for him, because you cannot complete the missions without him next to you.  In general, while these can be annoying, the gameplay makes up for them, and with a running quick-save ability, you should never have to go back too far if you're taken out prematurely.Overall, I am very impressed with this game.  It's a sleeper hit, having flown under too many radars, and yet be this good.  Any time a game can glue you to the screen, keeping you on the edge of your seat, peering into the monitor like it's a window looking out over the woods and you know someone is out there, someone with evil intentions for you, and you must find them first--that game developer did their job VERY well indeed!  The complaints about its difficulty are justified, but not without being able to overcome them.  I am NOT a hardcore gamer, but I like reality in my games, and combat SHOULD be unforgiving of mistakes.  You adjust your tactics, you take it slowly, stop and listen, go prone the second you hear noises or voices, and you be ready to shoot quickly and accurately.  If you liked Ghost Recon (especially the Advanced Warfighter series) and/or Splinter Cell, you owe it to yourself to try this one out--I bet you'll have a blast with this!Oh, for the record, I have Vista 64-bit, and this plays fine--don't miss it because you have upgraded your system.",4,Tough and authentic...with a couple hickups,1251763200,"09 1, 2009"

It's your job to convert as many people in the game before Jesus returns.The only way to get more characters on your side is to convert them. Hence, the spiritual warfare aspect of the game. You can train your converts to be pastors, missionaries, gospel singers, prayer warriors etc. you can also have them build buildings to house more converts to train, house and feed them. This sounds like a lot of micromanaging and it is. The point and click aspect is only fun for so long. Not to mention the fact that the Ai is a little dim and you constantly have to tell them what to do without them doing it themselves.One nice part of the game is its mapped view of New York City. However the streets feel constricted so you cannot move your otherwise enormous army around very easily. Plus even though New York is mapped, there are limited varieties of the buildings. That might be okay if you could earn them but the game only lets you get what it will let you.The characters all look the same even after you convert them. They do change to the same outfit after awhile but it's still a pain to tell them apart.The game does offer online play but only to play as the peacekeeping forces. You also gain access to all their powers. Like doctors and colleges-oh I'm so scared!The game is well crafted to be a decent RTS game without being annoying on the Christian angle. This is at least more interesting than The Bible Game. But I still give it the same score because of the poor graphics, micromanagement and repetitive, boring game play.

4172,33970,A3178K9AHMHCQV,B00006N5SO,Luminus,"[14, 19]","The developers of this game dropped the ball like a ton of bricks.  Don't get me wrong.  The idea was cool: Four characters, each with their own technique and weapons, trying to rid the world of zombies and other possessed creatures.  But, believe me, that's where the excitement ends.From what I hear, playing this with 3 friends is where the fun lies, but if you're going alone, the only reasonable character choice is Duece.  He is the strongest and has the most reach with his axe.  You'll find that he is the ONLY one capable of handling the endless amount of enemies that appear out of nowhere, which is one of the game's biggest problems.The enemies keep respawning.  What's the point of killing tens of monsters, if they're only going to respawn seconds later?  It's repetative and pointless.  There's almost nothing worse than fighting through an area only to find that the same people you killed a moment ago keep coming back.Another HUGE problem with this game is the camera angles.  You have zero control over it.  All this game allows you is a zoom in feature, which only serves to make your experience worse.  Countless times I found myself turning a blind corner and having to actually walk a few seconds before the camera allowed me to see down that path.  That's the kind of thing that gets you needlessly killed.Next, we have the bosses.  Okay, so who's bright idea was it to make bosses so cheasy?  The first boss I fought had a horde of monsters helping him kill me, and none of them were moving slow enough for me to think too hard.  The second one, a Teddy Bear, wouldn't stop chasing me.  I had to literally run around in circles, avoiding killer spirits, while occasionally jumping to avoid Teddy Bear induced earth quakes and vomit, all the while trying to get a shot with my special weapon.  You literally only have seconds to get that one shot off.  By the way, if you run out of ammo for that special weapon, just restart, because you will not defeat that leader with anything else.  Sound like fun?  I didn't think so.The next problem is the cycling of the weapons.  During the game, I found that it takes certain weapons to destroy certain creatures.  For example, the spirits and gargoyles cannot be killed with guns and the spiders and alligators cannot be killed with blunt strikes, unless you want to die, of course.  I've tried and it resulted in either my death or a huge loss of energy.  It's a nice concept, but you'll find yourself running back and forth as you try to cycle from one weapon to another as you attempt to rid yourself of deadly spiders as the spirits are coming at you simultaneously.The final problem is the need to reload your special weapon.  Okay, I understand this concept, but then ammo is not easy to come by.  Why couldn't they just make this like Blood Rayne and give you the chance to reload when you kill someone who has a gun?  Also, why does the chainsaw have such a short limit?  It's not like it does any more damage than your regular weapon.So basically, the game sucks.One more thing.  The guy that does the voice for the mysterious dark creature that tells you why this happened sounds like the Mayor of Grant City in Dead to Rights.  They sound exactly the same, in fact, only this character is overly melodramatic.",1,Who thought this was fun?,1081382400,"04 8, 2004"

The Conduit has some flashy graphics and they really do look good and the only thing that hurts the graphics is the sometimes bland level design.Unfortunately the online multiplayer is going to be great to some and decent to others. I was plagued with this glitch/bug where I kept loading into walls upon the first match. Now its not all a big fuss as you can do one of two things and that is wait for the match to be over or you can turn your Wii off and try again. I usually just wait it out as I am patient. There was a rumor that the Wii 4.2 upadate fixed this glitch but as of Nov. 9, 2009 I still experience this problem. Since I am plagued with this nearly every time I go online it does hurt the overall score as I have no other problems running any games online for the Wii. At the same time though its not a total game breaker for me because they have some good online modes and a few good maps.Overall I think the Conduit could of used a little better level design to show off there flashy graphics and I feel this way because its not HVS first FPS but it is there first FPS on the Wii. I do not mind linear gameplay as long as its fun and the Conduit is fun but the replay value only comes in small doses for me. I play this game online maybe once a month and thats for an hour or so.Note this is an edited review. Disregard the June date.",4,Very good FPS on the Wii,1245801600,"06 24, 2009"

And I have read many other reports of bugs like this. Perhaps EA thinks that this will have me buying Madden 10, but trust me, that is not the consumer reaction at this juncture.Be warned if you pick up a used copy of this game that it likely has the bug as well.As far as game play goes, there are absolutely no improvements in this version over previous ones. It's still painfully hard to rush the quarterback no matter how intense your DL. It's still ridiculously easy to run up the score with your passing game. Improving players in the dynasty game is now based on tedious practice sessions rather than once-a-year training camp, and the improvements are nominal.And Chris Collinsworth's color commentary is muddy.

Anyway after playing it reminded me of a game that looked like it originated from this game. Conker's Bad Fur Day. I played through the game and I finally seen how long it is. Super long. It can also be challenging at times. This game is playable in co-op if you find this robot named Floyd and search for his missing components (and they are nearby.) The multiplayer is fun and has many unlockables. My few problems were that when you delete the previous game file(s) it won't delete the unlockable characters. Aming can also be hard at times. The game may occur with slow downs sometimes, but it rarely bothers me that much. I say the multiplayer, unlockables,  and easter eggs, are the best about the game. There is much to do in the game. In multiplayer there aren't any bots, but if you wanna get together with friends and play; the modes are really fun. The game is similar to Conker's Bad Fur Day modes, but this game came first. There is racing, third-person shooting, and target practice all up to four players. You can unlock a lot more levels, and characters for the game even though most of my characters were already unlocked. Anyway I like to say this game can be really fun and boring at times. If you have time to spend with the single-player throughout your days, and you love long games, or just like unlockable features; buy this game. It is a nice adventure.

10677,127951,AJNSNYZA8XP9T,B002BCQ7NE,KnicksCrazy2537,"[7, 12]","I recently wrote a review listing reasons why I did not care so much for NBA 2k10 (granted some of these issues could be fixed through a simple patch from the 2k sports network).  On the other hand, there is not enough room on this page for me to list the things that are wrong with NBA Live 10.  The reason I bought NBA Live 10 in the first place was because I was not completely satisfied with 2k10, but now it is evident I just wasted even more money.  First off, the graphics in NBA Live are awful.  The best way I can describe to you how the players in NBA Live 2010 are portrayed would be by saying they look to be drawn about one step better than stick figures.  On your TV the players, especially the smaller guards, look like little hangmen running across your screen.  The presentation of the game is bad as well. For instance, I played a home game as the Knicks and Marv Albert started the game off by saying ""Life from the New York Arena, its the Orlando Magic and the New York Knicks.""  The New York Arena?????? Are you serious EA sports????  Madison Square Garden is not only considered the world's most famous arena but it is also a place where every basketball player, whether they are in middle school, high school, or college, dreams of playing!  With that being said you would assume (especially since you are a person who is willing to shell out [...] bucks for a game) that a franchise like NBA Live would incorporate at least the title of the arena in the game.  Yeah well what did your parents and teachers tell you about assuming things??  Exactly.  The crowds in the arenas are also unrealistic.  Every fan in the crowd appears to be making the same motions and gestures at the exact same time.When you finally come to your senses and get over the fact that Marv Albert (who for a long time served as the Knicks play-by-play announcer) just referred to Madison Square Garden as the New York Arena, you get into the actual game itself.  I would suggest buying a few replacement controllers because you will have thrown at least one or two of them into a wall or window by the time you can get through a full game.  The amount of turnovers in this game is totally out of control.  If you so much as even think about driving into the lane-don't, because your player will lose the ball almost every time.  I like or should I say ""liked"" (since I do not play the game anymore) to play an inside-out game; where you drive the lane and kick it out for open threes.  The passes in this game seem to always get intercepted and just lead to more frustration.I believe the reason there is such a huge debate on which game is better (NBA 2k10 or NBA Live 10) is the fact that they are both so bad.  It is not a debate on which game is more fun, it is a debate on which game i less flawed.  In my opinion, there will never be another NBA video game as enjoyable as NBA 2k9 was.  I wish I could play that game all the time with new, updated rosters each season.And by the way if you decide to go ahead and buy this game anyway, and you enter an online match and your opponent chooses to play as the Magic, just save yourself a lot of anger and back out right away.  In this game for some reason Jameer Nelson does not miss a shot and Dwight Howard is impossible to stop and dunks on everyone.  You would think Jameer had donated some money for the creation of NBA Live 10, although it probably wasn't much since you alreaddy know my opinion on the finished product.I just wish someone would have wrote this review before I decided to purchase both NBA 2k10 and NBA Live 10.

The controls are very simple - you only use the left and right analog sticks to navigate through your brightly colored, exceedingly cluttered environment. What really adds to the enjoyment of this game is the sound. Every object you pick up lets out a unique sound as it's unapologetically absorbed into your ball of junk, and it's quite amusing. Furthermore, the soundtrack is catchy and upbeat, and you're sure to get the songs stuck in your head for hours (days, weeks, months...lol).

You've got the varied enemies, the nice backdrops and the beautiful soundtrack, but it feels all too linear to me.  Sure, you can re-play levels after gaining new skills, but it's not like the old castlevania where you had to back-track or navigate using a map system.  My other turn-off were the upgrades.  Instead of upgrading equipment, you upgrade skills, which in turn, makes the game heavily reliant upon combat button combinations.  Somehow, this all reminds me of Dantes Inferno.  The environments are great, but it's obvious that there is only one path to go on and it's a lot of short-lived levels.  The enemies may look different, but they are all played very much the same.  I got bored rolling around and slashing or fighting giants via 'Shadow of Collosus'.

Pirates rule the waters of the Caribbean and have established a lawless Republic. Among these outlaws is a lethal young captain named Edward Kenway. His notorious exploits earn the respect of legends like Blackbeard, but draw him into an ancient war that may destroy everything the pirates have built for themselve.I got my Butler to go and buy the game for me @ Midnight and when he got back I started to play the game and all I can say about this is : It'll keep you entertained for minutes.There's nothing different about this AC than any of the others apart from the Pirate theme with all the sailing on the high seas.sword fighting and Pirate murder fighting anything that moves and swimming underwater with sharks and all matter of other weird sea life.If this floats your boat then this is the game for you , without a shadow of a doubt.you could say it's a GTA on water only far better than GTA because that just sucks every single one of the hundreds of different GTA games that are out there are exactly the same steal cars , shoot people & robb people.that can only stay interesting for so long before it's time to say enough is enough.Assassins Creed is alot more skilfull and so will you need to be in order to play it and play it well.you don't just spend all the time sailing the high seas in this game there are also some missions on land.put there more for a change of scenary I think,to keep people playing the game a bit longer by having different visuals something to excite their eyes (Eye cand if you like) stops them from getting bored so quickly.the game took me about an hour to complete and I have the proof on Youtube so go and look if you don't believe me.The best thing about this AC is the fact you can go explore underwater it has increased the game playing field considerably which can only be a good thing.more space to run around aimlesly discovering stuff you don't need to discover which you'll have no use for in the game.Still sound good ? Read on then.underwater you'll encounter such hazards as sharks, the piranhas, the stingrays, the jellyfish and if none of thes things kill you the lack of air certainly will.The first time I played this and went underwater I got eaten alive by sharks but it didn't take me long to learn from my mistakes,and next time I went swimming I went swimming prepared for this .I went swimming with my trusworthy sword and cut the sharks head of and then it didn't really give me much bother after that.The game features a few different game modes which are : Artifact,Domination,Manhunt and Wanted.You'll have to play them and decide foir yourselves which is your favourite but mine has to be :Wanted which is basically a free for all where each player is given a contract to kill one of the other players.Hope this has been as enjoyable for you as it has been for me,see you next time.And remember : ""Calm Down Son,It's Only A Review""There you go...I've light the touch paper so now all that's left for me to do is stand back and watch the losers moan .",1,Hitman this ain't,1394928000,"03 16, 2014"

I am happy to say my fears were unfounded. Bravely Default is an amazing RPG that channels the best of the Final Fantasy series without feeling like it is standing on its shoulders.It&#8217;s as if Squeenix drafted a team of long time Final Fantasy fans and let them put whatever they wanted into the game (except the name Final Fantasy in the title). I went in expecting a shallow time-waster that would feel like a FF5 clone. This is not true at all. My biggest surprise is how much I enjoyed the story and grew to like the characters. The overall tone is more lighthearted than, say, FF7 but B.D. still manages to deliver a fun narrative that keeps you playing. This includes surprisingly sharp dialogue and genuinely funny exchanges (such as Edea&#8217;s pronunciation of &#8220;Mrgrgr!&#8221; and her frequent bickering with Ringabel).The narrative is not the only thing that will keep you playing, though. Everything else is great, too, from the voice acting to the music, visuals & gameplay. The whole brave/default system is a brilliant idea which breathes new life into turn-based combat. It goes very well with the large number of jobs you can unlock.I could go on for quite a long time naming all the features I love about this game, but suffice it to say that you will like it if you are an old school Final Fantasy fan or a RPG fan in general. If you already have a 3DS it is a must play and if you don&#8217;t have one and like RPGs, you should think long & hard about getting a 3DS. If Squeenix is going to continue sinking the FF series into the toilet, then B.D. is a wonderful start for a new series that can be its successor.",5,Exceeded all of my expectations,1392940800,"02 21, 2014"
11845,155428,AIVJB0CQ4N6R7,B003MUNG0G,Andrew Kamerosky,"[6, 8]","This came takes all the great aspects of the first and throws them out the window with no regard.  Plot, graphics & animations, computer controlled enemies and allies, and game play are seriously hindered, lacking, or not thought out at all.  Please, do not purchase this game or pay full price, you will be wasting hard earned money.The plot, oh the plot.  They ripped off sections of popular games such as the AC-130 gunning, attempted to do the ""multiple story lines that converge"" method of plot, and clearly did not put much effort in telling a coherent story.  As with most Clancy games, there is an overall story line that spans from EndWar to Ghost Recon.  This game I guess is taking place in an alternative reality that ignored what happened in the previous game and all other games in this universe. Not to mention complete disregard for logic, in several parts of the game your fighter is not armed with missiles for no discernible reason, aircraft carriers double as landing craft, and its an acceptable choice to sink oil tankers. So, if story isn't such an issue for you, there are more reasons to not like this.The graphics of this game are definitely lack luster and not on par for its generation of games.  In cut scenes the lips of the characters don't sync up with speech, a really, really, dumb failure.  This sort of characterizes the game, it just seemed like the design group didn't care.  The maps are big but the models still look like they came out of a game years ago, small details I know but when you keep crashing into fuzzy poles, it gets annoying. The use of real maps is overhyped and a gimmick at best. The scales never seem right and I'm pretty sure they just threw the models in at random. But wait, there's more!Your computer allies clearly take the ""if I stay away from danger, someone else will deal with it"" approach to combat.  In HAWX 1, you could tell your wingmen to cover you or go out and engage.  In this game, you are almost always a wingman and the only times you are a lead is when you are by yourself.  So, don't count on your allies to watch out for you or help complete objectives or support craft to fire at anything.  The enemies though take full advantage of the good old lazy programmer approach of infinite ammo.  You will have portions of the game where you will endless circle, trying to lock on with the guns because missiles are ineffective against what seems to be flare infused fuel in your target's engine.  The game's story was clearly balanced for multiplay with three of your friends (Assuming you have three friends with this game) being able to handle the vast number of enemies being thrown at you.  This brings me to the last part of shortcomings.You have no alternative control layouts, ability to change sensitives, or choice of aircraft.  The game was meant to be played with a joystick.  Like the mech game that required a giant $100 controller to play it properly, this game was designed for those of you who play lots of flight games and have put down the cash for a joystick.  For the rest of us, deal with it.  You will find yourself just flying in random loops, dodging endless missiles, and being thrown off by the very jumpy controls.  Push the stick a little too hard and before you know it you are hugging a tree, hard.  Then another ""If it worked in the first game we shouldn't do it"" moment was with the no choice of planes and loadouts.  I can understand from a story point of view that Russians won't field US planes or when expecting flying CAS you won't have bombs.  But by denying players the option of choosing to forgo the radar guided missiles (Good luck keeping those on target) for multi-AA missiles you just frustrate everyone. Oh and the landing/takeoff/mid-air-refuel stuff, it got old after the first time.  Expect to spend minutes with the assistant thing (They also wrecked this system, its useless) trying land to end a mission.  If I wanted to do those things, I would play a realistic fighter game.Overall, this is a frustrating way to spend your time.  If you're patient, more power to you.

An ACT is a long range, nearly sniper, pistol. Gimping the range by handicapping marksman mode and improving the reticule while moving seems a horrible idea, but I use my purple* ACT 44 about as much as I do my Joker or FBW. It's a good gun but the mods make it more a jack-of-all rather than a specialty weapon.

I've bought lifetime scoped NTEC with real cash.

5048,54538,AE1OP60IC5O82,B0007ZSHOY,truster38,"[3, 4]","""Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones"" is a great Strategy RPG, not just for the GBA but for any system.  This is somewhat unsurprising, since the ""Fire Emblem"" series was developed decades ago and has been a fixture of Nintendo consoles since the original NES.  The first FE to grace our shores was the seventh title in the series, ""Blazing Sword,"" which was released as simply ""Fire Emblem"" here.  That was an excellent, challenging, and quite long game with a first-rate story (although the fact you were an actual character, of sorts, didn't jive with some people).  Nintendo's decision to introduce North Americans to the FE series with that game was, in retrospect, somewhat surprising, since it was actually a prequel to the sixth FE game, ""The Sword of Seals.""  ""The Sacred Stones"" is the eighth game in the series, and this is the one for the mainstream.  You get three difficulty levels right off the bat, the option of choosing two different lords with different stories, and a story that, while still good, is noticeably smaller in scale compared to the epic narrative of the last game.  Even with the three difficulty settings, any seasoned FE player will tell you the real challenge is choosing to abuse or not abuse various aspects of the gameplay.  For example, it is clear in SS that one of the main lords, Ephraim, is probably the strongest lord character yet in a FE game, I'd say even stronger than Hector.  He definitely bucks the trend of ""weak FE lords.""  Eirika, on the other hand, is probably one of the weakest.  You can also use the ""abuse Arena"" trick to quickly level up your characters and buildup funds (something SS really doesn't let you do).  In addition, new gameplay mechanics force the player to enact new choices.  For example, there is a new system in SS where you get to choose which class to change a character to.  Which class is right for that particular character depends mainly on how well you can read their stat levels.  However, some classes are much, some would say too much, better than others.  For example, you can change your pegasus knight into either a falcoknight or a wyvern knight.  Wyverns are known for their good defense against melee weapons but weak resistance against magic.  But, pegasus knights have high resistance.  So, each pegasus knight you change into a wyvern knight gains the aforementioned melee adeptness as well as retains their original high magic resistance.  Another example is the Bishop class.  Many of the enemies you will encounter in SS are monsters.  Bishops gain an ""always-on"" skill called ""Slayer,"" which makes their attacks especially effective against monsters.  Why would you choose any other class?  After all, FE has really always been about, namely, who has the better weapon (although some would say the weapons triangle and trinity of magic makes things a bit too extreme, as what weapon a character wields also affects seemingly unrelated things like evasion).  There is a class, Assassin, that isn't even mentioned in the instruction manual, which is bound to cause confusion among novices.  Speaking of weapons, you will find that, mainly because of who your enemies are, some weapons are just more effective than others.  For examples, in SS, there aren't enough strong enemy axe wielders around, so lances are the most useful of the melee weapons.  As mentioned before, light magic seems to be the most effective, not just because of monsters, but because it always seems to work best against the game-end bosses.  Perhaps this is necessary, as light magic is strong against dark magic, and, of course, evildoers more than likely will be using dark magic.  Even so, the question must be raised: why even have S-rank weapons for every weapon class then?  If only two or three of them are going to be effective for the boss, why have so many at all?  I, for one, don't like the feeling of using my S-rank weapon against a few grunts.  These questions certainly don't just apply to SS.  Something in SS that everyone will, except diehard knight and cavalry fans, agree on is the improved effectiveness of the flying units.  In FE7, the flying units seemed to be really underpowered.  Though I suspect this probably has to do most with the fact there are less enemy archer units in this game, it's still nice to have Vanessa be the one to take down the Demon King in this game instead of watching Florina die over and over and over in the last game.  We'll see what the next FE, a GameCube game called ""Path of Radiance,"" is like, though I hope to see this series go to the DS soon.  Maybe a new character class change system will be implemented where the character will automatically change into a class the game deems it best suited to being, based on combat habits and techniques.

670,141132,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B002I0JBL4,Ian,"[9, 14]","We never thought it would happen...Endless restarts.  The all-time champion of vaporware.  And a game that, for the longest time, seemed doomed to forever remain in limbo.But now, 14 years later, the king is back.Duke Nukem Forever is finally here.Right off the bat, it should be said that, even with it's lengthy development time, Duke Nukem Forever will never, ever live up to the hype that's been over a decade in the making.  Much like ""Star Wars:  The Phantom Menace,"" ""Forever"" is going up against expectations years in the making.  To come even close to matching them is an exercise in futility.  And in the light of hype, the only way Duke could ever hope to succeed was to focus on being a fun and enjoyable game.And I'm happy to report that, for the most part, Duke Nukem Forever succeeds.Taking place many years after the conclusion of the previous Duke Nukem game, ""Forever"" finds Duke doing what he always does:  Indulging his massive ego, grabbing all the sex he can from steamy college co-eds, managing his massive casino on the Las Vegas strip, and autographing copies of his book, ""Why I'm so Great.""  However, one day, aliens once again come down to earth and start stealing all the hot babes.  In light of such an insult, Duke returns to action once more, to save Earth, preserve freedom, but most importantly...to save all the hot chicks.In many ways, ""Forever"" is a game that has seemingly traveled through time from the mid-1990's.  Aside from the obvious graphical upgrade, not much has changed since Duke's first 3D adventure...he runs, he shoots aliens and cracks one liners.  He does everything a shooter is supposed to do, but at the same time, ""Forever"" isn't really all that different from any other shooter you'd find on today's market.  The only thing that really makes it stand out is Duke himself:  Whether you love or loathe him, there's no denying that Duke is one of the most colorful personalities in the FPS genre, offering more humor and personality then Master Chief, Gordon Freeman (There are, of course, jokes related to the two in the game), or other countless FPS protagonists.In a way, this is the best part of ""Forever"":  It's a blast to see Duke's monstrously high opinion of himself (he even has a museum set up to immortalize how awesome he is), to hear his witty one liners, jokes, and watching other people react to him, which run along the lines of, ""Holy s*** it's Duke Nukem!  We're saved!""  ""Forever"" doesn't take itself seriously at all, and offers a lot of juvenile humor, from strippers, giant breasts on the walls (that you can slap), to jokes about games in general; aside from the mentioned gags against Halo and Half life, you'll find references to Dead Space, Leroy Jenkins, annoying puzzles, and even hints that show up on loading screens (""Take less damage to avoid being killed."").  And if you read some of the items that show up in the game (sauce containers, boxes, etc.) you'll find descriptions that are laugh out loud funny (I loved the one about Oompa Loompas).Aside from the humor, ""Forever"" boasts some really creative missions and scenarios:  One of my favorites include occasionally being shrunk down and having to go through ordinary locations while being the size of an action figure, which can lead to massive gunfights between six inch tall enemies on kitchen shelves, complete with miniature guns and cans being tossed back and forth.  I also really enjoyed the driving stages, and the underwater sequences were certainly unique.  There are also some awesome set pieces, but I won't describe them, to avoid spoiling the surprise.Sadly however, humor and creativity will only take a game so far, and despite all the years in development, ""Forever"" still has some serious problems.Among Nukem's biggest problems isn't the graphics (which I thought were a bit plain in some areas, but were fine overall) or the story (which is bare bones, but it doesn't affect the game negatively), but rather, the difficulty, lack of direction, and annoying boss fights.  ""Forever,"" even on the normal difficulty setting, is a surprisingly tough game.  It's not impossible by any means, but as the game goes on, you're going to be bombarded by enemies who can kill you in a matter of seconds, and often show up in packs, which leads to a LOT of annoying deaths at the hands of annoying enemies, including pigcops, teleporting jet-pack wearing soldiers, and those damn octobrains.Leading into the difficulty is the boss fights.  While every boss you face is absolutely gigantic in size, most of them resort to cheap tricks and annoying strategies to make your life hell, such as sending several of their minions to battle you, as is the case with a boss battle that took place on a moving catwalk, which was almost impossible for me to beat, due to being killed very quickly.  It's a real shame too, as the second to last boss could have been one of the best fights I've ever gone through, but it's fast attacks make it more annoying then fun (Duke's painfully slow swimming speed didn't help, either).While the first half of the game is quite creative and clever in many ways, that feeling fades about halfway through, as the game recycles objectives (hunting for gas gets old quickly), and the game becomes a generic hallway shooter that has you going through concrete hall after concrete hall.  It doesn't help that there are some points where the game isn't clear on where you're supposed to go; there were several points where, upon completing an objective or receiving one, I wasn't given any hints on where to go, and would wander around for several minutes before finding a well hidden switch or ladder.  It never got to the point where I had to look at an online FAQ for help, but it was annoying.Still, despite these flaws, I did enjoy ""Forever.""  While I did get really frustrated and annoyed at times, the charm and humor kept me going, as did the creative set pieces, and of course, playing as Duke (again voiced to perfection by Jon St. John) was a blast.  While the game doesn't have a whole lot of replay value (it does have some nice unlockables, though), I did enjoy my time playing through it, and once the game was over, I was satisfied.  Not ecstatic or disappointed, but satisfied.""Forever"" is not going to innovate the gaming industry.  It doesn't have much to offer that's new, but the game fully embodies the macho spirit of the 90's, and knows what it wants to do:  To blow stuff up and have fun doing so, and for the most part, it succeeds.  It may not be all that great, but to me, it's at least worth a rental.

9561,214865,AXPA3OIZFWLLE,B00AY1CT3G,spirestar,"[23, 34]","In order to make this Madden review as helpful as possible, it's broken up into separate sections: General, Single Player, and Multiplayer & General Game Play Notes. Let me know if you have a question in the comments, and I'll address it ASAP!General Overview:The Madden franchise has been viewed with (justifiable) trepidation from fans for several years. It seems every version has major bugs ('11) or bad game play tweaks ('12) or completely missing functionality (Offline Co-op Franchise in '13). The good news is: Madden 25 is a noticeable step forward from Madden '13 in almost every way. I would certainly put this game in the ""buy"" category, which is saying something after my scathing review of '11. It does still have some minor problems, though, and these are noted in the sections below.Graphics: The animations and graphics are smoother.Sound: It seems to be a bit improved, but this could be coinciding with my use of improved headphones. The commentary audio still makes silly mistakes (like calling you a moron for going for it on 4th-and-long when you're down by 6 with less than a minute to go). I turned the commentary off after just an hour.PS3 vs Xbox 360: For the group of players wondering whether they should buy for the PS3 or Xbox 360, go with your controller preference. There isn't a lot of difference otherwise. On the PS3, there seems to be a fraction-of-a-second lag in some menus and just after calling a play. There have been multiple times that I have tried inputting defensive adjustments immediately after calling a play only to have the first button press not take effect. This issue does not seem to be predictable, but it seems to occur more when there are ""presentation"" graphics on the screen. This issue does not seem *quite* as noticeable on the Xbox 360, but that could be my imagination. The Xbox 360 version does seem to be just a little smoother in menu navigation. As far as game play goes, the two are virtually identical.Single Player:The missing features that many Madden fans were angry about last year have been included from the jump (rather than being added on as an afterthought to appease the torch-bearing mob). The fantasy draft is back, offline co-op franchise is included, and importing a draft class from NCAA '14 is restored!The AI isn't particularly improved on offense or defense from what I can tell. Winning at any difficulty level will not be hard for most players.Multiplayer & General Game Play Notes:This is the mode that keeps me buying Madden year after year, and it's easiest to tell where the game's strengths and weaknesses are while playing online.Offense:Game play has been tweaked with the inclusion of useable option plays (`13's option plays were too slow-developing to be of use).The Precision Modifier (L2) button makes the control scheme a little more involved, but most players will consider it a welcome addition. Using this new functionality makes whatever command the ball-carrier uses more effective. Jukes are more pronounced, stiff-arms more vicious.The new audible system allows the user to call 4 plays in the current formation or select any other formation with the same personnel. I like it quite a bit after getting used to it.There seem to be many more un-bumpable routes this year. Slot wheel routes are virtually unstoppable against man or zone, and coverage AI probably needs to be turned up in a patch to fix this. I'm already seeing it exploited regularly.Defense:Underpowered again, just like every year. The fact that everyone has to deal with it doesn't really make it easier to swallow.As usual, almost any zone coverage loses to almost any pass route combination because AI defenders don't really ""pay attention"" to receivers near their zones (the last time they did was Madden '10).I was afraid mobile QBs would run absolutely wild with the inclusion of the option. Thankfully, EA included functionality rendering the read option relatively easy to stop. Telling the DE to take the QB (triangle in the pre-snap menu) and mopping up the RB yourself works very well. It will be interesting to see if this changes over the course of the game.Press coverage just doesn't seem as effective this year.I hold out some hope that there will be patches to make the defense at least a little better.Overall: Madden 25 is not perfect, but I've given up on expecting perfection. I'm pretty happy with this 4-star effort and feel it is the best-in-franchise since Madden '10. You may experience moments of frustration, especially on defense, but this is the most enjoyable Madden I've played in four years.",4,Madden 25: A step in the right direction,1377561600,"08 27, 2013"

12207,47453,A13HCM8RN6ZNNC,B00023XXMM,Raul,"[23, 31]","First of all, let me tell you that this is not the best chess program available in the market. For some profesional or tournaments players, chess master 10 is not a very strong program, if you compare it with names like Fritz, Tiger, Shreder, etc.In my opinion, chess master is a very goog program, but not the best. It's weak in some areas, like bas opening's, weak in the enda game, an a huge diferen in the style of play.The cons are:1.- Academy.- this part is for me, the best one. Is a MUST for the beginers or the amateur player's. In it, chess master explain to you how to move your pices, and the basis of chess, like the principles of the opening, midel game and enda game. In this part you can learn the best move to open a game, the tactis in the midle game (forks, pins, doble atack ), and the basis of the endgame ( how to mate whit the queen, rok, bishops, the oposition). All of this is covered in a very instructive ways, and a lot of examples, and test that you have to pas if you whant to advance a litle further. This area is dedicated for the beginers.2.- Kid section.- As this name indicated, ypou have acces to play against kids whit diferent ages and strenghts. Some are 7, 8, 9 or 10 years old. Each and every one, having diferent playing style. Also in this section you can chose ches boards in 3-D. This section is fun for the litle ones and don't represent any oposition for themore sesoned players.3.- Players.- There are many players you can chosse. Fron grand masters like Alekhine, Tal, Fisher, Karpov, to kids who are very easy to defet. You can play against any one if you decide to try a casual and no rated game.4.- Time.- After you select your oponetn you decide the time (Blitz, Normal, Tournament, Suden death, any one you ewant), 5.- 5.- Chess sets.- after this you have to chose your chess set (there are a lot of chess sets to chose, and all are very well done. If you are not a beginer there are a lot of sets you can chosse, whit no sofisticated figures. I preferd this one, because tehre are some chess sets when is very dificult to see the diference betwen the quen and the king, the pawns and the bishops.6.- Tournaments and rated games.- For starting your ""carrer"", you hace to enter your rating, mine in real life is abour 1880, fron then you have the posibility to participate in diferent tournaments, al depending on your rating. The ones whit a rating of 900 to 1200 are very easy. I recomend to you that start your rating as low as you can, in this way you can participate in all tournaments, win more rting points, and unlock a lot of ches sets. The only way to unlock a very beatiful chess sets in wining tournaments.If you don't want to participate in tournaments, there is other way to gain rating points. Is playing a rated game. To star you decide your rating and then chosse an oponent you want. You can't chosse any one, only the one's who are close to your rating. Then is presentend tou yo a table, saying how many ponits you're gona a win if you defet your oponent, how many if you draw and how many your gone a lost if you lose. If you start your rating for 800 or 900 the oponets are some times kids or player whit a litle strength. In this model of play you can chose the time and the chess sets. For me is beter to play a 5 or 10 minutes game (blitz), that way the game is more shorter, because, as in the real life, some players take huge time to think about his move, and for me is not very confortable to spend time in front a computer when the position is totaly won for me. I aready played more than 150 games and in all NONE OF MY OPONENTS HAVE RESIGNED!!!!, you have to mate them to win the game or win by time, that's the reason i gave you the advice to play in shorten time, in one ocasion i decide to played a game in 2 hours, in the firts 25 moves, and 30 minutes of play, my oponet lost the queen and never resingned, after 1 hour, mine 20 minutes, 40 the computer, i won the game.7.- Base.- the chess master 10 have a big database whit many games you can reproduce. This section is ideal for the ones who are starting the game, because it shows you the way the grand master and the beter chess players in the world played their games.In all, i recomend this program to all the beginers, but not for a tournament player, because your not have a very good oposition.",3,Not for a serius chessplayer.,1119312000,"06 21, 2005"
3918,95149,A12WZTC4YJ8ZEC,B000X1PE16,Ethan D Van Vorst,"[3, 3]","I got my little brother Dead Space for his X-Box 360 for Christmas. The game ended up spooking him enough so that he was barely able to get past the 2nd chapter, and so he flew it my way to see what I would make of it. The game took me roughly a week to polish off (between work and sleep) and I found a thoroughly frightening game with beautiful graphics and one of the spookiest atmospheres to be found in any horror/survival shooter game. Beware, a few mild spoilers ahead!Dead Space takes place in the ever far-flung future around a distant planet called Aegis VII on board a derelict mining ship called the Ishimura. It seems that that CEC (Concordance Extraction Corporation), the company which owns and operates that mammoth ship, has lost contact with it. To make matters worse the ship, populated by 1,000 miners, scientists, and ship command types, is transmitting a distress call. So the CEC sends another ship, the CEC Kellion off to Aegis VII to see what's happening. The Ishimura is an interesting vessel, officially titled a ""Planet Cracker"". It cuts away a huge portion of the planetary landscape, pulls it up into orbit, and commences to refining these large chunks of rock into ore. And, predictably, a ship with this capability is going to be, by necessity, a rather large vessel by default.The Kellion carries a small complement of personnel who are there to find out why the ship went silent and are tasked with repairing it. But shortly after arrival the Kellion crashes inside the landing bay of the Ishimura due to a malfunction of the guidance control. Among the personnel on the Kellion is Isaac Clarke, the story's protaganist, and the guy you'll be playing as. Seems Isaac has a girlfriend on the Ishimura named Nicole, and Nicole sent him a strange little video before the ship went offline. Isaac also happens to be an engineer, and he has a real knack for taking existing mining tools and weapons and ""upgrading"" them to make them very palatable for use as weapons. From the time the Kellion crashes in the Ishimura's landing bay you'll know that something has gone horribly awry because the ship seems to be deserted. By the end of the first hour of play you'll wish it *was* deserted and filled with anything *but* the nasties that now inhabit it. By the time Chapter 8 rolled around (there are 12 total) all I wanted was to go home. I did not want to be on this ship at all and the feeling of constant dread that accompanies the game really amps up the fear factor considerably and in turn makes it that much more viscerally enjoyable.Dead Space isn't a FPS but rather a Third-Person Shooter (like Tomb Raider). The view the player has is over Isaac's right shoulder, which is a bit unusual in a game of this type. There are numerous weapons for use by the player, starting with the basic Plasma Cutter (a mining tool) to the Pulse Rifle (a military assault rifle) on up to flamethrowers and a nasty little weapon called the Ripper, which teleports a circular sawblade out about 10 feet where it hovers (and in turn shreds) any mutants that happen to be standing there. All weapons have a secondary fire mode. The Plasma Cutter can swivel 90 degrees allowing you better ""cutting"" angles for severing limbs off of baddies, while the Line Gun can fire off a mine which deals blast damage to any monsters standing in its radius. In addition to this Isaac gets a nifty little item called a Stasis Module, which can dramatically slow down moving objects (including monsters) so that they can be bypassed or taken apart at the player's leisure. Isaac also wears a specialized suit called a RIG, with armor plates and visual aids which let the player know his current health and how much juice he has for his Stasis Module. If all else fails Isaac can use two melee attacks, one in which he stomps his rather large, armored boot on the ground (which destroys little swarming enemies) and one in which he swings a big ol' haymaker at his opponent using his weapon. It's a lot to keep track of, but after the first chapter or two much of it becomes second nature.From the get go Dead Space makes you feel very alone. The Ishimura is a *huge* ship and it is filled with hundreds of nooks and crannies potentially filled with monsters that want to dismember you piece by piece. And the monsters (named Necromorphs) are actually dead members of the original crew. And since there were originally 1,000+ crew this means a whole pile of monsters. Necromorphs come in several varieties. The most common are former humans whose arms have been transformed into stabbing weapons with long spikes where the hands used to be, while others were transformed from infants who like to crawl on walls and shoot long range barbs at you. Others have been absorbed into the ship itself and blast explosive, sentient tentacle beasts in your direction. Early in the story you're separated from your compatriots and have to work entirely alone to repair the ship and bring its basic systems back online, and Necromorphs will drop in to visit at typically the worst possible times. There were moments in the game where I audibly yelped in surprise at my TV screen as a Necromorph dropped from the air vent above me, depositing a bundle of undead nastiness right in front of me. The game is loaded with moments of this type and I found I was unable to play more than 3-4 hours at a time because it was simply too much for my nerves to handle. This isn't helped by the ambient atmosphere, filled with sounds of metal clanging below you, or air vents hissing above. You're constantly looking around to see where the next attack is going to come, even when none does.The graphics for the game are really pretty and the Ishimura reminds me a great deal of the Nostromo from the movie Alien with its ""used future"" look. There's no doubt this is intentional and fans of Alien will probably react with the same degree of paranoia and fear inside the Ishimura. At various points around the ship the player can stock up on supplies from Stores, sort of an electronic vending machine, as well as Power Nodes, which are the critical component used to upgrade weapons and armor for use on the Work Bench. Enemies routinely drop ammunition and money (possibly what their previously living human incarnations were carrying at the time of their...necromorphing). By far the most precious commodity are the Power Nodes, and collecting them becomes a pastime of its own. They don't drop from monsters (except for one or two bosses) and can only be found in power boxes located sporadically throughout the ship, as well as being purchased for hefty sums from the Store. But even the humble Plasma Cutter can be come a customized killing machine if it is upgraded enough (the P.C. became my weapon of choice as a direct result of it).Dead Space also separates itself from the rest of the horror/shooter genre by including two very unique spins on the basic theme. The first is to be found in Zero-G operations. Newtonian physics, monsters, and loaded guns always make for an interesting experience, and the Zero-G segments tend to come across as a puzzle of sorts loaded with adrenaline. The second nuance is that there are numerous spots on the Ishimura where the hull is exposed to open space and requires that you use a finite source of oxygen in your suit. Once the O2 runs out so does your life. One can carry small oxygen canisters around with them, but they take up valuable space and when one isn't sure when these airless episodes are coming one may be disinclined to carry them. Fortunatley the player can upgrade the amount of air their RIG carries by upgrading it at the Work Bench using the aforementioned Power Nodes.Deep Space draws from many sources, but at the end of the day I was amazed at how very close in flavor it was to System Shock 2. In fact one can put the plotlines for both games side by side and say they're almost the same game, just with different names, monsters, and a few added bells and whistles to Dead Space. The plot for both involves a lone player tackling on a crew transformed after death and tackling a biological entity which controls the whole collective. Both plots involve a ship that is slowly turning into a biological organism and which have a device of some sort which instigates the whole problem in the first place (Shodan in SS2, the Marker in Dead Space). Both involve betrayal from trusted friends and sometimes even helping your enemies a bit when your purpose temporarily is in line with their goals. And both contain video and audio logs of deceased crewmembers providing hints on how to beat the Great Opponent, as well as backstory. However to say that Dead Space is a remake of System Shock 2 is a bit unfair to it too because many games have given nods to SS2 (Doom 3, Bioshock, and several others) in very similar ways. Dead Space also takes a healthy heap of atmosphere from movies like Event Horizon, the aforementioned Alien, Aliens, and yes, even a pinch from Night of the Living Dead. Thus I would sum up by saying that Dead Space is really a fusion of the best these games and movies have to offer presented to the player in a very cinematic way. It's literally like starring in your own sci-fi/horror film. And there may just be a moment that comes along and makes you soil yourself, as the title of my review indicates. Fortunately this didn't happen to me (like I'd admit it!) but I will say that when my dog came up behind me and put her cold, wet nose on my ankle at 2am I jumped 3 feet in the air. Now that, my friends, is a game!For the price Dead Space *cannot* be beaten. For a paltry $20 this is a horror/survival game that very much is worth every penny you'll pay for it. If you loved the System Shock series, Bioshock, Doom, Aliens versus Predator (PC games), and the like then you will want this game on your shelf.

I'm an old-schooler that grew up playing the original arcade at a local convenience store down the street - standing around with friends, eating microwave burritos, drinking Squirt, and throwing away my allowance one quarter at a time.  That was a large part of my childhood, a very '80s childhood that I loved every minute of.  From there I bought the Tyson version in junior high and then even after high school - I asked for the Super Punch-Out!! for the SNES Christmas of '94.  And I got it.  There's only one thing missing from this little jaunt down memory lane, the N64 and Gamecube Punch-Outs!! - both systems passed up a great opportunity at making money... namely from me.  I was so disappointed that the series had ended... but then I saw the article and saw King Hippo in all of his glory - jumping right off the page, bigger than ever!  I pre-ordered the first day that Amazon offered the chance.  Seeing King Hippo was plenty enough reason for me.Well needless to say, I've had the game a little over a week now and I've been playing it every night.  So much so that I have finally found a game on the Wii that really connects to my old NES days.  I love seeing fully rendered versions of most of the old characters.  Plus, they've found ways to up the ante for longer play value (records to beat, etc.)  Personally my only complaint is that there are a few characters that are not on here that could've been (I'd be happy to settle for a sequel though).And more importantly, the single thing that stands out about this game is that it seems like a normal game.  Although the game features motion controls and balance board options - it also allows for the classic button style too.  Finally a game that can be a normal old button smasher... if that's your style.  Lately I've found myself starting to tire from all of those fun Wii games that seem to leave my elbows sore and assorted living room objects bumped and knocked over.  Although extremely fun, the fatigue of repetitive Wii remote flicking becomes monotonous.  Wii Punch-Out!! on the other hand lets you revisit the old days of D-pad movement and A / B punching.  I have to say that the Wii, in all of it's innovation, started to lose me to motion sickness.  As to say, I was getting sick of constantly going through the motions of pointing and swinging and whatevering.... just let me play a normal relaxing game already.  I don't want a Richard Simmons workout... I just want to fight King Hippo... without slipping a disc in my back or breaking Aunt Louise's family heirloom vase.Nintendo delivered so much more than that.  This is one of my favorite Nintendo franchises and even with my high expectations, I was not let down (that hardly ever happens).  Thanks Nintendo, I love this game - it makes me feel like a kid again... and not because I broke the vase.",5,"You Had Me at ""Hippo""",1243468800,"05 28, 2009"

I didn't made mistake. The game of the year, GTA III series.Manhunt and GTA share something in common. First of all, they all got horrible graphic. Hard to image that it's the same company who made Max Payne II. Secondly, they are all so-not-detail oriented which I personally believe it's the fundamental attitude to make a good games. This is the attitude that makes Japanese games superior and American games stupider. Probably this is the attitude made Toyota surpassed Ford.Anyway, if you love GTA series, this game is just that style and won't let you down.

Heck, I thought that they were breaking the game, because it would no longer be survival horror, but just another action type game.  RE and Co-Op, in my mind, was a bust.Anyhow, I was finally convinced by a friend to buy it, so we could play together.  I now admit how wrong I was - co-op is freaking awesome.  True, the game is now less about ""surprise"" scares, and more about ""holy s--"" types of scares.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but there is something seriously cool about you and your friend yelling over a mic, ""holy s--, he's freaking after me.  He's after me....s--- run, RUN!""  It gives that additional tension that is only there when you are sharing the experience with someone else.Don't get me wrong, the game does have some glaring faults.  Inventory space is so freaking tiny, that you must (and I stress this), must manage your inventory constantly with your co-op friend, otherwise, you'll be leaving a lot of items behind that you will be aching for later.The controls are now archaic by today's standards.  Controlling your character feels like you are controlling a vehicle, rather than a person; however, once you get used to them, they are serviceable for the most part.  Be warned though, a lot of the times the controls will work against you when you are trying to run away from a pack of zombies, etc.Overall, I give the game a solid 4 to 4.5 stars.  It's fun as hell when played with a close friend, and probably even if you play with a random person online.",4,Great Co-Op game,1241395200,"05 4, 2009"

If you still buy Guitar Hero every year, but don't get Rock Band: this game is for you.It is rushed, rugged and not thought through at all.  The sounds are way off, it looks gritty and has no aesthetic properties whatsoever.  The campaign uses ultra-violence to make up for its lackluster graphics and shock value to blanket the shotty story line.  There is almost nothing new to this series.

The animations are jerky, the dialog is cringe worthy, and the graphics are 1st generation Xbox worthy only. Oh...did I mention the controls? Don't worry, they rarely work right, just add it to the list.I push the left stick forward to move forward and then I remove my thumb and my character will just keep walking until he runs into something...unless he is crouched down and walking with an egg between his knees in which case he'll just keep walking into the wall. How the heck could this not be caught as a huge design flaw by the Q/A testers? Were there even any Q/A Testers for this game?The AI is incredibly stupid but they have excellent vision and can spot you from a mile away at which point you are getting shot from places all over the place and you have no idea where until you look up on the roof 2 buildings over. Or they just start lobbing grenades at you regardless of whether their people are standing right next to you or not.Dialog trees are supposed to give you a dynamic and different story depending on how you play it but no matter how you play it your character always comes off as a smart mouthed idiot. I would say something else but I'll censor myself.If you are used to the excellent way Mass Effect 1 & 2 handle the Dialog and the story and you are loving how fluid and easy Sam Fisher is to control in the new Splinter Cell then stay away from this one... stay far far away...because none of this makes for a fun game....you have been warned.",1,I want my money back...,1276041600,"06 9, 2010"

1896,125375,A14TL53NKPF0TA,B00269QLI8,Mauricio Maroto,"[0, 0]","I picked up this game over a month ago. It was out a long ago (Nov-09), picked it up very late, because I was hooked up with Bad Company 2 and other games. So, I thought give BC2 a rest, and try something different.The single player campaign of MW2 is nice, the graphics are very good and the sound is nice especially if you have a surround system and bass. Also, it has its wow moments with action-packed scenes or tension-immersive events. There are varied locations for each mission. One minor flaw the game has is its the storyline. It's just not properly unfolded nor developed and even it's just not credible. Sometimes, it doesn't make sense at all and you feel playing just to get those achievements. I always consider heavily the campaign of a game and I think MW2 did a good job. There are a few very good missions, and then there are some other ""so-so"".On the other hand, the multiplayer component is very fun, IF you are very good at it. The gameplay is very individually skilled based and very frenetic, and since the killstreaks are very powerful, whoever gets a killstreak first will likely win the round and get the most points. Getting killstreaks (helicopter, harrier, predator, ac130 attacks, etc) in a match is very rewarding, however getting them is very difficult, because you have to kill many opponents consecutively. Overall, it's very different from BC2 online multiplayer, where the latter has a more strategic-squad approach. As of today, I like MW2 very much, maybe BC2 more, considering multiplayer style preferences...Overall, the game is very good, has plenty of replay value especially playing over the internet, has almost none bugs as of now, very good at finding matches online and practically no lag, very quick weapons customization interface, very skilled players are not funny, interesting weapons challenges, the Spec Ops mode (side no-reason-to-be independent clocked missions) is nice but not my cup of tea, too bad the game does not support full destructible environments (buildings).

It had a lot of potential, and got surprisingly good reviews, but it did not live up to the hype.  Don't get me wrong, Sonic/Shadow levels are awesome, and really fun despite being easy.  I would even have to say that Sonic levels by themselves would nab a 5.  The game's major fault, however, is the different levels for different characters.  It would be fine to play with Knuckles or Tails in levels similar to Sonic ones.  They are cool characters.  But instead, Tails (as well as Eggman) are put into inane shooter levels.  They are bearable, but detract from the games essence.  The Knuckles/Rouge levels, on the other hand, are downright horrible, and possess almost no redeeming value (other than you get to be Knuckles, and glide, punch, and climb on things).The storyline is surprisingly good and well thought out, as well as non-cliched, for a simple action game.  Having a Hero and Dark sides of the storyline is really cool, and they help color each other in.  The cut scenes are plentiful and well done, though the English voice acting is terrible (Japanese voices with English subtitles is preferable).  The bosses and boss fights are interesting and added a special flare (at least the ones that weren't other playable characters).  The graphics are nice.  A little outdated, but good enough that it doesn't detract from the game.  Though the camera is bad enough for it to be impossible to see any of the graphics anyway.  On a side note, I think that is exactly how Sonic and Eggman look.  I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about.  The music is amusing at first, but seemingly not very well done (the menu screen music, if left running for ten minutes, is enough to drive one insane).One last thing to mention: Chao World.  It is a nice, adorable, well programmed, fun little diversion, but is ultimately pointless (especially without a working VMU).All in all, Sonic Adventure 2 was cool, but with some infuriating flaws, like non-Sonic/Shadow levels, which pulled it down from 5 to 3 stars.

In this gamers opinion they are right, except that comparison consists mainly of what was WORST about BG.  Gone is the epic story.  Gone is the interesting interactions with NPCs in your party because the whole party is you (many enjoy this, I think it just promits the worst of hack-and-slash while destroying the fun interaction and saving the programers lots of time).What the game most has in comon with BG is the old unfortunate notion of the go fetch adventure that was BG's major shortcoming, to a large extent replaced in BG II.  What do I mean by fetch adeventure?  NPC: I need some wood, can you get it?, NPC: I can't  live without those bones, can you go find them?, NPC: Some toilet paper would really come in handy right now.  I am all out.

I waited forever for this game to finally come to the Wii and now I have to say that it will probably end up being one of many games I have traded in almost immediately to salvage what little return I can get on the game.  Here is why...I feel this is the first Mario Kart that has taken a step back.  From each other release on the three other consoles, there has been improvement.  Game Cube was by far the best in terms of play control and overall fun.  The Wii has taken a step back in time or maybe a step towards making it a game that everyone can play because skill is no longer really allowed in this game.  The driving has taken second seat to the demolition derby that is now Mario Kart.  There isn't a single race that I haven't been blasted by at least three of the following:  POW, blue shell, red shells, ink, and lightning.  The extent of actual driving in Mario Kart shouldn't be called driving, it should be called recovering.  I think the best bet is to get a car with rapid acceleration because you won't be at top speed for long and when you are wiped out, you come to a COMPLETE STOP.  It makes me long for the game cube days where, with enough practice, we could dodge (yes I said dodge) red shells (and if with a little luck thrown in, blue shells) without the aid of dropping something behind you.  Slide turns have been turned in to something completely ridiculous.  It is no longer an expert set of motions on the analog stick that allows for a rapid boost of speed, it is whatever preset skills they have given to the kart your driving and the ability to pass time waiting for you kart to pick up speed.  I also haven't decided if I am a fan of the boost that can be obtained while doing tricks while going off of jumps.  I also play with the Game Cube controller.  I found the play with the Wii wheel to be absolutely horrible.  I will say that it is kind of cool to be able to turn the car like you are actually driving it, but if you want to win the races with any kind of regularity you should probably opt for the old school style of racing.I will say that there are some features of this game that I like.  I do like all of the new courses.  Nintendo has never been at a loss for making up new and interesting courses.  However, when including old courses, am I the only one that thinks they really didn't pick the best of the bunch?  And, why couldn't they have included all of the old courses?I also like that there are more ways to attack your opponents during the race.  It was time that a couple of new things were added.  However, I come back to the fact, that with twelve racers, it is impossible to really race.  And, since most of these things are completely unavoidable, it seems like I am playing to recover most of the time.I am sure that I could go on complaining about how this game isn't all I had hoped for, but I think I will leave with just one more complaint.  Does it make any sense not to drive with a character that isn't huge anymore?  All the karts that the larger characters can drive come with comparable speeds and accelerations to all the little kart drivers but with the added benefit that you can completely drive through all of the little drivers.  It makes no sense to be a small driver anymore.  It's like watching a 500 lb. man wrestle a 50 lb. midget.But, my brother does like playing it.  So, maybe I am the only one that feels this is a step back.  Yet, I don't have the desire to invite all my friends over every weekend for round after round of mario kart where the races were decided by the best drivers and their abilities to use and avoid special items and not by the racer who happens to be lucky enough to recover or avoid or be hit with whatever at the exact right time to go limping across the finish line in front of everyone else.I think the bottom line I have learned from all of the video games I have eagerly anticipated and reserved in advance is this: rent, rent, rent, rent!  Then I will avoid the catastrophes that were assassin's creed, mario kart, two worlds, etc.But I will probably be in the minority here, and maybe we will get lucky and see another (improved) mario kart for the Wii before the next system is released.",3,Demolition Kart,1209427200,"04 29, 2008"

The espionage system will quickly grow uninteresting. I just turn it off at this point. So, here's the main problem. You basically need 99% odds in your favor to win a fight. 50% odds means a 100% chance you will lose. Anything below 80% (allegedly in your favor) means you will likely come out on the short end. Other irritants are things like enemy catapults and cavalry retreating with success nearly 100% of the time. Here's how espionage works: spys come in and blow up a mine. So you go fix it. You can blow up a mine and your opponent will go fix it too. They can poisong your wells or foment unrest. You can do the same. Most of the time spies get caught in the late game and not much gets accomplished by way of secret agents. An espionage standstill develops. It doesn't add much. Corporations do little other than give a small financial boost. You still cannot negotiate for trades with any real frequency, let alone build a strategy around trading. A majority of the time your negotiation screen with any AI civ will show only a column of red text, meaning they are not interested in trading anything. Just go it alone. In conclusion, this is no real improvement upon Warlords. The fighting odds make NO sense.There are points in favor of this game: the new units are interesting; new buildings also add a new layer to gameplay; the new wonders are also abundant and give you a chance to at least grab a few of these key structures if you are struggling. If you are a Civ fan you will buy this game regardless of its flaws. If you are on the fence, just be aware that not all change is good. Sometimes it can just be downright annoying. I've been playing Civ for four years and typically look forward to each new Civ product, but this is a pretty big let down.Update: So, a year or so later i pop BTS back in to play with the new patch. The patch just makes things worse. Now, AI can spawn as many units as it would like. In a war with another civ that had only three cities compared to my dozen or so, i couldn't win because of the spawning. When my units show up to seige a city, there were a few defenders waiting for me. Next turn, the city is suddenly full of defenders. They didn't come from other cities to defend, because i could see all three of the enemy cities and the units therein. This kind of thing just makes the game boring.

Not a standard RPG like a Final Fantasy X, Suikoden, and so on.  Let's get to the review.The story is well told with solid voice acting, and an intersting plot.  You plays as one of two brothers as main characters, switching between their stories before they eventually meet up.  But their very gathering could cause great disaster.  Added to the two brothers are 12 other main playable characters who can take place in battle with you.Battle takes place on detailed hand drawn locations and instead of an old fashioned grid movement system you are alowed total analog freedom of movement (within your characters max walking distance) before you can attack an enemy.  The game rewards you hard earned time with some fantastic full screen magic spells.  Ice meteors, flame swirling everywhere, even a selection of summon beasts.  The characters vary from human swordsmen, archers, and even some cool looking demon people.I think that the games highest praise goes to it's music.  It sounds very proffesionally composed and has a very celtic feel.  Flute and bagpipes along with standard RPG fanfar themes.  Overall, I am really looking foward to this game.

At first it's kind of slow and annoying as you begin quite feeble but after leveling up a bit and finding some nice weapons, things get much more entertaining.  There's a whole slew of side missions giving quite a variety of experiences among players.  The graphics are pretty good too.  Not the best I've seen but still very good.  However, I do have a few quibbles about this game...First off, the vehicles.  Aside from there being about 5 models in the game, the driving mechanics are very poor.  I know this is no racing game, but I feel more effort could have been put into this aspect.  For example, I've noticed at times I couldn't back up and turn at the same time.  It just disregards my input.  Perhaps it's partly hardware limitations (pressing too many keys/certain keys at once) but I really don't think so.Another rather slight problem with the game are the people.  Each person you come in contact with has maybe two lines they say when you are nearby.  Passing the same people multiple times gets quite annoying...  But on the plus side, there is a fair amount of variety in the people you come in contact with.  You will meet many people on the island!But perhaps the biggest deal killer for me is the autosave.  Right now I'm stuck at about 80% in the game.  It wouldn't be so bad but there's no way to backtrack, there's no way to restore previous autosaves, and there was no way to save my game manually.  On top of this, restoring my character after each death has caused my weapons to become more and more damaged and has drained almost all the money I've collected through the game.  Oh...and should I throw something or use some consumable, I wouldn't get it upon restoring the game.So all in all, a good game that easily could have been better.  Perhaps some patches will resolve some issues...  But at this point, if you're planning on getting the game or already have it, I suggest stopping around 75% and just run around.

What I can tell you is that there is a good reason why just starting might end up being the only thing I do in this game.First off the game has some faults to begin with, the graphics are a bit dull if you ask me.  The characters are kind of on the blockish side, they walk around as if they have spoons up their behinds.  This might pass on the PSX but it's not acceptable on a console like the PS2.  The characters and visuals seem pretty stale when compared to the sheer romantic artistry and beauty that goes beyond explanation of Final Fantasy X, but of course what doesn't.  That's why Final Fantasy is Final Fantasy and Xenosaga is... well Xenosaga.The Xenosaga plot seems pretty interesting so far, but again this is an RPG and interesting might not be enough.  When I first started Final Fantasy X, I will admit I wasn't too trilled but then something happened.  I can't pin point the exact moment but it was pretty early in the game when it just grabbed me and never let go. Can't say the same for FFX-2 however.  Moving on, I have a feeling Xenosaga has a super great plot, but unfortunately I may not get to experience it because the gameplay has one huge flaw that I don't think I can handle.I was interested in Xenosage because it was supposed to be an epic RPG.  I play RPG's for the involvement in an epic storyline, I don't play RPG's for gameplay.  I feel sorry for anyone who plays RPG's for the menu selections, if you want gameplay there are better genres out there.  I always scratch my head when people complain about too many cutscenes in an RPG or that the game doesn't have enough exploration.  If you want gameplay and exploration go play something else.  That's the problem with Xenosaga, it's not just an RPG it's also an adventure platformer and not a very good one at that.  The platformer part of Xenosaga is suppose to be the second hand focus of the game and the quality of it shows that, but there seems to be too much of it.  There are too many enemies to be avoided by actually using your skill with the controller.  There are too many keys to find, too many doors to unlock, and all sorts of rooms that will get you lost.  It's not like it's there just incase you want to look around.  Nope, you find out you need to go somewhere but the map doesn't show you where, you have to search for it yourself.  This is just not what I look for in an RPG.  If this doesn't change in Xenosaga soon, I'm afraid I'll have to can it.",2,RPG or adventure platformer?,1052179200,"05 6, 2003"

Attention to historic detail is commendable (nobody's ever perfect here - it's a game, after all).

For example, WE CANNOT USE THE DIRECTIONAL BUTTONS TO CONTROL OUR PLAYERS ANYMORE. I don't know about other people, but I always used the directional buttons to play Madden with great success. Now we are forced to use the left analog stick to control our player, and the right analog stick to break tackles, lean forward, lean away from contact, juke, and high step. We cannot change this to the directional buttons, because, GUESS WHAT, there is a new feature to make offensive/defensive adjustments called the Strategy Pad using the directional buttons. Just to move your defensive linemen, it takes a series of pressing several buttons compared to before. It is also difficult to perform the ""Hit Stick."" I remember back when the Hit Stick was introduced on Madden 2005 and improved defense/Truck Stick on Madden 2006 (as well as QB Vision, but I was never a big fan of that to begin with). Due to the complex controls on Madden 2011, there is no time to perform defensive assignments (press coverage, align defensive linemen/linebackers) before the play clock runs out. On top of that, there is no defense whatsoever, EVEN IF YOU PICK THE BEST PLAY POSSIBLE. It is very difficult to get a pass rush and defend passing plays, no matter what play you pick. It seems like your opponent always has a receiver open. As for running plays, running backs burn you, as well as break tackles easily. If you are defending Adrian Peterson, Chris Johnson, or Ray Rice, you will get burned on the outside, NO MATTER WHAT PLAY YOU PICK.  On top of this, the soundtrack is abysmal-pathetic.Personal Impression:I rarely buy products that I am not happy with because I do intense research before purchasing anything with my hard-earned money. Since I have been a Madden gamer for over 15 years, I did not think twice about purchasing Madden NFL 11.  For the past 15 years, I have made it a tradition to buy Madden every year. Unfortunately, due to personal reasons, I have not played a Madden game since Madden 2008. Do not let that bias your perception of my review because game developers should be trying to attract new gamers, while preserving the current Madden fans who are buying their games.I was so keen on receiving this product in the mail. Unfortunately, I already sold it because it seems impossible to even win a game on here. I used to DEMOLISH Madden Gamers on PS2 online. I had a 100-0 record at one point on the PS2. This Madden game should not be called Madden. It is on the brink of becoming known as a more polished NFL Street.Feedback:We have to learn much more complicated controls for no reason. Madden was great before with just pressing ""triangle, left, right, up, or down"" in order to adjust the defensive backs, as well as pressing ""L1/R1, left, right, up, or down"" to align the defensive linemen and linebackers. Now we have to press one of the directional buttons to bring up the strategy pad, another directional button to choose which defensive assignment to perform, and a final button to perform the assignment. Hello, I know this is a video game, but we only have 5-6 seconds to align before the offense snaps the ball. EA, we are your customers, and you are not letting the gamers have any control over the games we buy. Let us use the directional buttons to control our players, ease the controls, improve the defense, improve the offensive line, and discard the freezing/glitches/lame soundtrack.

To my surprise, there's a ton of gamers still playing this game online, thanks to GameSpy and their endless list of PC servers.The graphics in this game aren't that terrible, however, they use nothing more than basic textures, lighting, and physics. The animations are pretty funny, but I can't really tell if that's intentional. The character models are hilarious, one of them looks like a complete redneck, complete with a lack of chin. The way the characters move will often make you laugh. The animals are pretty decently detailed. You can at least tell where you shot a deer or turkey. The one really neat feature is the bullet-time (ie: Matrix) effect when you get a good kill shot on an animal. Cracking open a skull of a deer with a single rifle bullet is worthy of sitting back to pop you open a cold one. One of the best things is laying deer food, which is textured to look like a human just pooped on the green textures. I think the game would have been a little better if they'd put some grass to hid in or put some more trees. If anything, the worst thing about the graphics is the lack of line of sight. Think Turok with contacts. There's still a nice surrounding of fog.The sounds are horrible, at least in the menu. The looped country guitars get very old fast, but do make you crack a smile the first time you hear it. The gun sounds are decent, mainly the shotgun. Nothing says hunting like a double barrel blasting in the air, and hearing birds scatter. The mixture of some of the sounds don't match well with the animations. Most recognized is the antlers. Knocking them together sounds alright, but it never matches with what the player sees.Probably the worst part of the game is the mechanics. Deer are everywhere so it's not like you really need to wait around. Just spawn somewhere, run around like crazy, and you'll run into something. Does, usually, but still, they make for great target practice. It really ruins the fill. The game has a lot of hunting features such as pee spray and other hunting things, but they're useless since there's just deer spawning like rabbits in this game. One cool thing is the RPG elements in the game. You don't get stats every rank, but you do get to spec your guy with his own gear and his own skills such as tracking or strength.However, with some of the goofyness of the game, the game really holds it's own just because it features multiplayer. There's a lot better hunting games out there, and a lot of games that features better graphics, better animations, better sounds, and tons more animals and realism. Nothing will last as long as Deer Hunter 2005 though since this is the game that at least features multiplayer so you can hunt with friends or see how many servers ban you from shooting your fellow hunters.",3,Fun Online Deer Hunting,1229558400,"12 18, 2008"

10910,119537,ARK5SAGVLW3FY,B001P5HM64,bunnyrabbit4,"[4, 5]","Cursed mountain is a very well illustrated game that conveys the sense of being in an isolated and virtually abandoned Tibetan mountain village that has fallen under some kind of evil curse. I like the use of references to Tibetan culture and hope that more game designers began to work to bring more of these exotic cultures to life. I think the game could have benefited from using more of the rituals, for instance the Tibetan death ceremonies in the storyline and relying less on a ""seek objects and do battle"" format. Just walking around this local is interesting, until you have to do battle with the ghosts who have taken over the town.As good as the Wii can be at some things, I find that combat is not always one of them.These battles involve coordinating several remote actions. Once you have added a spiritual component to your pick axe, (which happens very early in the game) you have to manipulate both the remote and the nunchuk in order to successfully combat the phantoms. The C button on the nunchuk must be depressed so that you can use your third eye and activate your spirit weapon. The B button on the Wii remote is pressed to fire your weapon and the A button must be held down to do rituals which involve moving the remote and/or nunchuk in specific ways to dispel the ghost once it is wounded.This would be great if the Wii remote worked better. Finding the cursor (as you probably know from playing other games),especially with hungry ghosts bearing down, can be as challenging as aiming it. At other times your are able to aim it, but nothing happens in the game. The movements needed to completely dispel the ghosts are complicated and it is very hard to know whether you are doing them wrong or if the remote is just not fully conveying them. I found what works best is a frenzy of heavy shaking in all directions (including a strong wrist snap forward since this is the remote/nunchuk's weakest direction).Seeing during combat is another issue. You are always following your character rather than seeing through their eyes. The + control pad is supposed to change to first person, but it doesn't do much and can not be used with the third eye in battle. The minute the third eye is activated your movement is also curtailed.  When the attacker is close, you often find yourself blocking your own view of combat and looking at your back. Moving to the side makes it very hard to aim your weapon correctly.Perhaps my least favorite thing about the game is that you are forced to submit to the auto-save feature. I hate games that make you replay major sequences over and over. To me that is boring, and very frustrating when you are forced to repeat major battle scenes.As Wii games go, Cursed Mountain is a very good looking game, with excellent graphics and sound. It is reasonably enjoyable even with the flaws. Exploring the exotic locals and learning about Tibetan culture are interesting enough to make this worth playing.",3,"Great Graphics, Interesting Storyline...weak controls",1255824000,"10 18, 2009"

The vehicles, the strategic elements, horseback riding, etc... the play isn't all the great and for this game, I'd actually dread those moments.- The shooting isn't very precise.- The story is subpar, as if it was written by a pre-teen.- The breadth of maps is nice but many are missing depth. Just not a very vast world.MULTIPLAYER- Generally harder to tell the difference between your teammates and the enemy than most other PVP games.- Maps are average. None of them stand out to me as incredibly well-designed.- Audio realism is terrible. Why can't I hear a guy carrying 40 pounds of guns and ammo running up behind me.- There are more idiots here than any other game I can think of. I can only play with headphones.The bottom line is, I expected evolution but all I got was a rehashed game that is simply not all that fun.

However, once I received the game I couldn't help but to be very upset at critics that rated this game low.This game has so many new innovations that it's surprising that the release didn't get pushed back even further. The graphics are so beautiful and take full advantage of the PS3 in every regard. The music soundtrack and storyline are good too.The best part of this game and something that can't be done on any other game system is the real time air battles and ground battles that take place simultaniously. The cell processor is the only hardware that can handle this type of extreme gaming.The controls to the game are very smooth. Once the user gets used to using six axis (It took me about 15 to 20 minutes to stop using the joysticks every now and then lol) the game goes to an entirely new level. The camera is flawless, the cutscenes are great, and the fighting controls are great. The coolest part about airbattle is takedown when you can defeat an enemby dragon in 50 different ways and all are cool and a treat to watch and play through.The boss battles in the game are tough enough to make the player look for strategy and yet they aren't easy to where the user will never die like in the new Zelda game for the Wii (Not to say that is bad, just that it is too easy).The game challenges the player and also forces the player to replay a level in order to get a higher score (bronze, silver, or gold). The game isn't as long as other games, but the gameplay is soooo fun that this is completely made up for. I got about 6 to 8 hours out of the game (about the same as Rainbow Six: Vegas).This is a must buy for all gamers who love the PS3, dragons, old time battles, and strategy, all along with beautiful graphics and flawless design.Don't judge the game just because of a control setting. It was advertised this way and a player shouldn't buy it if they aren't into motion control.

1442,77685,AK0CENM3LUM28,B000K9OP2A,Amazon Customer,"[7, 8]","Heavenly Sword / 711719813224 / B000K9OP2ADisclaimer: This review is written for people who haven't bought / played this game but are considering doing so now that the game is older and slightly cheaper than the newest stuff out there. Thus, this is an ""as is"" review, not an ""as was"" review, hence the ""retrospective"" perspective.""Heavenly Sword"" is a very pretty game, with an interesting setting and intriguing backstory. The story is well-told, through many interesting and lovely cutscenes, and I think it is probably safe to say that this remains one of the most attractive and visually polished games on the PS3, which is doubly impressive considering that this is also one of the earliest titles on the system.Having said that, I do wish a bit more polish had been spent on the game mechanics overall, as graphics and story can only go so far to forgive a clunky play system, particularly in a hack'n'slash adventure game. The control system in regular combat is... adequate. It does feel a little too much like ""smash every button on the control and hope for the best"" and less like finesse and timing is appreciated, but eventually it does start to feel like skill is appreciated (particularly via fatality moves) over stamina. Although when some of the armored baddies show up, it does feel like your fingers are in danger of falling off at times.Most of my frustration, however, comes with the addition of what I would call gimmicky gameplay. Several sections require the use of the Sixaxis controller to guide arrows and cannonballs towards their targets. I, personally, have never been a fan of the Sixaxis, as I feel that the controller is just too sensitive to the slightest movements in some regards (as in, oh, I accidentally moved the control ever-so-slightly off-level, so OF COURSE that means I wanted my cannonball to swing giddily off into the ether), and completely insensitive to certain deliberate movements in other regards (look, I'm tilting left! LEFT! What's wrong with this thing?). I'm not a big fan of movement-sensitive gameplay period, as I tend to have shaky hands, and flat-out requiring it in gameplay to get past a level is kind of frustrating for me. Now, I know that some people love the Sixaxis and if you're one of them, that's great, but if you're like me - well, now you know that at least one level in ""Heavenly Sword"" requires Sixaxis control, and be forewarned.The other facet I don't much care for in ""Heavenly Sword"" is the preponderance of quicktime events. Now, given an infinite number of ""do overs"", I don't mind quicktime events so much at the start of a chapter if it's an adventure interlude - I can play Simon Says with the best of them, so if I really MUST press X-0-L-R-U-D-X-X before I can be let into the chapter, well so be it. But ""Heavenly Sword"" also uses quicktime events as 'finishing moves' for boss battles, and if you fail to get the sequence perfectly correct, the boss gains all his hitpoints back, and that is annoying. Add into the fact that restarting the battle on your part means wading through dozens of red-shirts before you can even GET to the boss, then you beat him down low enough to trigger the quicktime event, and THEN you must get a perfect sequence of buttons or he regenerates all his health for no adequately explained reason, and it's just frustrating.Action/adventure brawlers are not, I admit, for everyone. They're not my usual genre-of-choice, probably because I'm not very good at them, and ""Heavenly Sword"" certainly felt more like 'work' than 'play' for me. Someone more experienced and appreciative of the genre would no doubt feel differently. I did appreciate the stunning graphics and interesting story, but because the story so frequently felt walled off by the Sixaxis and QTE gimmicks, I eventually lost interest in the game despite the story. I would recommend checking out ""Heavenly Sword"" if you know you're already a fan of the genre, but if you're not already an action/adventure fan, ""Heavenly Sword"" probably won't make a convert out of you.~ Ana Mardoll",3,Retrospective: Unpolished,1264550400,"01 27, 2010"

889,133824,A1A89LQ8C1AYV1,B002GJRQQY,Christopher Deweese,"[1, 8]","The Demon's Souls Deluxe Edition is quite an impressive package at first glance.  Not only do you get one of the most highly anticipated PS3 exclusives of the year, but you also get a strategy guide, an artbook, and a soundtrack CD.  The game case is exquisitely done with embossed paper and shining foil.  All of the art work is top notch and beautiful.  Like most of us, word of mouth reached my ears about how wonderful this game was and how great it was that the PS3 finally got its own exclusive, hardcore RPG.  The fact that Atlus only pressed a limited number of copies practically made me panic into ordering the game online.  After having played Demon's Souls I'm here to tell you that it's not THAT great.After getting started on the game, I found that the strategy guide wasn't all that useful.  The walkthrough seems spotty with not a lot of detail.  It had some nice photos and rundowns of weapons and armor, but that's about it.  I think I appreciated the artbook more due to the character descriptions and, well, the art.  I'm not into game soundtracks so much.  Suffice it to say I wasn't impressed with that either.  If it's your cup of tea, that's fine.  The extras that come in the deluxe edition provide some brief novelty, but they didn't really enhance the game that much.The game itself proved underwhelming for me.  The initial character creation process was pretty standard.  It's pretty much the same thing you've seen in Fallout 3 and Dragon Age.  The graphics ended up not being nearly as jaw dropping as I would have liked them to be.  Maybe I'm spoiled on Uncharted 2 and Killzone 2, but since Demon's Souls isn't really what I'd call an open world game, I assumed the developers could have spent a little extra time on the environments and such.  The controls aren't very precise.  I found myself trying to attack an enemy, but I ended up lunging at a wall 90 degrees from where I was standing.  Frustrating.Speaking of frustrating, probably the most popular aspect of this game is its level of difficulty.  Yes, the game is very unforgiving.  I don't mind the fact that my character dies regularly.  What I do mind is that you cannot save your progress.  Rather, after you die you're relegated to the very beginning of the level.  I'm not sure who thought that was a good idea, but they were wrong.  Every other RPG worth its weight allows you to save your progress.  I disagree with a lot of other reviewers that this somehow forces you to play to the best of your ability or that if you can't deal with it then this game is not for you.  I believe that the inability to save your progress creates a situation that simply isn't fun.  It destroys the pacing of an already miniscule story.  I'm not sure if the ability to save my progress would have saved this game for me, but it couldn't have hurt.Unfortunately, I decided to give up on Demon's Souls.  I traded it in at Gamestop for a paultry fifteen dollars of store credit!  Some may think that was a bad move, but I don't regret it for a second.  The thought of having to slog through Demon's Souls for countless hours was more painful than taking a hit on the money I got back.  Keep in mind, I enjoy deep, hardcore RPG's like Fallout 3, Oblivion, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, KOTOR, and the like.  Demon's Souls just doesn't compare in my humble opinion.",3,I Hate To Rain On Everyone's Parade,1261440000,"12 22, 2009"

I've heard a lot of people who are ""rally purists"" complain about this not being a rally game and being too arcade-like.  I like rally just as much as the next guy, but this is a ""game"" and it's supposed to be fun otherwise it's called ""work""...if you want realism, go get a real car and learn how to do it for real.  I play games for fun; not to emulate real life.  That said, I'm a big fan of the old destruction derby games on the PSone...Destruction Derby Raw still being my favorite.  Flatout Ultimate Carnage on PC is also another shining example of the type of driving I like.  Codemasters has really hit my sweet spot with Dirt Showdown.  Some may pass it off as a large DLC for Dirt 3, but that's exactly what I love about it.  It takes all the fun parts of that game (for me anyway) and mashes them into this disc with tons of car carnage.The best part of it for me is you can play it with the Driving Force GT wheel (and others like the G25 and G27, I think) and it feels great.  The physics have been nerfed a bit for a more arcade feel, but it works in the confines of destruction derby just fine.  This isn't a rally game, so it doesn't need to feel ultra-real.  There are a ton of races/events and two ""playgrounds"" in which to collect icons and pull off tricks.  I've only played a handful of races so far, but I can see where it's going and am enjoying it very much.One annoyance is the announcer; he just sounds too corny.  That may be what they were going for, but it gets in the way of the fun for me.  For the last even I played, I turned him down to zero, but for some reason, I could still hear him.  Either I'm doing something wrong, or it needs to be patched.I haven't played online yet only because in general, I don't like people (individually, they can be ok).  I play games to get away from people, so there you go.I'm looking forward to Dirt 4 and Grid 2, but hope CM does a Showdown 2 that's bigger and better than this one.

Assassin's Creed II is one of those rare games, and also represents what a sequel should be.Assassin's Creed II boasts a wonderful enrapturing story that really grabs you both in a politic/historic/science fiction sense. Never have I seen the three mixed so well with an ending that can make your head spin for hours afterward and have you talking amongst your friends about for days. You are not Altair, but Ezio Auditore who is on a path of vengeance for the rival banking family that killed his. In the real world you are still Desmond Miles trying to unlock the secrets of his assassin ancestors, and figure out what the Apple of Eden is really meant to do and why everyone wants it.From the start you will notice major changes from the original and this being graphics. The game is truly one of the most beautiful of the decade capturing the Italian Renoconce era with all of its amazing architecture, historic figures, and language along with the social classes of the time, but before we talk more about beauty let's talk game play.As everyone recalls the first game was very repetitive and pretty bare bones so expect Assassin's Creed II to have tons of things to do. Not only are there more side missions, but there are more scripted story driven missions and playing a Desmond isn't so boring. You actually go to a different location with Desmond and even fight with him...just a hint without spoiling anything. You have your messenger, beat up, and race events from the previous game, but gone are the ""helping citizen"" events. You have tons more variations from raiding assassin tombs (interior Tomb Raider style levels), to Templar Lairs, races on horseback, assassination contracts, finding codex pages to upgrade your health, chasing down people stealing your money, chasing down messengers, solving glyph puzzles, finding statuettes, restoring your uncles villa, more viewpoints and the list goes on. Yeah there is more variety and because there is so much to do, and so many ways to do them you really never get bored because I never did.You can do ten side missions then three main missions then fast travel back to your uncle Mario's villa to upgrade the city to get more income for you to spend, then go find some feathers for your mother in mourning, then maybe get some codex pages.Doesn't sound like enough? That's ok the variations in story missions never get dull with all the weapon upgrades you get. You even get to use Leonardo di Vinci's flying machine about 2/3 of the way through the game.  Want to talk about upgrades? Well there is an economy system in play here, but don't get too excited. It's your simple buy stuff from merchants and upgrade your stuff type thing. You can upgrade your armor over a dozen times, buy dozens of weapons, upgrade medicine pouches, throwing knives, and even poison vials. You can dye your clothes, buy paintings to increase the value of your villa. Did I mention there are every assassin weapon in this game? You have smoke bombs, dual hidden blades/punch daggers, poison blade, hidden gun, and even a passive ability to toss money on the ground to distract guards.Fans of the original remember that the best attack was the running and jumping assassination attack. Wanted more? Well you get more with the ability to pull guys down from hanging on a ledge, from a hiding spot, on a bench, in a crowd, jumping off something, and any way you possibly can. You can now swim which is a huge plus, and blending has totally changed. Instead of having a ""blend"" button the previous ""blend"" button is now a ""walk fast"" button which can be used to pick pocket people for money by just running into them. Blending now consists of using any group of pedestrians or hiring people. You can hire courtesans, thieves, or mercenaries to do your dirty work or distract guards from important posts or patrols. This allows you to walk right on by to wherever you need to be. You can blend by sitting on benches, or dropping your notoriety. Your notoriety is the creed diamond that has a red bar around it. The higher it gets the more the guards will be on your case and chase you for subtler things. Ripping down posters or bribing heralds can bring it down, but becoming anonymous first is a must.Now that we have basic elements out of the way let's talk combat. The core combat system is here, but with upgrades, such as being able to counter a counter attack, take away weapons, use your hidden blade as a weapon for instant counter kills and so on. The enemy AI is also better with four enemy variants that can chase you down or kill you with their bulk and massive weapons.Free running is also slightly improved with tighter controls and better designed levels, more climbing puzzles (viewpoints), and just more terrain overall. The game really only gets frustrating when the controls get a bit sticky and you cling to well to ledges. The world is 3x the size of Assassin's Creed with the towns of Forli/Venice, Firenze, the Villa, and Roma. After about  through the game you get to ride a horse drawn wagon in a chase down a mountainside to get to Forli/Venice which is a rich cinematic experience which the game is full of. Once you get to Venice you can ride gondolas and swim in water.So with all this greatness and beauty that Assassin's Creed II gives us how does this soup taste? With all these ingredients I have to say it tastes damn good. Everything works well together and the game feels like a rich illustrious world that doesn't feel dead. With fluid combat, free running, plenty of stuff to do, amazing visuals, voice acting, history, and science fiction you get anywhere from 15-25 hours of wonderful game. This game will have you sitting back and savoring every moment, but not because of just how amazing it looks and sounds, but how beautiful the game is as a whole.

So there is no point in me writing about it again because you know so here's a review about the game itselfFIFA 14 on the PlayStation 3, was already a fantastic game of footie, and without question, one of the best entries in the franchise to date.So when it arrived on the PlayStation 4, it was tough to imagine what else could be done to the game to improve it even more.  And for the most part, the game doesn't get any major improvements, but the visual polish and enhanced physics do stand out, giving the next-gen version of FIFA 14 some extra points.All the modes that you find on the PS3 are still there, such as the Ultimate Team, career mode, matches from the current week and of course the online modes. For those who had previously picked up a current-gen version of the game, you can pass your season over to the PS4.As expected, the biggest differences from the current-gen and next-gen versions are the graphics.  Players, stadiums and the pitch look extremely sharp and detailed, not to mention more colorful and realistic. Even more minor improvements like how the jerseys and shorts ripple during play, look pretty cool, so without question, this is more of a visual feast.  I also mentioned physics, which is another improvement in the game.  EA built FIFA 14 on next-gen from the ground up with a new engine and you notice it quite a bit with the way the ball moves around the field.  By that I mean that the ball seems to have more randomness to it, so that when you're passing it around, be it as a lob or a through-ball, it appears more independent than I'm used to seeing it.  In relation to that, you'll notice player animations to be less canned and more realistic than ever before, as it's clear that the amount of animations is a lot deeper than in previous games, and players react more naturally not only to the ball, but to other players, regardless if they are on the opposite team or on your own.A.I. also seems more authentic than in the current-gen versions as players on the other team appear to be more aware of what you're doing and react accordingly, so that using the same exact defensive strategy doesn't always work, forcing you to be more tactical and precise with how you play.At the end of the day FIFA 14 on the PS4 and Xbox One doesn't make huge improvements to the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, but they're certainly more appealing to look at and provide a bit more realism to player and ball movement.  It's a nice effort for a game that didn't need a ton of changes, and if this is how good the game can be in an first-year effort on the new consoles, then I can't wait to see what EA can do with another full year.",3,A Review Disregarding The Tournament Mode Exclusion,1387670400,"12 22, 2013"

This game is not for you. It even tells you that YOU WILL DIE. And you will.Story: Dark Souls doesn't really have a story, that is left up to you. The basics are that when the world was formed, dragons ruled. Humans eventually were born, found 'The Flame' and rose up against the dragons. They were successful, but at a price. The flames that supported them soon began to die and humans began becoming creatures that are simply called 'Hollow', mindless husks of their former self. You, like all undead (those who are not Human nor Hollow), are imprisoned as to try and stop the spread of the Darksign and set out on a pilgrimage to relight the flame.Graphics: The graphics in Dark Souls are dark, depressing and dank. Which is good for this game as it gives you the feeling of dread and despair, which fits perfectly with this world. Textures look well done and special effects are rare, but done well. Foliage is done very well also, and you'll spend a fair amount of time in it.Controls: Controls are rather basic, you get a few slots for spells, while other buttons will have you attack, roll, defend, etc. If you've played any sort of action adventure RPG game, you'll feel comfortable with the controls.Voice/Music/Sound: There isn't much with voicing here, a few NPCs will talk when talked to, but they aren't frequent. Music and Sound however, are commonplace and are pleasing. Music can range from a low background sound to dramatic when facing bosses, but most of the time you'll be able to play without suffering from overbearing music. Sounds, such as walking, running, water, etc are also done to the same quality.Other: There is a small amount of online play in Dark Souls as well. This comes in two forms, the co-op and versus. Co-op is playable after obtaining a certain item and allows other players to summon you into their world (or them into yours if you are human), this allows for more than one person to fight bosses. HOWEVER, if you've already beaten an areas boss, you cannot summon in that area.Versus varies, normally, anyone who is a human can be invaded by another player, the two fight until one dies. Joining certain alliances will give you the ability to fight others who attempt to harm that alliances key members or protect an alliances territory. This is only possible though if you are in human form.Overall: Dark Souls is a very tough, yet very rewarding game for those who have the skill to conquer it. Memorable characters and gameplay have earned it many awards and a sequel in the making.Pros:- Tough and rewarding- Unique gameplay- Worth the frustrationCons:- Tough (but rewarding)- Weak online- Sometimes feels TOO distant, deserted",5,One of the Better Games of 2011,1360886400,"02 15, 2013"

However, for whatever reason, I let my curiousity get the best of me this time.  I ignored the scathing reviews and actually let the one or two decent reviews talk me into buying this farce of a game.  How diasppointed was I?  Well, I spent $3.99 + shipping, so about $7.00 total.  That's a complete meal at Taco Bell.  I'd have gotten 1,000 times more enjoyment out of some Taco Bell tacos than I did with this piece of crap.

If this game has any redeeming quality whatsoever, it's that it looks good.  The graphics are clean and well done.  The good points end there.  Regardless of how good it looks, you can't enjoy it because you'll be too frustrated trying to control the idiot protagonist.  I read a review on this game that described the controls as being similar to a tank with a broken engine.  That is spot on.  Just trying to move the jerk so you can focus on a specific point is like pulling teeth.  Trying to actually platform is even more of a joke.  Sometimes, the B button will be jump.  Other times it will be drop down.  I guess it's whatever the game decides at any given time.  And combat?  YIKES.  You ""focus"" on an enemy and ""swing"" the right stick to hit enemies with whatever object you can find.  After 50 or so shots to the head with a chair, the enemy will drop...for a few seconds...and get right back up unless you drag the limp body over some fire to fully kill it.  Sound stupid?  It is.  Very.  The sound of the game is also lame.  The voice acting is hilariously bad.  Like something out of a C movie.  Not a B movie, a C movie.So let's see...it controls like crap, sounds like crap, has a convoluted story that I never got into because the game is so crappy that I couldn't bare to continue past the first 45 minutes, and well, it's just crap.  To anyone that claims to have played all the way through this game and considers it a ""hidden gem"" is EASILY entertained, has an unnatural patience level and has likely never played a truly decent game.  Otherwise, I can really think of no reason anyone would derive any type of pleasure from this title.  The developers of this game should be embarrassed to have been a part of this POS.  I'm actually embarrassed to have it on my shelf.  I tried to give it to my neighbor - for free - and I got a response of, ""No thanks, dude.""  He must've read the reviews that I ignored.This game is easily in the top 5 worst games I've ever played in my life, and that's after only playing 45 minutes of it.

I already have Forza 2 and have been using the standard wireless controller with it. I tried out the Wireless Speed Wheel with Forza 2 first since I was most familiar with that game and could compare to my previous experience with the standard wireless controller.  The wheel is pretty accurate and the long throw of the triggers for acceleration and break/reverse are excellent.  After about 15 minutes I had gotten used to it and already prefer it to the standard wireless controller. I then tried it on Forza 4 and it worked great on that as well.  To be quite honest, the controller was better than I expected and for driving (and hopefully flying) games, it is ideal for someone who doesn't want a huge driving setup (and most casual gamers do NOT want an elaborate setup for a couple of racing games).  As already stated, the fatal flaw of the controller is it does not contain the left and right shoulder buttons which many games require.  I'd have gladly substituted shoulder buttons for the illuminated rings on the top of the controller.  99% of the time I'm watching the screen and never look at the controller so the lighted feedback is wasted.  Navigating and doing some tasks were impossible without them and I'm simply amazed that Microsoft left them off.  I give the controller 4 or 5 stars for the actual accuracy (and fun) of the controller but I give Microsoft 1 star because they left two buttons off that a lot of racing games require.  If you can live without the shoulder buttons, this is a must have for racing games.Quick Edit: I picked up Midnight Club: Los Angeles and the wheel works MUCH better than the standard controller. Midnight Club recognizes you are using a driving wheel and lets you customize what every button is used for.If only Microsoft had included the bumper buttons...  :(Here's my Forza 4 advanced wheel settings: Steering Axis Inside deadzone: 3.

4811,199041,A1TR1KNR3VKPHY,B0073ESZ58,OkinawanMatt,"[1, 1]","Having this grip slightly improves my gaming experience with the PS Vita, as my large hands get cramped within 10 minutes of playing any game.  While I was initially worried with the design since the Vita was only being held in place by a millimeter's worth of plastic at the top and bottom, my mind was at ease after a month's worth of use without the Vita falling out, even when I swung it by the handle while walking around.  However, there is one glaring issue for adult hands: The handle is too narrow, with very little to fill your palm while gripping it.  Let me paint you a picture: When you hold an Xbox 360 controller, your fingers naturally curl around each side of the controller, allowing you to rest your fifth and fourth finger on the back of the controller, with the rest of the handles filling your palm.  Now imagine if you took 1/2 of the volume of the plastic out of each handle to make this PS Vita grip and the open grips are too far down and you cannot reach the bumper buttons.  So you have to move your hand up, and now your fingers are pushing against the back touch pad of the Vita.  There's no winning in this situation:  You either have to grip the back of the vita or grip the bottom of the handles and not be able to reach the bumpers.  The only reason this grip adds comfort is that it provides just a bit more plastic to fill in your palms and give you something to hold on to.  On games that don't require the bumper, it feels just a bit better.

Go take a look, exact same name minus the ""6"", same company, comes in the exact same box, etc.  This is the new SKU, I guess.  I have not bought this new ""version"", so my comments apply to the product located at the link above, not this one.  Maybe this is different,  maybe not... you be the judge on that one.  Let me instead tell you of my previous experience.I bought the Shadow Controller because of the ergonomics and I am not a huge fan of the Dual-Shock design.  I wanted something more like the 360 controller.  I read the first 3 or 4 reviews for the controller and they were all glowing with praise.  So I paid up, got the controller, loved the feel, tested it out... and it was junk.  The analog controls were unresponsive unless pressed almost all the way to the end, and the top left corner of the left analog stick would reset back to 0.  Of course this made playing games with the Shadow Controller clumsy at best, impossible at worst.I wrote an honest review of my experience and received this as a comment to my review, ""Please call dreamGEAR customer service department to help with this matter. 1-877-777-3732."" by a name that appeared to be from a company representative of dreamGEAR.I called the number and spoke to someone about the problems I was having with the controller.  They immediately understood what I was talking about without having to give much details.  My impression was they were aware of the problems and of the bad reviews that were starting to roll in.  The representative told me to give some personal information to them, including my home phone number, and a manager would call me back within a few hours, telling me what they decided to do to fix my problem.Well, I guess they decided they were not going to return my phone call as a solution, because there were no phone rings, no caller ID, and no messages left on my phone.Could I have followed-up?  Sure, but why bother?  Consumers generally don't like having to aggressively pursue a remedy to a faulty third party console peripheral.  I simply chalked that one up to 'buyer beware' and took the loss.Other bad reviews started rolling in on that product page.  Analog sticks not working, bad customer service, performance disappointing.  It started to look like those initial few glowing reviews were way off mark.  And then, lo and behold, here is a new product with a new SKU called the ""Shadow 6 Wireless Controller"".  Same company, same look, same box, same colors, etc...  And a few initial glowing reviews, some even claiming the specific problems with the other ""version"" have been fixed.Well, dreamGEAR?

11467,105845,A3Q6GL7WQJG5XF,B00175GC4U,Tushster,"[0, 1]","Before I begin my review, I never played Smackdown VS Raw until the 2007 release. I then followed up with 2008 and now 2009. From what I've read, the ones before 2007 are the better ones, but I'll be writing my review based on the ones I've played personally.I'd like to start off by saying I'm quite disappointed in THQ. It seems players who've played SVR07 and SVR08 have submitted feedback about what they'd like to see changed in future releases, but THQ didn't incorporate much from what the customers suggested into 09.Gameplay feels exactly the same as it did in SVR08. I don't think I've noticed anything different about it. The moves are pretty much the same, all the hotspots are the same, with no new hotspots added. In fact, they removed a few now that you can no longer take the fight into the crowd. During the bout, player animations are exactly the same as in SVR08. When I put the disc into my Xbox 360 and launched the game for the first time, my first reaction was ""I've totally played this game before.""THQ did focus on tag-teams in this game, which is pretty fun if you're playing with a friend. If you're playing with CPU, expect them to be as stupid (or even worse) than they were in the previous games. If you're playing in a normal tag, the person standing at the ropes isn't completely useless. The person controlling that superstar can move him/her around the ring, grab the legal opponent in the ring, distract the referee, and perform a blind-tag with the legal partner. They also added the feature of a ""hot-tag."" If your friend is getting manhandled around the ring, and you want in to rescue him (legally), you can pump up the crowd, and your partner can perform a hot-tag with you. What this does is when you get tagged in, you quickly press a button combination (you'll see prompts on your screen). If done correctly, you'll knock down the legal opponent, as well as their partner on the ropes, and you'll gain full momentum allowing you to perform a finisher on your opponent. This is cool because since you also knocked down their partner, you can likely go for the pin because they'll still be on the ground outside the ring. As I mentioned, it's only fun with a friend. If you're trying to do a hot-tag with CPU, they will probably not do the hot tag, but just tag you in normally. Unfortunately, a hot tag can only be performed once per team in a tag match, so basically use it at the right time and make sure you follow the prompts, because if you don't do it right, your momentum will completely diminish.The entrances seem to look a little better in this release. The lighting and character textures look far more realistic. The crowd has also been slightly improved. The best thing is, most of the crowd is new. They didn't reuse audience members like they did from SVR07 to SVR08.Another feature of this game I like is ""Road To Wrestlemania."" There are (unfortunately) only few pre-selected superstars who you can pick from, and complete a short-but-sweet storyline with, and take them to Wrestlemania. The storylines are (in my opinion) a little entertaining, and quite cheesy (just like they are in the actual WWE) but that's the fun of it. During the process of finishing their stories, you have opportunities at bonuses, and when you complete that certain task, you will unlock something new to be used during exhibition gameplay. Like I mentioned, the characters are pre-selected, and I was a little disappointed at the selection. I think they could've picked better superstars to complete this mode with. This is definitely a HUGE improvement from General Manager Mode from the previous installments. Those, I just found way to frustrating and long!They also have a feature called ""Career Mode."" Here, you can basically ""train"" a created superstar and help him/her obtain abilities. You follow certain paths, earn the titles and get points based on how you do in your matches. For example, if you start a match, grab a chair and start hammering away on your opponent, your Hardcore points will skyrocket. It's a neat feature, but it quickly got boring for me. If you notice, I also said ""her"" earlier. That's right. You can train a created Diva in Career Mode. She will first start by going after the Women's Championship. Once she earns that, she can contend for the other championships as well. Unfortunately, Divas can't be used in any other match types, other than the ones they could already participate in (single, tag, battle royal).THQ also incorporated a new feature called Create-A-Finisher mode. Here, you can (hence the name) create your own finisher and assign it to any character. At first, I thought this would be pretty awesome. But when I tried it out, I was greatly disappointed. You can assign up to 10 mini-moves to complete your finisher. However, the more mini-moves you assign, the far limited the list of available remaining moves becomes. So if you're looking into creating a deadly 10-move finisher, chances are, you won't be able to create what you're thinking of.The character selection in this game is far better than it was in the previous games. There are plenty of superstars to pick from. I was really happy they finally decided to add Brian Kendrick and Paul London, after many fans were disappointed they were left out of last year's release.There's this feature called Highlight Reel Editor, or something like that. I thought this would be pretty cool too. I was expecting maybe you can create a mash-up of different replays during your matches and customize an entrance video for your superstar. But nope, not even close. You can just upload your replays to Xbox Live for fans from around the world to see how you manhandle your opponents. Nothing too exciting there.A couple new things THQ also added: the infamous Inferno Match as well as the Tribute To The Troops arena. It's an outdoor arena, and everyone in the crowd is a soldier.One thing I really hope for is Downloadable Content. I don't care if it's a roster update, more costumes, or even match-types. I just hope they allow players to gain access to more things that weren't included in the original release.Overall, this game (aside from the new things THQ added) is the same as SVR08. The new additions aren't that exciting; they could've done a lot better with the new features. The only reason I bought it was because I'm a huge wrestling fan, and my collection would be incomplete without it. If you're sitting on the fence debating whether you want to buy it or not, I can either recommend renting it first, and see whether you like it, or wait until the price drops. I honestly don't think I should've paid the full retail price for this game.Let's wait and see how SVR 2010 will be...",3,Same As 08 Except With A Few Additions,1229385600,"12 16, 2008"

Many months ago, I was just another nay saver, posting negative comments about the series shifting in the wrong direction. It's definitely fair now to retract my previous statement, as I always seem to do with this series (Refer to my review on Pro Street). They did a wonderful job transforming an arcade series into a full pledged simulated racer.I've played every single racer that has been released on the next-gen consoles, and I can't even count how many dating back to last generation. In my honest opinion, Need for Speed Shift's new cockpit view is hands-down the most exhilarating and realistic experience that you would have behind the wheels of a car. From the shaking of the car, the heavy breathing of you as the driver, and best of all the disorientation that is experienced when slamming into a wall over 100 mph.  The graphics are also the best in the series, with a great polish over vivid colors, plush textures and practically no frame rate issues. I gave shift 4 stars for entertainment value because it simply is very entertaining. However I gave it 3 stars in over all because of some minor set backs that don't entirely bring the games value down, but don't help very much in the over all dept.My grips with the game come in random fashions: 1. Instant relay is somewhat lack-luster, with poor camera movement and excitement, though kind in mind the series has really never had replays, except for Underground 2. 2. Customizations have dumb down too much, this coming from a series that invented the ""auto-sculpt"" in Carbon. 3. Lack of visualization in the menus, before the series offered a ""photo mode"", to get an overview of the car, but that has been taken away by far.So all in all, this is a solid title with plenty of replay value for the time being. Now sure how shift will hold up once Forza 3 and GT 5 are released, but it definitely fills the void for the time being. This game falls somewhere in-between the hardcore simulation and the casual arcade racers. If you are open-minded and prefer to play both types of racers, the Shift is worth your time. However, if you a junkie for tuning cars and customization of engine parts, then this game may not be for you... just remember to have fun with this game, that's what it was created for!",3,Need for Seriousness,1254441600,"10 2, 2009"

This game was created with the sole purpose of selling you more credits so that you can buy all of those 1200 cars. The microtransaction system sucked the joy out of winning prize cars and collecting credits for buying all of those realistic cars. Don't be fooled by the headline features such as 1200 cars or a record number of tracks. Taken in isolation, this is an ""ok"" racing simulator. But if you're a fan of the GT series, you will be tremendously disappointed. Having enjoyed playing GT5 in all modes for 3 years, here's my take:Pros:------ Improved physics, cars sway off axis correctly, wheels bounce on bumps, every cars suspension is different. You can't be taking tight corners going 80 in an old charger without oversteering and fishtailing, as it should be.- Many interiors have been revamped, cars look great inside, although the non-premium models still look shoddy.- Menus are much cleaner and faster. Switching cars and applying performance upgrades, navigating between menus is faster by an order of magnitude.- The lunar mission's kinda cool.Cons:------ The microtransactions completely ruin the experience. There are roughly 90% fewer prize cars. Race rewards have been cut down tremendously. All designed to make you dish out for that car you wanted. Shame on you Polyphany! Way to become EA.- There's no more Used\Online Dealerships, letting you find random cars at a bargain.- No more 3D. GT5 looked great in 3D, why would you remove such an awesome feature?- No B-spec. Again, very innovative game mode yanked out.- Maybe it's just me, but each course feel slightly less real and more cartoony around the shadows.- Most cars are outdated. We're in model year 2014, but according to Polyphany it's still 2010.- There are only 4 online challenges.If you haven't played GT5 yet, buy the fully featured GT5 XL for $20. That's the game for which the Gran Turismo series will forever be known.Update 12/20/13----------------With the 1.02 update, Polyphany clearly responded to an outcry about the diminished payments. There are some new seasonal events that pay out hundreds of thousands, not single digit thousands. Consecutive days login bonuses have also been resuscitated from GT5, which reward loyal players with up to 2x the normal credits. These are all very welcome changes.With that said, you can't collect repeat rewards for the same seasonal events like you used to, and the game still severely lacks prize cars. Yes, of course you can play for 5,000 hours and collect all of the cars. But realistically, if Polyphany went through the trouble of creating all 1,200 cars, shouldn't they make them more accessible to the gamers?Let's hope this is one of many moves by the game creators to balance the game's fun and realism aspects without reaching into the loyal fans' pockets.",3,Microtransactions sucked the joy out of GT6 - Updated,1386806400,"12 12, 2013"

From there you get to recruit bigger and better players and there is, as always, a multitude of nice extras and side-quests that. in theory, add colour and excitement to the game.First, the good points. The graphics are astounding, with large, beautifully-detailed characters and bad guys maintaining a very impressive frame-rate on-screen. Music is fairly standard FF fare, stirring battle tunes and o-so-sweet ballady tracks adding much atmosphere to the proceedings. The voice acting has been unfairly criticised, it's good, and a hugely welcome change from endless reams of text to wade through. It's also easier to remember plot points when you hear them, and there's no danger of skipping over them with a Cancel button. However, this is customisable, and you can have the audio with or without subtitles.The plot, on paper, is one of the best FF plots around - detailed and complex, without being confusing, it's the stuff of solid games legends.Unfortunately, though, none of these points can save FF X from the in-game mechanics, and this is where FF X fails badly. The shrines and cityscapes of FF X are beautifuly detailed and bear exploring, and the fact that one can learn the language of Al Bhed are excellent points, both worthy of exploring at one's leisure. However, thanks to the hugely restrictive game-on-rails nature of FF X, it's oftentimes impossible to go where you want to go, or to prepare for the bigger battles. This affects the storyline, too, as major events for the first part of the game are few and far between, and so fighting beasties to build up your levels becomes such a chore.Plodding along, you very quickly get a sense of not having much to do with the game itself, that you're just there to watch events unfold and press the X button intermittently. And for some gamers, that's fine, but aftermagnificent titles like FF VII and FF IX, it's not really good enough for a FF sequel. Also, Blitzball is possibly one of the most over-complicated side quests ever, really worthy of being a game in itself.A disappointment that could so very easily have been an unequivocal classic, FF X is really a rent-before-you-buy title.",2,Not the best by a long shot.,1078531200,"03 6, 2004"

6296,164044,AVHOYRYLOYAMR,B003X1BURA,epicpaige,"[1, 1]","I'm an avid player of the Nancy Drew games series.  I downloaded this game on my Mac after beating Crystal Skull on my PC, which had been the most recent title I'd owned.  I loved the new interface on this game, and have been stocking up on all the new games since.I did, however, find this game to be a little too simple.  After how challenging the earlier games had been (such as Stay Tuned for Danger or Blackmoor Manor), I was expecting to be playing this game for more than just a few hours.  I sat down and knocked the whole thing out in a a single sitting without cheats or any periods of time where I was stumped!  It was a nice reintroduction to the series that I hadn't touched in a year or so, but the desire to replay this game is gone.  Unlike the other games where I still have a challenge even after beating the game, this game is a total yawn to play over.That being said, the graphics were nice and the puzzles were fun.  I thought the periodic table puzzle was charming and an interesting twist on what is normal for Nancy Drew puzzles.  The settings weren't too confusing, and even though some of the exploration was lacking, there was still plenty to see in the highschool and being able to explore Maxine's Diner was unexpected.The characters weren't the best, in my opinion.  I usually find a character or two that I really like in each game, but this one was an exception.  Within the first meeting of each character, I found them unlikable.  They were all dark people, who only became worse with time.  I will admit that all of the secrets each character had made it so that at first, the culprit was hard to determine.By the time the game was about half-over, I knew who the culprit was.  Any seasoned Nancy Drew player would have been able to guess after playing for a while.  A very traditional ""least expected suspect"" kind of thing.  I did, however, find the motives to be a nice twist.I am an 18-year-old player, and found that the game was not scary at all (I have always found The Final Scene and Blackmoor Manor to be 'lights on' kind of titles and yelped a few times while playing Shadow at the Water's Edge).  I found the final scene a bit unnerving being held at gunpoint.  I wouldn't recommend this installment of the series to younger girls because of that scene.  That and the themes of murder and drug use are a little mature.  Some people have said the drug references are subtle but I found them blatantly obvious.  In fact, I was surprised at how much HER Interactive put inside one of the magazines in the student library.It's unfortunate that the easiest game released isn't a good game for young players due to the more mature themes.For as many gripes as I have, I did enjoy the game a lot, and recommend it to any older fan of the series.

(still, the smoke is simply amazing).one more negative - artillery.  artillery is a feature where when you reach a certain rank, you point with your binoculars and planes drop huge bombs on the enemy.  for the most part it's cool, except there's simply too much artillery and when one team uses it on the other team's spawn point, the game is virtually over, because you can't stop from being killed by it.  this is a stupid oversight on the part of the makers of UO.other positives - new types of games, especially capture the flag, my personal favorite, greatly add to the fun, instead of playing old boring team deathmatch.  also, make sure you turn your search filter on to search for ""mods"" so you can play new modifications and maps that people created.  this adds to the freshness and excitement of the game.  also turn ""auto-downloads"" on so you can download these new maps when you click on the server.despite the negatives, i still play this game almost every day.  even though i've played it for countless hours, it's still sooo fun.  i think this qualifies as the best video game created to date.",5,best game ever made,1126915200,"09 17, 2005"

5372,144899,A2Z1A6QX2HLKIO,B002MZZLNM,D. Weber,"[7, 7]","I decided to buy this mic because I was curious as to how well it worked.  With what seems to be mixed reviews online, I thought I'd find out for myself.  I'll break down the good and bad points so it's very easy to see exactly where this mic shines, and where it doesn't.The Good:Cool design - it really is fun to wear this mic because not only is it cooler than having a big over the ear mic on your head, but it is rather comfortable to wear.  I can't however say that you don't notice it, because you certainly do, and I could see it being annoying for some people to wear, but it isn't for me.Great earpiece - the audio coming through the earpiece is LOUD and clear.  I say LOUD because when I first used it, I had to turn the volume down about halfway because my ear almost exploded.  The earpiece would be described as ""one size fits most"" but if you are like me and own a pair of earbuds with interchangeable rubber earpieces, you might be able to swap the stock earpiece for one of those.Build Quality - the build quality is surprisingly well done.  I'm not sure if I got a newer version of the mic or what, but I don't see how anyone can claim that the headphone jack doesn't ""snap"" into your controller, because it does for me.  I have not once had a problem with the jack falling out of the slot, but I guess if you threw your controller or something, it might come out then.  You can even use this with most cell phones.The Bad:Poor to Average Voice Quality - This is the only reason why I wouldn't give this mic a 5 star rating.  While using this mic, I notice how much background noise it picks up.  If you are like me and use surround sound, or just have your TV turned on loud, the mic will pick up a large amount of background noise.  I especially notice that my mic indicator is on my screen while I'm blinded by flashbangs, while shooting my gun, or when explosions are nearby.  If you have ever heard a cheaper bluetooth mic, then you should get a good idea of what this mic sounds like.  Because of the way it is designed, the mic basically picks up everything in the room, instead of just your voice.The voice quality really is the only negative aspect of this mic, and it is really unfortunate because it could be a must own piece of equipment if this wasn't such an issue.  It doesn't  bother me, but I know what it's like to be playing with someone who has a noisy mic, and its very, very annoying.Just to comment on other opinions I have read :When you get the mic, it is muted by default, so make sure you flip the mute switch before you use it, or no one will be able to hear it.  It can also be confusing because the switch actually says ""off"" or ""on"" and in order to unmute the mic, you have to turn it to ""off"", which at first made me think the mic would be ""off"".  But this is not a big deal at all once you actually realize it.I've heard that the mute switch is hard to find, but it really isn't unless you are in a dark room.  I think you could easily remember where it is, unless you have problems with things such as, remembering where buttons on your remote control or cell phone are...I haven't had any problems with static, other than other people being able to hear ""static"" from background noise that this mic picks up.I've also noticed that if I wear the piece that goes around your neck, when I wear it higher on my neck, my voice is very muffled sounding, and all my words seem to blend into one another.  When wearing the mic at the base of my neck, it seems like it makes a dramatic difference in my voice quality.Overall, I'd say that this mic is a decent alternative to the standard Xbox mic, but I don't know if I will really use it a whole lot because I just hate the fact that it picks up so much bg noise, and I know my teammates will want to punch me in the face for it.",3,"Not bad, but not good either.",1259798400,"12 3, 2009"

I don't have GH2, so I can't compare, but from what I've played of GH1, it rocked my socks off. I love it! It's great fun and will have you addicted very quickly. The design and look of the game is great, there are fun and great details about it that make you feel like you're a rocker on tour or wannabe rocker. Very fun. Yes, I've heard the guitar isn't the greatest to hold, but it really does work.There are very, very few songs that I actually knew, but when you play in 'career mode' which is the meat of the game and where you earn points and money you're forced to play songs you've never heard of---and most of them are really good, great even. Very memorable. There are several that I really enjoyed and remembered after I finished playing. ""Infected"" comes to mind.I think the difficulty meter could have been a bit easier. On easy you use 3 buttons, on medium you jump to 4 and on hard and expert you use all 5, but I think on medium you should still be on 3 buttons and go to 4 on hard and 5 on expert, even so, I did manage to get through songs using 4 buttons with much repetition.The one gripe and why I took a star away is that you really don't have a great practice mode. Basically, playing on easy is your practice but you don't really get to practice using 4 or 5 buttons until you're in a song playing and that's just too hard in the middle of a song to start to master using all five buttons. That's crazy. There should be a mode where you don't get scored and can just play songs and no matter how bad you are you don't get booed or have to start over. I found it incredibly frustrating to have to practice while in the middle of a set with 4 buttons, I played one song over 30 times just to finish, and while this game is incredibly fun that took some fun away. And the crowd and the game are not nearly as forgiving as they are on easy.However, it is still too addictive and I found myself playing regardless of how many times it took me to finish a song, which is bad on my fingers and wrist. A break is definelty reccomended, I also found it somewhat easier to play sitting down at some points in the game.Overall, this game totally rocks and people are not lying when they say this is the MOST.FUN.EVER. It really is, and I think any complaints are overshadowed by the good stuff, really, any gripes you have aren't so bad that you'd never want to play. There are a few songs that you'll never want to play again, and some you just love playing, and even some songs you've never heard of it that you will like, The song list is crucial.  I GH1 does a good job of creating a decent list of songs.I think the $69 or $79 price tag is worth it, you really will get your money worth, but don't pay more than that. ;)The Gods of Rock, we salute you!",4,It's time to rock and roll people!,1166572800,"12 20, 2006"

Well, my doubts went out the window after just an hour with this masterpiece of a game by Activision.  Sky Odyssey is a flight simulation game just like Pilotwings 64 but done much better.  It gives you many modes of play at first, such as target practice and landing pads.  But the true fun and challenge is in the adventure mode.  You are taken to a series of islands and told to complete certain missions like refuel your plane in midair or fly quickly through a small cave while avoiding falling rocks and wavy waters.  Before each mission you are given a specific tutorial so you know exactly what to do and how to do it.  But believe me, even with the tutorials these missions are very challenging and quite hard to complete under your given time limit.  If you should finish your mission, you are then given a grade and depending what grade you get, you then get to choose one of many upgrades for your plane which will help you later on.  It is really quite a innovative and cool system.  And dont worry about replay value because there are plenty of missions the game has to offer.The different planes in this game are each very unique and neatly designed.  As mentioned before they are all upgradable in areas such as their wing, engine, propeller, landing gear and more.  And for you aspiring artists out there, the game even has a drawing program where you can draw your own symbol on the back of your plane!!The target practice and landing pad parts of the game should be used by beginners as they are good places to practice all of the flying skills with all of the planes.  The control of these planes takes some getting used to and is best when you have an analog playstation controller.  Once mastered, you wont be able to wait for your next chance to become a virtual pilot.My only problem with this game is the graphics.  The weather effects are excellent and utilize the PS2's power very well, but on the training lessons and some parts of the main gameplay the graphics can get pretty bland and boring.  A touch could've been made here and there to better enhance the whole flying experience.  This is the only reason I didn't give the game a perfect score.  But as long as a game has solid gameplay it usually hardly detracts from the whole experience.All in all I'd have to say this is one of the most original, challenging, and fun games I've played in a long time.  If you have some extra cash and are lucky enough to own a Playstation 2, I would highly recommend this game.  Unless you really don't like flight simulators, there is something in here for everyone.

This is such a case.  But I finally finished it.  Though I enjoyed ""Vice City"" tremendously, I won't be playing the next installment of ""Grand Theft Auto.""  Here's why.Have you ever noticed that, in the words of Margo Timmins, ""living's mostly wasting time""?  Well, I have.  A very small percentage of your time actually goes to doing THE THING.  Most of the time you're simply getting ready to do THE THING.  You're standing in line for THE THING, registering for THE THING, arranging payments for THE THING, stuck in traffic trying to get to the THE THING, struggling to get THE THING working on your computer, etc.Well, video games have reached such a level of graphic realism that when you're, say, driving a car down the street in ""Grand Theft Auto:  San Andreas,"" it really looks like you're driving a car down the street!  It even feels and sounds like a car!  Same with the bicycle, the truck, the motorcycle, etc.The problem with this game is that DRIVING A CAR THROUGH TRAFFIC IS BORING!  So is walking down the street!I don't know how much time I spent in this game simply covering distance.  At first I didn't mind it, but after hours and hours spent this way (the video game is far and away the longest I've ever played -- really epic), you find yourself putting your iPod on to stave off the boredom.  The boredom of a video game!Yes, folks.  This game thinks nothing of having you fail a mission, then leaving you in the middle of the desert with no way of getting back to town.  The programmers must have thought it was funny, but I don't.This could have been fixed easily with a ""restart mission"" function, but I believe the programmers deliberately neglected to include something like that because they thought players would find it amusing walking hours through the desert.  I certainly didn't.  I mean, video games are THE THING that you spent hours in traffic so that you can play.  When they themselves are tedious and repetitive, there's something basically wrong with the cosmos.Now, due to the variegated entertainment herein, I was on the point of forgiving the gamemakers and pronouncing the game tolerable after all.  That was until I got to the maddeningly pointless mission, ""Flight School.""  (You can read more details about that particular one elsewhere.)  But that held up the game's progress for DAYS, so difficult was it.  By the time I finished, I forgot what my character was doing and had lost any emotional connection to the game.  It's not that ""Flight School"" was particularly difficult (though it was), it was that it was, like the rest of the game, a recreation of everyday life that was a little too convincing.Here's my guess for what happens in the next outing:  your character has to brush his teeth, launder his underwear, and get his cholesterol checked.",1,worst video game I've ever played,1247875200,"07 18, 2009"

Your ending can be 1 of 4 based on choices you make during the campaign giving you reason to do multiple replays or simply watch all the other endings on youtube. there are strike force missons which play like RTS games but i skipped them.Multiplayer 3.9/5: The biggest problem with multiplayer is the maps. while theres a good amount of maps there are only a handful of good ones. all the maps are made like mw3 and not black ops 1. that means camper heaven and the other huge downside is one side of the map tends to be better giving the team who spawns there a huge advantage. this can be downright frustrating when playing objective based matches. the guns are ok but no returning favorites from black ops 1. i wanted a futuristic galil so bad. oh well.Zombies 5/5: this is the best part of black ops 2 and the main reason i bought the game. the new zombies is all about innovation while sticking to its roots much like what the other COD's claim they do. there are 3 modes with 1 large map and 3 small maps.Tranzit: tranzit is basically the main map or mode of zombies. it feels just like the older games maps but of course adds a bus you can travel to 5 destinations with. you cannot control the bus but sped up or slow down the time when it leaves. the only map with tranzit so far is green run.Green run (Tranzit only): green run has 5 stops. from the bus stop to the diner to the farm to the power plant to the town you will basically play zombies by defeating waves of zombies. however your old strategys from the old maps will not work as well. the mystery box( box where you can buy a random gun) moves to different stops once its used up making you rethink when you have to stay or go to the next stop.Survival: classic gameplay with no stops or bus.bus depot (part of tranzit): the bus depot is small. smaller than the first zombies map ever. its the first stop in tranzit too. since the map is small the mystery box never moves. its a very hard and challenging map.farm: a farm and is the second largrest survival map. it too doesnt have a moving box.town: the largest survival map which is a little bigger than the first map ever made. it has a pack a punch machine and is the only place you can pack a punch other than tranzit mode.GRIEF: Zombies has its own take on multiplayer and you bassically have to outlast another team of 4 players. only town and farm are playable with grief but bus depot is through a glitch somehow.Overall: with a great campaign, decent multiplayer, and new and improved zombies BO2 offers alot.",4,BO2: A game with alot of content,1354838400,"12 7, 2012"

I was hoping for something unique, but what I found was another gear based questing/dungeon/PVP game.  SWTOR's biggest new advancement is full voice acting.  That is a cool new feature, for a while.  But, I found it bored pretty quickly.  I still think it's a great new addition to the MMO genre, but it did start to get old.  I truely felt underwhelmed.  This is the only MMO I've played so far that didn't meet my expectations.I suppose what I was looking for was the gear based questing/dungeon/PVP WoW model with some sandbox elements.  My first MMO was Star Wars Galaxies.  You had a huge amount of freedom in that game.  SWTOR is very linear and confining.  There isn't much to do in the game other than quests/dungeons/PVP.  I stumbled into an auditorium, and I was thinking, ""Cool, players can make shows and have weddings here."".  But, you can't even sit in the chairs.  Why even make an auditorium and not allow players to sit down to enjoy some player created content?There is currently no player housing.  I knew people in SWG that redecorated their houses every few weeks.  It was a big deal to some people.  You could orient items however you liked, and people were so creative.  I remember walking into a house and they had taken boulders and made it look like a cave.  I was blown away.  We use to have block parties, weddings and fashion shows, ext.  We use to have guild wars and could set up turrets to help defend the town.  You could craft in your house, then put them up for auction while still in your house with vendors that you set up.I haven't seen any cosmetic clothing yet.  Maybe I just haven't leveled high enough, but I haven't seen it yet.  For role players, this is kind of a big deal.  Sometimes it was an achievement like getting a full set of stormtrooper armor and a carbine so you could walk around feeling like a stormtrooper.  Even people like me who don't role play enjoy having something different to wear to distinguish you from the crowd.  In WoW, once I got my raid set, that was about it.The character and race selection is horrible.  I didn't find only having four body types to be that big of a deal.  But, I didn't like the hairstyles at all.  And, the little extras like tattoos or horns were all so similar you really couldn't distinguish yourself.  And, all the races were human.  No Wookies, Rodians, ext.  It just feels so confining.So what's the big deal about role playing or sandbox elements?  I worry that the community will become what WoW's community has become.  A bunch of kids or elitist punks.  I've been playing LOTRO the past few months, and I don't think I've heard the word ""noob"" or ""pwned"" once.  It's kind of like the difference between going to a fine dinning restaurant and your local McDonalds.  You don't find a lot of screaming kids in a fine dinning restaurant.  If you want a more mature playerbase, then you have to give them the tools to do other things than obsess on gear and who's 1337.The graphics weren't great, but I was expecting that.  They aren't bad either.  I can't say they were disappointing to me because they were about where I expected them to be.  Not everyone has a maxed out system after all.  I once bought a laptop and couldn't get it to play WoW.  I had to return it and get an upgraded model.  So, I know they were trying to get the maximum amount of people whose systems could handle it.  I can't fault them on that.Ambient sounds are missing from the game.  And I've heard very little of the original soundtrack.  Playing Star Wars Galaxies and hearing the original soundtrack really made me feel like I was in the Star Wars universe, and I was missing that in this game.  I guess I kinda miss the whole timeline from the movies as well.  I miss seeing stormtroopers and AT-AT's and the like.  I just didn't feel immersed in the Star Wars universe that I know and love.  It's someone elses Star Wars universe, not the one I grew up with.Not sure still if I like the group questing in dungeons (flashpoints).  Did one with a person that was lagging pretty bad, and we constantly had to wait for him because you all have to talk to the NPC to get quest dialog at the same time.  It made for a terribly long and boring dungeon.  We could have talked to the NPC and cleared trash while he caught up if we weren't all required to talk at the same time.The space combat is just a mini game.  I think I saw that they may add a more robust space aspect to this game in the future.  Which is fine, Star Wars Galaxies didn't launch with a space feature at all.

I am the type of person that tries to complete every quest, even if they are grey.

EA has really started to drop the ball with newer games. As a result, I tend to only buy previous versions of games. That&#8217;s when I found Tiger Woods 12. Now I almost wish I hadn&#8217;t found it!Okay, I will start off by stating that I am happy with the gameplay. It can be difficult at times, but I really don&#8217;t mind that. I have read some reviews where people had trouble putting. It&#8217;s difficult. Then again, so is putting in real life. Both require practice.The graphics are superb!In fact, if I was only rating gameplay I would likely give it 5 Stars. My issue is not with gameplay.Now let&#8217;s look at the issues with Tiger Woods 12. For starters, you can only back up your save data if you subscribe to Playstation Plus. When I buy a game, I want to be able to do whatever I want with the save files! But putting that aside for a moment, here&#8217;s why I want to toss my copy of this game out of a window. Sometimes when loading a profile, the data will corrupt. Or the data will randomly corrupt while playing. I have 2 PS3&#8217;s so it&#8217;s unlikely that my PS3 is causing it (unless it&#8217;s both consoles with the exact same problem). My friend also owns the game and the same thing happens to him.If your data becomes corrupted, you lose that golfer (unless you have PS Plus). If you are a Plus subscriber (and backed up the files onto cloud storage), then you can download your backed up file and replace the corrupted file. If you don&#8217;t have PS Plus, then you&#8217;re out of luck. However, even if you have PS Plus, you can only download once per day. So what happens if the file corrupts again (which happens a lot)? You must wait 24 hours to play your golfer. Now I ask, why in the hell does EA not let you back up a file that you own, any way you want?!Onto issue 2. EA expects you to spend real money (upwards in the hundreds of dollars) for additional courses. This is a trend that a lot of companies are trying. Look, I can understand adding expansions to a game, but charging for individual courses is just wrong. Whatever happened to the days of unlocking additional content through in-game achievements?Overall, the game itself is not bad, but the glitches will make you want to toss the game (and whoever approved the &#8220;read only save files&#8221; policy) out of the closest window!",2,PS3 Version: Numerous Glitches Will Make you Toss it out of a Window!,1363910400,"03 22, 2013"

2053,132175,AGR4LKC72JEQ8,B002DC8GKO,coopertex,"[1, 2]","Brink is an arena based FPS. The whole gameplay is objective based and it does require teamwork. Which can be frustrating playing by yourself with bots on your team or playing online multiplayer with people that are not interested in helping you, nor completing objective. There are lots of mindless players out there that think about just scoring the most kills. This doesn't win the game! but that is not Brink's fault. Your online experience may certainly vary.Mission objectives can range from: Escorting a robot, or person from point A to point B. Protecting a computer or some other device from enemy hacking or destroying it. Then there is the, Destruction objectives, which are easy to understand. While one team takes on the role of defenders, the other team takes on the role and offensive tactics to complete the objectives.Regardless of the task, there are bullets flying everywhere! And the cool part about the gameplay is that your character is able to run fast, vault over ledges or slide on the ground and of course you can get close enough to smack an enemy with melee. Your character overall is more mobile and faster than most shooters video games. It is a lot of fun, performing these acrobatic feats in First Person View, and it is done very well without any wobbly effects.Brink has been refered to as gun-porn, because there are the usual weapon types: pistols, smgs, rifles, assualt rifles, lmgs, shot guns and grenade launchers. All weapons are initially weak and everyone can almost absorb a whole clip of bullets, but later you can unlock, attachments, and weapon upgrades including armor piercing bullets, and everything has a pro and con about it. So overall it feels technically balanced, but you should try to rake in the XP so you can level up faster, get new perks and unlock weapons.Although after a couple of hours of gameplay, you might get bored with the repetition, everything remains the same (gameplay wise) and there no standard deathmatches or capture the flag modes. It's always objective based and always the same objectives.Even though the graphics are good, they are not up to par with current gen shooters (H3, COD, R6 etc...). Everything looks cartoony and there is an over-saturation of color everywhere. The artist should have also used a different color pallet to seperate the players colors from the foreground and background,The sound effects are outstanding, with all the guns sounding punchy, loud and explosions that will rattle your teeth. The character players have good voice acting and will call out targets, inform you if they need help, and other sound bites.If you like Team Fortress, or Unreal Tournament series, you will feel comfortable with Brink's gameplay. You can play as an engineer, medic, soldier and operative/spy.

1886,191915,AVPG8GLTOVNHV,B005EQE0YM,Patrick H. Nguyen,"[1, 1]","I can't believe I forgot to review this headset!  I've been using it for almost a year now and this headset is simply fantastic.  The setup is pretty simple but there are a lot of wires.  You connect the headset to a USB port to power the headset.  You connect the audio as a passthrough between your 360 console and your audio output (speakers, receiver, etc).  And lastly, you connect the headset to your 360 controller for the mic.  The headset has a breakout box for controlling volume and bass boost as well as a mic mute toggle switch.  You also have a volume control for the chat function as well which is really useful to set the right balance between hearing your friends and hearing the game audio.Note that if you're using HDMI to connect your 360 to your TV, you may need to purchase a $5 audio adapter.  If you don't want to buy the adapter, you may be able to use the RCA outputs on your TV or receiver if they have that feature available for output.  If you're using VGA or component, than the $5 audio adapter is not necessary as those cables already have stereo RCA outputs.The length of cord is extremely long.  You can play across the room with this cord so it's great for a family room setup when you're many feet away from the TV.  I do have a twisting problem with the cable which is annoying.  I tried to hang the cable so that it would straighten out but as soon as you bring the cable down, it'll twist all over the place.The headset is pretty light and comfortable.  It does go over your ears so if you're gaming for extended periods of time, your ears will beg you to take breaks so they can breathe.  The mic boom is extremely long and extremely flexible.  You can put it in virtually any position you can imagine.  The mic is extremely sensitive and will pick up everything, from the creaking of your chair to people talking in the background.  There is zero noise cancellation with this boom.  In fact, the mic is so sensitive, my friends complained when I put the boom directly in front of and near my mouth.  So I basically have the boom going completely straight and I sound great to my friends.  No more the days of having your cheap 360 headset boom practically in your mouth.You can also rotate the boom up and out of the way during the times you don't need to chat or when you want to listen to music.The sound is great for a stereo headset.  The bass boost is effective and while you'll never mistake these for audiophile headphones, you'll enjoy them in your gaming.  Note that these are only stereo so positional sound is not so great in gaming.  This headset will not give you any sort of gaming advantage over external speakers.  However, if you combine this headset with a surround sound audio processor, this headset does offer a great competitive edge.  For 5.1 surround sound, I have my X12 headset hooked up to my DSS2 processor which is an awesome processor!  Check out my DSS2 review for further details.  With the DSS2 and X12, you can pinpoint where all the bad guys are.  I was playing Left 4 Dead 2 and I could hear spitters, boomers, etc. to the point that I could hunt them rather than wait for them to pounce on me.  I could tell if they were above and behind me, in front and below me, etc.  They couldn't hide!  It truly is amazing to game in 5.1 surround.You'll love this headset.  A great benefit of course is the big sound as well as being able to play loud games without bothering other people in the house.  Being wired, you never worry about having to recharge or replace batteries.  I wholly recommend the X12 headset as well as the DSS2 processor.",5,"Great stereo headset!  high quality, long cord, strong sound, great mic",1339545600,"06 13, 2012"

A pros and cons chart seems like the easiest way, so, here it is.Pros:- great graphics for the 3DS- monsters are cool- press turn battle system (hit a weakness and gain a turn, miss or hit a resistance and lose one)- soundtrack is awesome- can revive after losing battles, reducing frustration from having to constantly re-load- fusing demons is as fun and addicting as everCons:- dungeons are all pretty same-y.- battle system is easy to exploit, making battles repetitive and tedious- far too easy to get lost on the world mapOther (good/bad depending on person):- tons of grinding- difficult- very bare-bones story that exists only to send you out to fight more monstersBasically, the game is decent.  The simple story (search for somebody, and do quests for people you meet on the way) is enough to give you a reason to fight monsters, but nothing more.  Battles boil down to finding the enemies weakness and using that attack until you win; if you lose, grind a few more levels and try again.  If you're looking for a grind fest, or a game focused more on a traditional turn-based battle system, you might like this.  If you're looking to collect and fuse demons, or are a fan of Shin Megami Tensei games, you'll love this.

5295,194193,AW2YGFNSJ22QV,B005VKRGXI,Catherine Pahno,"[4, 5]","Ever since I was a little boy, Batman and Spider-man have always been my favorite super heroes and part of what came with that favoritism was playing the games based on said heroes. But as I grew older and my `tastes' improved, I realized that the majority of licensed games were mediocre at best, and downright poorly made trash at worst .Well, that all changed for Batman back in 2009 when `Batman: Arkham Asylum' (Developed by Rocksteady studios), was released. Both it and its sequel,Arkham City(2011) are considered not only some of the best licensed games ever made, but two of the best games ever made that truly do justice to the dark knights legacy.Well, unfortunately for Spider-man, the web slinger hasn't had such luck with his entries in the world of video games. But Benox studios attempts to change that with, `The Amazing Spider-man' (This being the third game the studio has developed for the Spider-man franchise; both of their previous installments received lukewarm reception.)  But after playing the game to completion, my findings are far from amazing. (See what I did there?)It should be noted that the game takes place about 6 months after the movie it is based upon. The premise is very simple and the basics are that the cross-species virus that infected Doctor Connors in the film is still being studied in secret and when a freak accident occurs, it is spread across the city.  And the new head of Oscorp science division, Alistair Smythe, believes that the only way to cure the infection is to exterminate it by using his advanced nanobots/ robotics defense technology. (I.E.  Give Spider-man an excuse to beat up lizard people and robots)And the combat system with which you will provide said beat down is incredibly similar to `Arkham's' system in that it operates  on a  counter and strike system. When an incoming hit is about to strike Spider-man, a small indicator appears over Spider-man's head and you are given a window of time to dodge out of the way and return the favor. And just like in the Arkham games a little combo meter builds up as you deliver punishment which allows the player to unleash flashier moves to help finish the job. But Beenox's take on the combat that Rocksteady made perfect, is relatively sloppy.  For one the indicator above Spider-man's is incredibly small and often hard to see when things get chaotic. It also doesn't help that the games camera focuses far too much on spider-man during combat and not enough on the whole environment. (The frustration on what you can and can't see increases when Spider-man takes too much of a licking, and the screen goes a hazy red.)  This lead to me getting sucker punched by enemies I couldn't see or couldn't react to until it was too late. The small indicator, coupled with the bad camera, gives even the lowest of thugs the chance to make Spider-man look like a total chump.Other than the combat, there is another mechanic in place that allows Spider-man to explore the closed levels or the open-world Manhattan with more ease other than his normal web swinging, know as the `Web Rush'. This ability allows the player to slowdown time and command Spider-man to go to a highlighted destination. When this works, it works well and looks impressive from a cinematic perspective since Spider-man leaps and bounces off of walls and buildings with the agility you would expect from the hero. But even in this aspect I ran into some hiccups.  Like I said, when this works, it works great. But there are moments when it causes great frustration.  Sometimes the ability is very finicky and will often either stop short of where you told Spider-Man to go and he will (On the very rare occasions that I saw. ) be stuck floating hilariously in mid-air, or end up in a different spot altogether. As you can imagine this is incredibly bothersome. Especially if you have to get to a specific area within a certain amount of time, or retrieve a certain item in a specific spot.As you complete combat scenario's, explore the world, and finish certain story objectives, this net's the wall crawler experience points which can be used to purchase upgrades to improve his attack strength, resistance to gunfire, rate at which he fires his webs, etc. But besides the ones I just mentioned and a few others, I found that either certain upgrades they gave me were given to me too late in the game to be useful, or just weren't useful to begin with. This may just be my tastes coming into play but the game never gave me a reason to try another tactic or a new ability out when the best and easiest option was just to rush in and beat people up the same way I was during the games opening moments, all the way to its climax.This brings me to the game's final and worst fault:  Its repetitive nature.  When you boil the game down it has three main pillars to the way it's structured: Go to a certain area, defeat the enemies that spawn there, and bring down some sort of technological obstacle through a button prompt.  Rinse and repeat. Even its side-missions are many of the exact same side- missions I have done in almost every single Spider-man in the past (Stop a mugging, disable a car chase by covering the suspects windshield in web fluid, and get an injured civilian to a hospital by web swinging them there.) What made the Rocksteady Batman games great is that they utilized the full facet of the hero's personality and abilities. Batman is a warrior who knows 127 different self-defense styles, a master detective, and a stealthy predator who strikes fear into the hearts of his foes. They mixed all three together into a near flawless experience and made sure to pace the game in a proper way to make sure the player was never sick of what they were doing. By the time they were finished doing one thing, they were off to do something different. Here it's just, ""Like to beat people up using a combat system that isn't as good as the game that it's originally from?  No? Well get ready to do it anyway.""  Now, I'm not a huge comic book guy but I'm pretty sure there are other things you can draw from in order to define Spider-man other than to beat people up.I feel like I'm beating the game down a little too much but there isn't anything super noteworthy.  I admit there are a couple cool set piece moments, exploring the city by web swinging is pretty cool, and Spider-man does have some cool animations (He's the height of the games visuals. The environments textures are a little `muddy' and the other character models are the epitome of the `video game person stereotype' from weird, twitchy, and robotic animations to zombie like, empty eyes) Heck, I'll admit I even had fun for the first couple of hours.

In Sonic Adventure it displays a freaky little Chao pretty much the whole time. In Crazy Taxi it just had an animation loop. So the ugly useless screen is out for me until I find a game that uses it. Then the buttons. WHAT ARE THE BUTTONS FOR? It goes IN the controller and the buttons are COVERED UP. When I take it out it just sits like a brick and does not display anything. So why the cute little D-pad and tiny little A/B? As a memory card it functions well and is conveniently placed. Yet after five games I ran out of memory. FIVE GAMES! My Gamecube memory card has close to 20 games on it and is only half full. Even my junky third party PS2 memory card holds more. I could hardly fit a Chao onto it.

So I am not going to mention how fun it is.Instead, I would like to point out the pros and cons of Wii at the current 2.0U firmware. Things may change for future firmware updates.The reason I give 3 Stars is because I average two major categories: Innovation and Technology.  I give Innovation for 5 stars, and technological achievement and convenience for 2 stars.Motion Sensing technology is nothing new, it has been applied to cell phone gaming and vehicle air bags for quite a while.  The system is barely an upgrade from the Gamecube.  It is extremely inconvenient to share game save data compare to PS3 and even Gamecube.  The innovation point is how Nintendo has achieved to redesign the motion sensors for even better game play experience.Pros:- Parental Control- Able to count amount of time user has spent to play different Wii channels. Best for parents tracking kids video game time.- Motion Sensing Controller is extremely similar as Playstatoin 3's Six-Axis Controller.  This brings brand new intuitive gaming experience.- Bluetooth wireless technology in Wii Remote prevents cord wind up hazzles and less wireless signal interference.- AC Adaptor is separated from the console. This makes it the smallest Next Generation Console on the Market at this moment.- Backward Compatibility to Gamecube and Virtual Consoles.- White color in a very clean design.- Built in WiFi for internet downloads.- New Internet Browser is available for download in April 2007- Cheapest amaong XBOX360 and PS3- Suitable for all ages as long as you can hold the remote and know how to swing it.- My 90 Year Old Grandpa was able to get a strike in bowling, hole in one in Golf, some tennis racket swing and boxing punches.Cons:- Games are not Region Free. Unlike Playstation3 and PSP, that are region free, user cannot play import games at all without modifying their Wii's hardware.  American gamers are going to miss out a lot of interesting Japanese games such as Gundam, Naruto, Super Robot War, and many many others, even those games that don't really require people to understand Japanese!- Unable to count the amount of time the user playing Gamecube games.- Cannot easily exchange the game save data from one Wii to another. Let me elaborate this problem.If you want to share your Zelda progress to another friend, you cannot simply store your game save in the SD card and bring to your friend's house to load in his Wii console.  Instead, you have to do the following1. overwrite his save file. Make sure you tell your friend to backup his own save data. Or,2. if he hasn't played the game yet, you have to create a save file by playing the game and save at the first save point.  After that, you have to overwrite the the save on the console with the one in the SD card.- You must need a gamecube memory card and controller to play Gamecube games.  You cannot backup or save any data on the Wii console's internal 512MB memory nor SD card.  If you want to know how ripoff Nintendo is on Gamecube memory cards, please read my other reviews on ""Gamecube memory card 1019 and 59 Blocks"".- The system resets itself even from minor configuration.- Cannot use the Wii Remote to call up the system menu when playing Gamecube.  Therefore, you cannot even turn off the system with the remote.- Lacking DVD movie support even Wii game disc has the memory and physical size of a DVD.- The system gets warm during standby mode. Not sure the power consumption during Standby mode.  Anybody can clearify this?- It does not have an option for automatic firmware update in standby mode.- Somtetimes takes nearly 30 minutes or more to receive messages or Mii from other players.- Virtual Console Account is depended on the system's serial number instead of an online account.  That means if you have purchased any games/software from Wii Shop and suddenly your Wii is malfunctioning, either for an exchange or brand new replacement, you CANNOT redownload the contents for free in any replacement system.  You might need to contact Nintendo regarding to giving you back the Wii Points for in-store exchange/manufacture warrenty to redownload the content to the replacement system.- It creates a noise from the disc reader trying to read the disc even the slot is empty everytime the user resets or turn on the sytem.- Currently, most games are party games, it is fun when you have a buch of friends sitting side by side to each other.  There is currently no online games available.- The GPU and CPU is a lot inferior compare to XBOX360 and PS3; therefore, the graphics and controls are really bad especially for any kind of First Person Shooters.

Also, you have the opportunity to commandeer a satisfyingly large selection of vehicles, from the painfully slow Spider Tank to the recklessly fast Speeder-for-one, each with different weapons. The twist is in the ""scoring"" system, a twist that makes all the difference. Each segment of play is a battle with an equal number of forces on each side. The AI of each side eliminates the other with roughly equal success, so what you do will ultimately determine the outcome. You may win by eliminating the opposing forces, or by capturing and holding each spawn point for 20 seconds. The latter is almost impossible without doing the former, but that's ok. It's fun to advance, hold a spawn point, take out some more guys, or use your rocket launcher against vehicles, or kick back and snipe. There are so many different levels, each requiring different tactics, that this is a real treat. Two-player pvp mode is the most intense, as you watch the numbers at the top of your screen, representing your forces and those of your enemy, whittle down toward victory or defeat.

The soundtrack is terrible (the blandest of dubstep) and the menus feel too cartoon-y and childish for my taste -- you're greeted with a giant-headed animal thing. The cutscenes aren't animated, just still images with voices. In this day and age, this is completely unacceptable for a game.I begin a match in some sort of Chinese restaurant that looks like it was drawn in MS Paint. There are onion-headed onlookers and a Kung Fu master who also has an onion head. I'm pretty confused as to what is going on. The stage starts breaking apart, I die once -- and still, I somehow defeat Sly Cooper. The next match, I have to face two others enemies. Okay. The stage appears to be some sort of building with low-res textures that rival PSX graphics. I defeat them after a long and boring battle, and the number of opponents goes to three.And it goes on and on from here. Pretty soon, I get to the final boss who looks like a giant unfinished model.

2221,38879,AKMJJES6FE2M5,B00009ECGK,Andrew C.,"[13, 14]","I had a lot of fun with this game, much more than I thought I would.  Warcraft 3 is a good old-fashion real-time strategy (RTS) game, with a somewhat outdated resource collection model and base-building formula.  It also aspires to be a roleplaying game (RPG), thought it is only partially successful.  Overall, if you like RTS games, this one is worth a try.  However, I found it not to be as good as some of the more recent games, like Rise of Nations and Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War.Gameplay: Warcraft 3 is remarkably like Warcraft 2 in a lot of ways, which is both good and bad.  On the good side, it's fairly easy to learn and quite fun for a while.  You choose one of four races to play (which are all distinct); gather gold, lumber, and food; build structures and units; explore the map; and conquer your enemies. It's a very typical 1990s-style RTS game.  However, Warcraft 3 adds hero units to the mix, which greatly impact gameplay.  These units can gain levels as in a RPG-style game and have special abilities. You really cannot win a game without them.  Each race has a choice of 4 heroes to choose from (with The Frozen Throne expansion loaded) and there are neutral heroes that can be recruited.  The hero model works quite well with the single-player campaign, since it weaves them into a broad story.  However, it makes skirmish games a little awkward, since you are required to both build bases and find creeps (random monsters) for your hero to fight in order to gain levels.The single-player campaign is both quite long and well done.  Actually, it seemed a little too long once I played through the original campaign and the Frozen Throne expansion.  The story is the typical good vs. evil theme, which gets really hard to follow by the mid-point.  However, the missions are generally well done, with a good mix of RPG-style adventuring and a heavy-dose of base-building and conquest.  The missions are designed to allow you the chance to play all four races, and I didn't get the sense that they were just practice for multiplayer online games.  That is, for solo gamers like myself, Warcraft 3 has a substantial amount of single-player content.Warcraft 3 is good, but does have some issues.  Some of the single-player missions are quite hard and will require much reloading of saved games in order to complete.  Still, the AI can be a little lame.  There were countless times that my base would be invaded, and my units would not automatically move to fight the enemy.  However, AI enemies do fight smart, often first attacking your units that can do the most damage to them.  Rather surprisingly, the game does not have a pause feature so that you can look around the battlefield and give orders while pausing.  And unlike recent RTS games, Warcraft 3 limits you to very small armies.  You'll be lucky to have 20 fighting units at any given time.  Additionally, the game just seems behind the times in other ways.  The camera doesn't really zoom, graphics are cartoonish, and the micromanagement can be burdensome at times.As with every other Blizzard product I've played, the game was perfectly stable and well polished, and I came across no bugs or typos.  In addition to a single-player campaign that will last around 70+ hours for the average player, there are a large number of skirmish maps included, multiplayer capacity, and a map editor. The Battle Chest itself includes a lot of reading materials, such as instruction manuals and hints/tips guides.  As usual, Blizzard has supported the game well with patches and new official maps that are downloadable at their website.Graphics: The typical Warcraft visuals.  A bit cartoonish, but with a lot of vivid colors and diverse environments.  Spell effects look convincing, and there are day & night cycles that give the world a living feel. The game is actually cute in many ways and is probably supposed to be that way. The graphics will not win any awards, but they do serve their purpose.  As with Diablo 2, Warcraft 3 has some of the best cutscenes I have ever seen in a video game.Sound: There is a lot of great voice acting in the game.  Some of it is very funny.  The music is also well done and appropriate to the mood of the game.Overall, I recommend Warcraft 3 (plus the expansion) to anyone interested in RTS or fantasy games.  It's a well-made strategy game with lots of challenges, a epic (though rambling) story, and an RPG element in the form of heroes (which, again, can be a plus or a minus). If you can get past all of the micromanagement that the game requires and some other outdated elements, Warcraft 3 should provide many hours of entertainment.",4,"Very good game, but not quite great",1122422400,"07 27, 2005"

4085,202659,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B007V5FRDM,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[18, 24]","For its price, this DLC gives you what amounts to little more than a multiplayer-only mod in no way superior to other mods done by amateurs and posted for free on TaleWorlds' modification forums.  The only unique aspect here is that it's been officially commissioned by the gamemakers, given a few lines of spoken dialogue, and charged money for it.Mount & Blade is incredibly diverse in its modding capabilities, and over the years since its first release, has seen people mod the game to play as realistic Medieval or ancient combat, to Feudal Japanese settings, even to modern era gunpowder mods set in the American Old West or even World War II.This mod in particular does what I've long thought to be a fun challenge for gamemakers such as those behind the Call of Duty franchise to explore; the days when firing off a single shot was a big deal and often resorting to the bayonet was more likely to save you than stopping to reload.History Channel games tried this approach with their Civil War games, and avoided the need for formations or fellow soldiers by having it be ""special ops"" type missions involving one man as a spy.But this mod shows that such a thing can be accomplished and can be fun.  It works out wonderfully here, it could work out amazingly well as a Call of Duty game.The biggest problem however is that the limitations of the historical technology would mean that more stuff would need to be added.  If gunplay is to be hindered by realistic reload times and poor firing accuracy, additional gameplay features need to be given; expanded melee combat, perhaps, specialized tasks to be accomplished, many different game modes and wider variety of weapon choices.This mod does the best it can with game modes like Siege, Battle, Team Deathmatch, and having the ability to change as various infantry types, cavalry, even artillerymen able to use cannons with all the proper steps---loading, cleaning the barrel, pushing the cannon forward, aiming, igniting the fuse.But it doesn't do enough;- The gunplay is identical to that used in half a dozen gunpowder mods, stepped down by having no ability to zoom in via looking down the barrel's iron sights.- The melee combat is in no way changed or updated from the base game; swords and spears and bludgeoning weapons all operate exactly the same way, with a long thin sword being wielded exactly the same as a stubby dagger or a curved cavalry sabre.- A lot of the weapons have little or no explanation to them.  Cavalry and infantry muskets appear to be completely identical, save that cavalry muskets have no bayonets.  Rifles appear, but are in no way faster or more accurate than muskets.  A standard (re, flag) can be used as a lance-like weapon but I've never seen it actually hurt or kill someone run down by it.  Artillerymen/engineers are given shovels that can't be used as weapons and no explanation given as to when and where they can be used for sapping.- Bayonets instantly kill if they touch you.  No other melee weapon does this, not swords or spears or axes; if an enemy stabs you with a bayonet, you pretty much die instantly.- All battle modes are essentially the same; as all war game shooters are likely to be, everyone wanders about on their own, hunting and killing members of opposing teams, only occasionally working together in groups of two or three, but rarely more.  While it would be impractical to get enough people to form up in a line as real Napoleonic soldiers would, there isn't even the slightest attempt to encourage such a thing, no added bonuses to accuracy or firepower to reward people for firing together en masse, no game modes that would stress this sort of gameplay.And despite the gameplay modes of Siege, Team Deathmatch, Battle and so on, every gamemode is basically the same; the only difference lies in patience.  If you're willing to join a game and have to wait 10 minutes for the round to end before spawning for the first time, only to wait again if and when you die seconds after spawning (team killing is always enabled), you can join Battle mode.  Team Deathmatch allows for infinite instant respawns.  Siege mode involves one side attacking an entrenched enemy, though boredom so often gets the better of people and defenders simply go out in search of targets to kill.Then, the people.  As with any multiplayer game, you're liable to have to deal with people who think it's fun to teamkill, or turn their mouse sensitivity all the way up so they can spin circles around you while flailing their swords like the Tasmanian Devil, or what people in the games call ""horse noobs"" who always pick cavalry, and always run down people from behind, a typical and legitimate tactic even in real life, yet somehow exacerbated by everyone wandering around on their own, no formations, and with bayonets barely ever scratching horses as they pass by.Managing to land your first shot on someone and kill them would be a giddy experience, but more often than not you'll end up frustrated not so much that your shot has missed close to point-blank range, but that your target will simply rush up to you, stabbing with their bayonet, and incessantly circling around you while strafing side to side in a way I think even real life Napoleonic soldiers in a melee would've been unable to manage while stabbing with their bayonets without tripping and falling.As a game mod, it is spectacularly done, though gets tiresome quickly, particularly being multiplayer-only.  As something that would cost you money, it's hardly worth the expense.  You would have a far better gameplay experience downloading a Napoleonic Wars mod available for free and fighting with an intelligent AI, more likely to fight realistically for the period.  Otherwise, why bother with a Napoleonic Era mod; there are more players playing the base game online to melee with.",2,Glorified mod,1343174400,"07 25, 2012"

Bandits to hunt, fellow stalkers to save, artifacts to acquire, guns to maintain, but sadly the story is quite lacking.  Albeit practically devoid until you reach the final area of Pripyat.  By this point you are pretty much decked out with awesome gear from the zone, whether you bought and ordered the ridiculously overpowered guns or special armour from Nimble, or procured the Gauss Rifle your pretty much bound to finish the game quite quickly after these two objectives are complete.  Meaning really their is quite a lot to do, but it won't take you much more time to do it even after walking and sprinting there.  Which brings me to a major problem with the game's various areas.  Its comprised of three major parts of the ""zone"" which are all quite vast areas to explore and find yourself in all sorts of random heaps of trouble when wandering about them, but what is seen as a quite a triumph over Shadow of Chernobyl's linear level design, is also the major problem with this game.  The engine is severely dated, the DirectX 11 effects look no better, beyond tessellation or SSAO, than say DirectX 10 which the previous game unveiled alongside its features at its release.  You aren't going to be missing out on anything utilizing Enhanced Dynamic Lighting which is rendering in DirectX 9 either.  Indeed you will be hard-pressed noticing the subtle differences between DX10 and DX11 on ""high"" or ""extra"" settings without a few still-frame shots side-by-side each other.  The engine is laced with hiccups, in an open-world first person shooter, that doesn't truly support the performance needed when you have a lighting engine that is working out every little shadow, every little object, and every creature or person in it moving about all the time.  So you get these wonderful little load times (stuttering) in-game at pretty much all times.  It was a problem in the previous entries in the series and it was one glaring problem that wasn't dealt with in any way.  Its not even diminished and can seriously cause major distractions for the player.  In the end the engine is really not taking advantage of the hardware like it should be and also hogging resources casting Sun shadows and SSAO effects that are difficult to notice without a well trained eye.  However, it does allow the atmosphere to really sink into the player and for that I can see why it was made to look the way it does.  At least the style used by the graphics designers will still turn heads many years from now, though I don't think it will garner much attention for its horrid animations, broken dialogue, broken cinematic sequences, broken A.I. or broken attempts at making the world of the ""zone"" feel actually alive.  Of course the achievements in-game help spell out what you're doing and it is nice to feel like you're being rewarded for being ""nice"" too.  I.E. Stalkers charge you less in the first areas once you gain their trust or do a few missions and will help you get to places at cheaper costs (quick traveling).  It is certainly nice to see some progression for once, but ultimately by the time you wind up in Pripyat its basically the end of the game.  Believe me, after going around for an hour or two collecting artifacts to sell them for a ridiculously huge chunk of cash just to spend that money on the best suits, guns and items in the game only to pass through one tiny tunnel just to get to Pripyat, that took more time preparing to go through it than actually getting there.  Which is the problem, quests took their time in Shadow of Chernobyl and here its very obvious that they wanted a smoother transition through the side-missions you accepted so that less could be ""borked"" by one mistake on the players behalf.  Going to a place, to get a thing, by killing everyone there- is a fairly simple objective.  Its made even more simple when you simply don't care about anything going on or the characters you are helping or screwing over.  The irony is that the third and final installment really drives the point home that the post-apocalyptic ""zone"" is no longer as mysterious as it once was.  It lacks the rhythm, albeit the clunky pacing, of the first game in the series.  It lacks some of the secretive nature of what they were presumably trying to build up.  Don't get me wrong, the game play shows how much they've really improved upon the first two games, but the problem here is that the story is not engaging.  In the first game it wasn't obvious what you needed to do and yet by the end of the 3rd game it was pretty much shoved into your face all the time.  You really only needed to play it a few times to see what ""happens"" if you kill too many people from one faction, or follow more of the bandit missions or running to cover outside before an emission hit (which are still really cool and frightening experiences) and you pretty much knew exactly what to do (fetch-quest-y).  Due to the incredibly buggy nature of the first game, it seems to lack that charm of really trying to be this huge dangerous universe it set out to be.  It tries so hard to make the game ""easier"" to follow and to play that you forget about the daunting dangers around you.  So action is amazing, the zone is cool, the artifacts are better, the combat is better and the creatures in the zone pose a bigger threat than they ever were before.  However, the story is not engaging.  We really wanted to figure out who we were playing as, who we were, why we were such a nobody in the first couple of games in the series, but they tacked on this atrocious self-made character at the beginning of this game and it really threw me out of the whole plot.  Its a shame we won't see Strelok anytime soon though and its a shame that this was the last great, but very flawed S.T.A.L.K.E.R. installment.",3,An otherwise superb experience marred by a particularly abrubt ending,1344297600,"08 7, 2012"

Single player is the stereotypical 4 hour long campaign with a barely explored story and little depth. The ending is more like a quarter way point, wrapping up and closing off nothing in the overall scheme of things and not even feeling like a climax had happened before the credits started rolling. To make matters worse, it's barely playable. The game crashed on me roughly 5-10 times throughout my playthrough. When the AI moved during in-game cutscenes, I was pushed around and locked into corners, needing to glitch out of them once trapped. After about halfway into the game, I started experiencing what felt like multiplayer lag, where my aim would jerk around violently and my character would sometimes run in one direction only to be taken back, boosted forward, or be slightly off course while doing so. I've still got no idea how multiplayer glitching could be experienced during a non-internet based single player mode. I actually feel grateful that, unlike many others, I never experienced my save file becoming corrupted or one of the many, many other problems this game has been claimed to have.This is a buggy, rushed, cash in. The single player campaign is tacked on and there are far too many glitches and issues to be worth anything even after patches. I can only imagine how terrible the multiplayer must be, the thing this game seems to solely care about, if the campaign was this horrible.

Needlessly drive somewhere, shoot some enemies in corridors and small rooms, drive back.  Rinse and repeat.  Guns feel good to shoot, but I honestly wouldn't pay more than $20 for this.  Expected more from ID, as I'm one of the people that loved Doom 3 and Quake 4 (which also used the Doom 3 engine).I would rate it a 3.5 if not for the gamebreaking issue (at least for me - it gave me headaches).  EVERY time you stop forward motion of your character, it takes about 1 second for the full detail of the graphics to render.  It's like constant draw-in.  It's not going to be a big deal to some, and it's going to drive some absolutely crazy.  Unfortunately for me, I'm in that second group.  And even though I own a 360 (which reportedly does not suffer from this issue), I'm not dealing with 3 discs for the game.  Maybe it's just me, but I would've been fine with 30FPS instead of 60 if it meant not dealing with this issue.  It just totally kills the game for me.  Just my opinion and my preference as a gamer.I had also just finished pumping 60 hours into Dark Souls, so this game was unfortunate enough to come right after that.  Still, I found the entire experience pretty mediocre.  When the graphics do render, they're beautiful...but does it look any better than Gears 3? No.  So why did they need to focus so much on graphics layering that it took up 3 discs on the 360 when Epic had no problems doing Gears 3 on one disc?  No idea.  Pretty dumb, though.

NOT only are the graphics bad but the game play is not much better. Besides the fact that when you walk you look like you have something rather large in your butt making your player look VERY stiff, and has for the story, WAIT there was a story here??? well if there was anything to do with a story then i must have missed it, the so called story here is not at ALL good in fact it was just pain boring and luckily for me was VERY short beating it in under 2 hours. Ok now on to the level design, well lets just say that it was some of the worst i have seen. It goes like this, run into to dark boring room shoot a few bad guys or zombies then move to the next room that looks almost the same then repeat and do again for the next few hours. Ok so now i will move to the sound of the game, so the zombies when you kill them it sounds OK at best, but as for the sound of the guns WOW OMFG the worst EVER sounds weaker then a nerf guns!!!! the voice overs are very bad as well. Ok now onto the only kind of fun in this game, the only time i had ANY fun on this game was when i played with friends, but even still it was very boring. There is a ranking system that is mediocre at best, the more enemy's you kill the more XP you will get, and when you earn XP you can buy guns that wont really care to use because they all for the most part suck, or you can buy powers for the different players you can choose from. I would also like to add in the fact that when i you enemy it is almost completely random as to when they die, sometimes it will only take a few shoots to kill a simple solder and other time the same kind of enemy will take a clip and a half to kill, as well as that but the hit indication is very OFF. So i will wrap this up by saying this, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, rent it first to see for yourself. i hope someone can find fun in this game, but for me i could not find much fun here.I forgot to add in here that the AI IS THE WORST IN ANY GAME EVER. your team mates make no attempt whatsoever to avoid danger or even bother to shoot at the enemy, your friendly AI will spend the bulk of their time wasting ammo on a wall or ceiling if they are even shooting at ALL, the rest of the time they are just in your way block you in doorways or blocking your shots, never before have i ever seen AI worse than this. As for the enemy AI they are just as bad, half the time the enemy is just standing there as i am shooting them.SO this game is pretty much a FAIL on every level, its a broken game, But lets hope that resident evil 6 will make up for this REALLY REALLY BAD GAME",1,last gen game,1332460800,"03 23, 2012"

Most of them are on the negative side of the fence, and I fail to understand why people just don't appreciate this video game more. Sure, I've read the complaints, but they are nit-picky and shallow. What makes a game a good game, is the actual content and fun factor. STOP COMPARING GAMES TO OTHER GAMES! When someone rates a game, you are not supposed to strictly compare it to the PC version... do not base your reviews on the PC version. Base your review on the GAME ITSELF.

Not only is the game easy where it should be easy, but it is challenging where it should be challenging. You get to work to acheive your character's goals and aspirations, so that you can keep moving up the food chain. What really makes this game good is the first-person controlling!

The blood sprays in all directions with every gunshot and impale. The one drawback is that you computer has to be high-end.

I am a LONG time gamer, I have lots of love for all genres especially JRPGs and I am fairly lenient on games. I try to find enjoyment in games that are simply un-enjoyable or have many issues. However I am sorry to say that Fable: The Lost Chapter brings a new definition to the term ""Garbage."" It is simply the worst game I have ever played in my entire life. Now I will tell you why:Story - It blows. It is very disjointed and is hardly enjoyable. It is your very basic story about your family being killed and rising to become a hero to beat the evil. Nothing more, and nothing less. I'm fine with that, but the way the story presents itself is dreadful.Voice Acting - Atrocious Crap. A 5 year old child could bring more emotion to characters than the people who did this. It is unbelievable in every sense of the word. The characters seems lifeless and the voice actors are annoying.Music - Nothing memorable at all. I know you don't have Nobuo Uem, or Tsuyoshi Sekito but damn not one good track at all?Gameplay - It's bad. You will essentially be button mashing the entire game with the exception of occasionally healing yourself or casting a lame animation spell. The good/bad system in the game is flawed beyond belief. I know that if you commit bad deeds you should be punished but this game FORCES you to be a good guy or else you will have to pay massive amounts of money which is simply impossible. The entire system is unnecessary if you can't choose.Technical Issues - Loads of them. There is pop-in, screen tearing, freezing, and many other various glitches in the game. My favorite game of the current generation is bug ridden as well (The Last Remnant) but at least it had good VA, Story, Gameplay, and AMAZING music.I know this is coming off as a HUGE rant and I don't mean to offend any of the Fable fans. However I was just extremely disappointed with this game after hearing just glowing impressions from them. I am just ashamed that I spent 12 dollars on this and I bought the 2nd one as well which I am just horrified to open.I'm sorry Peter M, but if your other games are as bad as this one I will have to agree with your comment about you never making a good game.

I was excited for this game when I saw the trailer- how dark it looked and how sick the action was made me pumped. And then I got this game.This game is nothing new. Just different characters. The gameplay is actually shorter than Halo 3. 4-6 hours? That's it? And actually, it's WORSE than Halo 3. Halo 3 was disappointing at times, but at least it had its moments. But this is just... bad. To the two other people who commented on my Halo Wars review and said that my calling Halo Wars ""Terrible"" was lying- yeah, go on and tell me that for not liking this game. But be warned; at least I don't devote myself to the series.The main character is... in a word... boring. We hadrly know a thing about him at all. And he dies every time somone looks at him weird, just like in the the game of ""The World Is Not Enough"", you can shoot the wall and someone can die.Another thing is that while this game is being advertised as a new game in the series, it's not that- it's just an expansion pack. They are charging $60 for an expansion pack. This should be downloadable and not full price.The one redeeming factor is the HD gaming. The game looks gorgeous in HD!

A great storyline, three huge cities and a variety of cars to explore and a very nice soundtrack all make Driver3 the best of the series so far.Firstly, the gameplay is the same as that of Driver and Driver2; chasing down the bad guys, avoiding the police and yeah, smashing cars!Driver3 features 2 basic modes; Undercover and free ride. I've completed a vareity of missions and I have to say that they're exciting aswell as fun however some tend to be quite short. Nevetheless, Driver3 doesn't lose it's charm. Secondly, the soundtrack is great with nice beats which change from scenario to scenario, for example where there is a car chase in progress expect the music to be loud and vice versa. Cineamtics add to the deep storyline and occur after every mission, so expect many!Concerning the graphics, Driver3 loses a star. The graphics don't fully utilise the Playstation2's capabilities and sometimes it may feel that you're playing Driver3 on the Playstation instead of the PS2. Nevertheless, the cinematics are very realistic and car damage is as real as you can expect; tire's bursting, debris flying around(I actually took a sedan underneath a parked truck and made it into a convertable!)and real world physics.In conlusion Driver3 may feel like Dejavu; been there, done that.

First off, I recommend only people who have never played this game before to purchase it.As far as the actual gameplay goes, Rayman is a mixed bag.  Rayman earns his moves Banjo-Kazooie style from a fairy and runs, jumps, and later, swings and glides, throughout MANY levels.  The variety apparent in the levels is sometimes great. You'll turn tiny to fit through gaps or, using your spinning hair as blades, cut ropes attached to giant stones and a huge stone slap while dodging obstacles to prevent yourself from drowning in the water below (one of the game's most intense scenarios). But alas, this is where the problem in the game lies.  This game is VERY, VERY DIFFICULT. It will take countless tries to get past certain levels.  This wouldn't normally be so bad. The catch is you have a limited number of continues to get through the game, resulting in only about a total of 50 tries.  This problem will not seem apparent in the first stages, but 75% of the game will frustrate even seasoned gamers, and INFURIATE anyone below a good skill level.Thankfully, the rest of Rayman is a joy to play.  Aside from polygon powerhouses such as Iridon 3D and Tony Hawk 2, you won't be seeing better graphics on the GBA thus far.  The music is surprisingly good also.  And the huge, hulking bosses are a great diversion from the regular game, as are Mr. Hat's various minigames. If you feel the hunger for some platforming action, Castlevania is the way to go.  If you're not into that series, get this.  But be warned - if anger management classes aren't up your alley, or you're getting this for a kid as their first game - get Mario Bros. Advance instead.",3,Be Wary of Rayman...,993340800,"06 24, 2001"

I love GT2 and GT3, GT4 is fantastic and absolutely gorgeous but I thought they messed up the driving physics a little).  In GT5 the graphics are great, the physics are good, and it is overall a very good racing sim.  Considering how race cars are supposed to be driven, the feel is spot-on and quite addictive, but strangely the overall experience is kind of disappointing and frustrating.  Hard to describe.  The online racing is OK and will probably improve as patches become available.  Be aware GT5 has some glaring shortcomings.  First, the load times are long, sometimes very long, which can hamper any gaming experience especially online when trying to beat the countdown.  Second, some familiar tracks in the GT series are missing in this one: Seattle, Apricot Hill and Midfield are obvious omissions; also missing are Seoul, Hong Kong, and the traditional Rome circuit.  Although there are some great new tracks (Cape Ring is awesome), nothing is more entertaining than the 'staircase' in Seattle reverse and its absence is unforgivable.  At least Autumn Ring is also present.  Finally, the B-spec driver (let's call him Bob) is a complete idiot.  Granted, Bob starts with very little driving experience but come on, his driving is truly moronic.  I mean, really??!!  Bob will spin out the car, hit the brakes unnecessarily and often, and generally drive badly, as if the win is irrelevant.  I guess Polyphony forgot that auto racers will 'push.'  Even worse, if Bob finally gets a good lead, after passing the competition his temperament calms to a casual/cool level where the competition may catch up and pass him in a few laps.  Hopefully Bob's skill will improve rapidly with some progress through the B-spec portion.  I'm about 30% through the game, enough to give an adequate review.  This game gets a rather disappointing 3 stars, especially considering the long development cycle and the PS3's power and potential.EDIT: Update versions 1.06 and 1.07 recently came out -- they fixed some issues and improved a lot of the features in this game.

I really hate it when I am playing an area, stop playing, start up the game later and have crashes in areas that were working OK the previous time I played. The crashes seem random and can happen anywhere in the game world at any time. Same thing happening in FO3. The bottom issue is that there are just to many bugs in this game for being released at this time. Aren't they EVER going to fix that issue ????I swear that eventually there will be as many updates going on for these games as there are for the PC Windows OS. The one thing I also don't like hearing is, ""well, go to such an such a site and get this and that to - hopefully - fix a problem. What I am saying here is that for the money and the tight Steam mandated online subscription control there should be almost zero issues with this game.The side quests can get to be so convoluted that it starts taking the fun out of playing. The graphics are dated and no different then FO3. There is one quest that is just absolutely ridiculous. It seems more like a joke on gamers then cool challenge to be met. I think the game should be priced lower as it does not seem as all encompassing as FO3.

Well, they got that part right, but not much else.  The game basically consists of you entering a level at one point, randomly digging all over the entire map, then searching for the exit.  There is no online multi-player as the 'Wi-Fi' logo on the box might lead you to believe, only local ad-hoc (that is, once you dig up the randomly placed cube needed to unlock that function).  You also have to locate other hidden cubes to unlock such basic features as say, using the cards that are included in the box.  Who thought up this genius idea?  This is a kid's game!  Another stinging point is no direct control over the Spectrobes themselves, just your main character who dies almost instantly any time he recives damage in a battle.  You can only use the L & R buttons to activate Spectrobes' attacks, while trying to position your player without dying.

(Better than 4) It is by far the largest Rock Star games game map yet.(Coming close to just cause 2)I also like what they added on top of keeping the high def universe. these include the return of; airplanes, the military, car modifications, and weapons. They brought all these things back from GTA San Andreas. The driving physics are ALLOT better! It feels much more realistic than GTA 4. And I like how you can role your car back on its wheels if it gets rolled over to the point where its unrecoverable(like in 4) I do wish you can have the option of picking the lock instead of smashing the window and having to pay to get it fixed later. The flying physics are sloppy. It almost feels like I'm flying a plane in GTA SA with a broken flap. The planes and helicopters are hard to stabilize. I guess it's because of the low flying skill of the characters when you first start. But if they were going for realism in GTA 5, the airplanes would fly much more stable even for a beginner pilot. I know this from using flight simulators in real life. But Rock Star wanted to keep in old school and implement stats like driving, lung capacity, flying, and a few new ones. They do have cheats again but they are limited compared to GTA SA. There's hardly any vehicle spawning cheats (as far as I know there's only about 6 vehicle cheats and the only good ones are the attack helicopter and the one sports car. The only airplane cheat is the stunt plane but I'd rather have the harrier jet or F35 jet. They also brought back taxi cab missions but no vigilante missions on cop cars or military vehicles. You make a good amount of money doping a day of taxi jobs in a stollen cab. You toggle it by tapping the horn once and your character contacts dispatch for fairs or dispatch will contact you for fair opportunities automatically over time. The shooting physics are much easier to get used to even without auto aim on. Haven't tried it with any heavy weapons yet. They have the mini gun again and a few other GTA classic weapons.

I wanted the Xbox version, but the friends that would actuallyplay on-line only owned PS3s. So I gave up the achievement love and got the PS3 version.I was hesitant because last year's PS3 version ran at a slower frame rate.I did some quick research and I didn't see reports of any differences this year.Before I called my buddies up, I wanted to try a quick game. I jumped in and started playing like I never stopped playing. The game played almost exactly the same as 3 years ago. I had to get used to the hit stick and such, but it is still pretty much the exact same game. I'm not sure if I liked being good already, or if I wanted more of a learning curve.

In its Star  Trek adventure debut, Activision comes close to reviving a disappointing  genre.  The storyline is strong--stronger perhaps than the movie on which  it's based.  The voice characterization is, no pun intended, engaging.  And  the puzzles, while perhaps easy for hard core adventure gamers, are hard  enough to amuse those of us with busy lives.Where the game fails,  really, is in its graphical quality.  The graphics are hardly better than  designers obviously believed they were doing better work than that early  entrant into the genre, because they keep forcing 'artful' camera angles on  the player, whether she wants them or not.  These constantly-switching  camera angles don't quite make the game unplayable, but they are annoying  enough to waste your time.  Often, you'll lose track of where you are in a  particular room because the cuts from the various camera angles are so  severe, your location is in no way obvious.  In a few rooms the problem is  so acute that you have to move on faith.Don't worry, though.  The  gamemakers have made it largely impossible for your accidental movements to  get you into trouble.  In one especially laughable scene, it's *impossible*  for you to fall off a rail-less bridge, but entirely easy for you to get  gobbled up by an unseen monster.  This, of course, is a significant problem  in a game which otherwise strives for plausibility.WIth these  somewhat glaring design faults hanging over the game, the inevitable  Insurrection.  It does wonderfully amplify that plot.  You should also buy  it if you need to keep abreast of the development of the Star Trek genre.  This is an important stepping stone in that process.  And if you're a young  adventure gamer, still uncertain of whether you like adventure games, this  one will help hone your adventure-playing skills while keeping you in a  familiar environment.But if what you really want is to be immersed in  the Star Trek universe, be surrounded by known characters, and solve  puzzles while galavanting around the galaxy, buy the much superior  &quot;Starfleet Academy&quot; on DVD.

Now that I've played it, I'm glad that they did!  I don't have much to add to the current reviews but leave this review because some people appreciate multiple reviews.  This game is SHORT compared to the newer ND games - I played it in one sitting.  It is also straight-foward, with not a whole lot of places to become confused as to what to do next but still enough variety that you are not on a forced 1-2-3 pattern.  Because it was so short, it didn't have as much dialogue as some of the newer ND games, but it still has good character interaction, which is fairly important to ND games.  This game is also more mystery-focused than puzzle-focused, so ND fans that disliked some of the more puzzle-heavy games like Seven Ships may find this one refreshing.  This game also lacks the ""Nancy must complete other people's work for them"" element that also annoys some gamers - the puzzles that are there are all there for a reason.  It also has an instantaneous travel system between places in the game, which is a good thing, although you really don't need to travel around as much in this game as in some of the others.  This ND game is one of the easiest (if not THE easiest) ND games that I have played.  But none of these things detracted from the fun element of it, which I gave five stars.

McAdams,"[5, 7]","I have been using Logitech mice for gaming for decades, from the most basic models that still used a roller ball back in the 1990s, to the G500, Wireless MX, MX 518, G5, and MX 510. You could say I am a fan.  However, not all of their stuff is wine and roses -- theWireless MXmouse only worked well for me for a while, then developed a double-click problem where even if you slowly and carefully single-clicked, it still registered like you were clicking madly with the mouse -- which made it pretty much useless for general computing, and especially gaming. The wired Logitech mice I have used over the years have always performed very well. I am particularly fond of the G500 series with their weight carriages, and textured grips.So, what's new with the G602? Well, this mode adds a TON of buttons for gaming. There are 8 additional buttons you can map for your games, in addition to the left, center and right click buttons (making 11 total). I have used this new mouse to playCompany of Heroes 2, andStar Wars: The Old Republic(yes, I am still playing that, and you should too ^_^) and it worked fine. I even mapped a few controls to the additional buttons, and they worked fine. The only real problem you're going to have with the additional buttons, is teaching yourself to find them by touch, and remembering what you mapped to them. Also, if you use this mouse for general computing, the button furthest back on your thumb will no longer be the default ""back"" button -- the button that sticks out the furthest is defaulted to ""back.""My major disappointment with this mouse (especially at the price point they are asking for it) is that it requires actual batteries (AAs) instead of being rechargeable (like the Wireless MX is). That is a major bummer for me from an environmental/green point of view, and also from a convenience point of view (nobody likes to buy batteries, and NOBODY likes to have no batteries in the house, and have their mouse die, and not be able to fix it unless they run out for more batteries). I also feel that the 20 dollar difference between this model (the G602) and the model that DOES have rechargeable batteries (the G700s), is a little steep. But, the G700s does come with more buttons, and is a laser-mouse instead of an ""optical"" mouse, and has a higher DPI sampling rate, etc. But frankly, the only difference between the 2 *I* care about, is the battery difference, but your mileage may vary.The G602 includes a switch to toggle between ""full power"" and ""Endurance"" /economy mode, where it uses less battery power. I suggest you put it into that mode and leave it there if you get this mouse. I couldn't detect a difference in the mouse when I used it in that mode, and since you will be feeding this thing batteries, the less power it is using, the better. The mouse has a status LED that will be green when it is in the Endurance mode. It will also tell you when the batteries are getting low (I am assuming that only works with standard batteries, I have a feeling that it wouldn't work with rechargeable AAs -- at least not reliably).The rest of the features of the mouse I pretty much expect from a mouse these days: smooth glide, on-mouse switch to change the mouse DPI settings higher or lower, decent battery life (I have been using mine for over 2 weeks so far, and haven't had to change the batteries yet, so their 250 hour claim is fairly close to accurate based on my experience) and a durable build. I *DO* miss the fast-glide scroll wheel from the Wireless MX and G500 models, though (the G700s has it, but this one doesn't). I don't use that mode of the scroll wheel very often, but when I want it, it is nice to have.Overall, this is a decent wireless gaming mouse. The use of actual batteries instead of rechargeable is a major bummer for me, though, and the loss of the smooth-glide scroll wheel hurts too. I say, if you want a wireless mouse, spend the extra 20 and go for the G700s, otherwise, use a wired mouse like the G500, and avoid having to use real batteries. I would recommend the Wireless MX, expect for the difficulties I stated earlier, but that may have just been the unit I got, so you may want to look into that mouse as well.  Regardless, the G602 is a serviceable mouse, and does a decent job,.4 stars.",4,Logitech is where it is at for gaming mice,1382227200,"10 20, 2013"

I hired it and got up to level 6 when I took it back. I didn't get far because I spent about an hour a day on it because this game is annoying and hard. On the first 5 levels it's hard to use stealth(unlike conflict desert storm), it's not linear, it's just enemies run out write away when going into a new area. You can run out of ammo easily(unlike conflict desert storm 1/2).There are now booby traps in it so because you're in a jungle and there are a lot of plants(it's harder to notice them)you have to hold the left trigger and B to get your comrades to disarm it(you have to always look for them and it slows the pace down).The way you can disarm traps is the way you can get your men to pick up weapons(and more like heal others and use gun turret)instead of doing it your self when switching character.You can only save twice(even on easy), we want as much as we want like PC games. A level can go on for along time because there can be too many enemies in black clothes running around.There're missions or ""primary objectives"" like ""escape"" and ""Bonus objectives"" like ""collect dog tags"" or ""get important documents"". After each level you can build your stats up(Sniping, medic skills...).This is just like the previous games except it's in a jungle(like Metal gear, Splinter Cell 2 and Ghost Recon on Playstation 2...). They could not put a lot of new things in because the other games were so good and it's hard to keep the series fresh. I can tell the developers tried really hard with this game with the graphics but they should have changed how many bad guys are in levels and how much ammo there's. I will rent this again if it's the best game in and I will change the review if it really picks up.PS They should remake the original Conflict Desert Storm with improved graphics and add in the newer features from CD2 and CV.",3,Based on single player,1098921600,"10 28, 2004"

It is possibly the most realistic war game to come out with a lot of historical relevance. The good thing is that it is a good blend of the historical stuff and heroism barely possible to achieve in real life (you need a little of that in every war game).

All true.  But I find people's devotion to Riven and its predecessor  a bit overblown.There are design faults here that should be pointed  out.  The 'slide-show' effect when moving probably does allow sufficient  computer memory for photo-realism while standing still, but it compromises  the realism that the producers were otherwise attempting.  Besides that,  it's simply annoying.  Some have said that it adds a certain elegance to  movement throughout the game, but I don't like seeing my surroundings  'melt' away as I move through them. Nor do I like sterile, empty  environments.  Oh sure, it all adds to the 'creepy' vibe the producers were  hoping for, but a universe which is largely uninhabited is mighty boring  after a few hours.  I wanted wayyyyy more interaction with people than I  got here.I also wanted to understand why I was doing what I was doing.  Oh I could solve the puzzles, given gobs of time and guesswork, but at the  end I found the plot rather too spare for the amount of work invested.  If  I'm going to spend weeks solving puzzles, I better understand more at the  end of the story than at the beginning.  I'm not altogether sure that  happens here.  The universe here, for all of its graphical excellence,  left me hungry for more.  Clearly, this is an entertainment crafted by  fine artists rather than fine writers.  If you're happy with that  orientation, you'll be overjoyed with the final product.

Big Brain Academy fit the bill relatively well--it features a total of 15 games and three difficulty levels that are great to relieve stress, take a quick break from something, or just sit down and enjoy.  The game does, however, have its limitations.The first, and most obvious, drawback to the game is that--well, there are only 15 games available.  While these are enjoyable it doesn't take too long to be craving something more, and I've found that this game plays well for short periods of time but isn't entertaining for more than about twenty to thirty minutes at a time.The inane chatter gets in the way sometimes too--I'd rather just focus on playing the games.  Does anyone really buy these things expecting a storyline or some sort of plot?  There are 3 modes of play--practice, test, and multiplayer--which provides some variety in the gameplay as well.  The test mode selects a game from each of the five categories and gives you an overall ""brain weight""--basically a score you can work on improving--and draws a graph showing which areas you were strongest and weakest in.It's great to have a game like this for a handheld.  Big Brain is great for killing 15 minutes of time in a waiting room or while you're waiting for someone to arrive, etc, but I wouldn't plan on long stretches of entertainment (at least for me).

The positive improvements and added content that I found to be crucial to this game's playability are as follows:1. The weapons work more like the ones of Halo 1 & 2 with much need overhaul for the battle rifle, and pistol (Both of which are much more like their Halo 1 counterparts) as examples.2. A new graphics engine for a series that deserves best graphics for the time.3. The customization of your appearance is now much more extensive.4. NO FLOOD!5. A great story-line that ties into the rest of the Halo trilogy.I admit,  I do have some complaints:1. The slow frame rate which causes lag is very annoying.2.

663,111706,A1OUKEY9UYTV3H,B001COTC3E,"David Allen ""Trust999""","[10, 15]","I've been a gamer now for about 18 years. I've played plenty of games on all types of platforms. I love my PSP as I can take my habit anywhere and get my fix. There have been many games put out for the PSP so far, some really good, and some horrible. Having finished Untold Legends - Brotherhood of The Blade, I was looking for another fun game, but something more current. On searching, I found two games, one of which was Resistance. I always thoroughly read all reviews to get a general feel for the game and what others think about it. I have to say, most got it wrong with this game.On receiving the game, I read through the manual. I was disappointed straight out of the box. The first thing I look for when searching for a game is if the controls are PSP friendly, and that means, that character movement is completely controlled by the analog stick. Most reviews said that is how the character is controlled in this game. Wrong. On reading the manual, I find that only forward and side to side character control is afforded by the analog stick, and to turn the character you have to use the triangle, circle, square, X pads in conjunction with the analog stick. This was exactly what I wanted to avoid because games that are not modified from the two analog stick control format of the PS2 and PS3 suck on the PSP because you don't have enough fingers to both control the character AND select weapons, AND aim, AND fire at the same time. Proper control on land should be totally by analog stick.I gave the game a run for its money. I'll be honest, the graphics and art work are excellent, and the story line is interesting. Sounds and music what little there is are very well done. But as one progresses through the levels it becomes increasingly difficult and then impossible to adequately control the character. This first becomes apparent when you try to swim the first time. You get an indicator to press down arrow to dive. OK, fine he goes under the water then what? You have to move the analog stick forward, but if you need to dive further, you have to press the down arrow again, hard to do when your using that hand to move forward. Turning is a joke as you attempt to use the Square and Circle buttons while pushing the analog stick. Down arrow will get you down under and diving, the up arrow button is all but useless as you die, lost and hopelessly disoriented as you've lost all sense of direction. Just to ice the cake they toss in a few Screachers later to attack you while you drown. Frustrating. The proper control set up for swimming should have been forward movement by analog stick and up, down, left, right by the symbol keys.As you progress you naturally encounter more and more enimies. Most of the earlier enimies are fairly easy, and ammo seems plentiful. Eventually you'll cross paths with an enimie called a Boiler. These lovely creatures look like the aliens you saw in the movie Independence Day. They have thick skin though so you have to shoot them forever to kill them. That uses up all or most of your ammo. The idea is, you shoot them in the head and their head explodes killing them. If you fail to do this, they explode their head of their own accord next to you taking away health. Problem, you cannot maneuver and aim and shoot at the same time because your both hands are having to control the character. You get used to shooting at the same time by pressing the R button, but unless you aim with these guys, be prepared to get blown up. Whoops, cannot aim, using that hand to do two other things, sorry. BOOM! This is a recurring major problem that only gets worse as you play along farther into the game. More enimies, less control, more of you dying instead of them. Half the time your out of ammo, even if you pick most or all of it up that you come across, which is pretty easy to do. Health is usually fairly plentiful, but there are some areas they could have cut you a break and laid one in a corner. There are some campaigns where you don't have any health options, you have to beat the gazillions of enimies overwhelming you or you die first. Again frustrating.Another poor design cue is with the weapons. There are plenty of weapons to use, and you get most of them in the beginning campaigns. Ammo is fairly plentiful, but because of control issues, you waste so much of it, you find yourself defenseless with useless empty weapons most of the time. A real problem is that each gun has different abilities, and dual capabilities. One for example is a regular gun in default mode, but acts as a grenade launcher in the other mode. The problem is, you have to aim the grenade and most of the time your needing to move while doing it. So that means your left hand is on the analog stick and your right hand is on the symbol keys, and they expect you to move, seek cover, and fire using your right button, but if you want to use the alternate weapon mode you have to press the left button, hold it then press the right button. So unless your a danged octopus, your not using the alternate weapons often. The other frustrating thing is, you eventually learn that for example the LAARK has some pretty good power. So you decide to select it, would you not think that a well designed game would display a tiny box or something with the gun name shown as your selecting weapons? Maybe the ability to press a button to refresh you memory as to what the selected weapon can do. Yes, you would expect that, but not in this game. Your on your own, all you get is a small icon, so unless you can recall in the heat of a battle while getting your butt blown off what the LAARK looked like, your SOL and DEAD.In the end this game was nothing but a lesson in total frustration. I did not enjoy playing it at all. Every turn was a struggle to control the character and stay alive only to die because the controls flat out suc'd. Designers of games like this where they are too lazy to change the control functions to PSP friendly should be put out of a job, there is no excuse for that type of poor planning and design. I can fully understand now why this game in spite of all of the glowing reviews was marked down to $14.99, still $14 too high in my opinion.

Think Jeopardy on steroids and interactive.The game is played using the ""buzzers."" The main red button is used for selection of items on the menus and in a couple of the actual quizzes. For the most part, the quizzes require you to push the colored buttons, each button corresponding to an answer on screen.One really fun option you have available is the couch vs couch on-line option. You can play 4 people at your house and 4 people at someone else's house anywhere that Buzz Quiz TV is being played by someone who is connected to the Internet. It is a nice addition to the game.There are 5000+ questions included (so the manual and game box says). The best part about this? When you run out of 5000+ questions that are built into the game, you can jump on-line and download user created quizzes, so essentially you have a game that has the potential to be upgraded endlessly. When I was connected to the Internet I believe the currently available downloadable user created quizzes was just under 8000. That's a lot of extra quizzes to use (I'm not saying these quizzes will be as good as the originals, but they are there for expandibility).I played with 2 other people and we all had a good time playing. The questions aren't terribly difficult and a general knowledge is a bonus. On-line in couch vs couch has proven to be fun as well, if not a little awkward at first.The buzzers are relatively cheap feeling. They don't feel like they will break on you, but they don't have a high quality feeling either. Also, realize that each wireless buzzer requires 2 AA batteries that are NOT included in the box.One aggravating part for me is the manual. Here you have these new controllers and nowhere in the game manual do they explain how to set them up; they just assume you'll know or as it says in the manual, you are directed to look at the manual for the devices. The ""device manual"" was NOT in my box. Thankfully I am electronics savvy and it was simple to figure out, but for some of the more technically challenged, this lack of device manual could be quite a set back.If your box doesn't come with a manual for setting them up, all you need to do is:1) Install batteries into every Buzzer you wish to use2) Power on Buzzers using switch on the right hand side (assuming you are looking at the top of the Buzzer; the side with all the buttons)3) locate the USB stick included in the box4) pull the cap that covers the USB connector off the stick5) insert USB stick into any open connector (should be on the front of the PS3, below the disc slot)6) power up the system7) Insert game discOther than the lack of manual, I am pretty happy this game. The only real caveat is one of single play. If you are buying this game for single player, do yourself and DON'T. The single player game, while essentially the same as the multiplayer, lacks the type of fun required for the $60 investment. If you want to play alone, wait for the price to drop to $30 or less as otherwise I don't think you'll enjoy it enough to justify the cost.

I guess I don't watch cartoon network, as I have heard of absolutely none of these characters, but I decided to try it out anyway.It's very much obviously a rip-off of Mario Kart, yet lacks in the fun you can have in that game with both in-game fun and mini-game fun. There are 4 or maybe 5 events, each with about 4 tracks to race on. You get a selection of Cartoon Network characters to choose from, with a heap to unlock later. Each car has it's own attributes and abilities, and probably special power ups, but I found this game to be one of those highly annoying games where its the karts you unlock later that go faster then the ones you have to put up with at first.The tracks are much like a Mario Kart race... from circuits, beaches, deserts and schools etc to race on. The handling is decent once you get used to it, it's a standard racing game, one button to accelerate, one to brake, and one to use your power up item when you run into a block on the track. There is also a button to slide, but it's not for sliding (drifting) around corners, it's more a mostly useless button that you only need to make a sharp turn into an object or a quick slide to prevent hitting a wall, however, if you are used to Mario Karts slide, then don't bother trying it, you will just turn into a wall if you do.The power-ups are identical to Mario Kart. Boosters, projectiles and things to leave on the track like mines and oil spills and what not. The whole thing is a watered down rip off of Mario Kart, and it was decent enough to be slightly fun at first, but it becomes completely annoying after a while when you are cruising along in first place, and every few seconds an opponent behind you has projectiles something at you... you see a warning icon, which I couldn't figure out why it would bother, as you can't defend it unless you have a temporary shield power up to activate... but I got so sick and tired of seeing that warning icon, then a stupid whistle sound as it collides into you and you tumble around in the air and land back on the track to resume racing... even tho it does not slow you down all that much and you can continue on with ease in first place... it was just irritating for it to keep happening every few seconds.It's also one of those games where you have to collect things on the track to earn tokens to unlock things... these things are upgrades, mini games, new character/vehicles and some cartoons to watch... but whats annoying is some cost a ridicules amount... you can earn probably 1000 or so tokens for each championship... but to unlock the ""Black Sheep"" cartoon to watch, it will cost you 250,000... can any one really be bothered playing the game for that long to earn that many points/tokens/coins?I can tell you now, if you want to see what you would get by wasting all that time unlocking everything, then when you enter your name for the game, type in ""GIMMIE"" and everything will be unlocked, but you will not be able to save any progress this was. This opens everything for you to see, and you can see the rest of the characters to unlock might get faster and better to use, but the mini games are a snore fest and the cartoons are a nice addition, as they are short, but full length episodes... but as I said, I don't watch Cartoon Network, so they did not appeal to me, but for someone who LOVES the shows, then unlocking 3 of them to watch without just imputing that GIMMIE name code, then you may be wrapped to be awarded with that feature to be unlocked.Overall; it just become too repetitive, and more annoying as it went along. I just did not care to complete the whole game... if you own Mario Kart, you will see this is a major attempt to try and clone it, but it gets it all wrong in the end. Even tho the graphics aren't all that bad, and the controls are decent, there was just so much more that was needed to improve this game. If the price is right and your kids love Cartoon Network, then it might be a decent buy for them, but I can tell you now, it will get old quickly.",2,"Looks promising, but becomes nothing but annoying.",1296432000,"01 31, 2011"

I am a FPS-er because of lack of time but I really love games like Fallout & Stalker that let you build your character and tweak resource in a manner that might not have been the original intent...I am only a little way into the game (the reason for that is because I keep replay the beginning over and over because I never read the directions and I 'thought' I knew this game.  I thought this was a just run and smash game.  Then I learned to can get companions to help you one your way (reset and start over trying to save more people), then I learned you get to build stuff (restart again), then I learned there is map mode that shows a LOT more content to the game.. and that is where I am at...SO LEARN TO USE THE MAP right away and save yourself a lot of missed opportunities.

Being a HUGE fan of the TV show (i've seen every episode live, as it aired for all 4 seasons thus far) I was looking forward to this game like no other. The game as a whole let me down though. First things first... The game is very short. I beat it in one day with only 2 breaks inbetween sessions. There are 7 levels, or episodes as they call them and each episode takes anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes to beat depending how long you linger around and talk to people. Which brings me to the second point.. The voice actors. They have a few real cast members doing the voices (Claire, Desmond, Sun, Ben, Tom, Mikhail) but everyone else is a stand in. Some are actually decent (Jack, Hurley, Kate) and some just do an awful job (Locke, Sawyer, Charlie). In any case, its rather disappointing because the game would have been so much more likable if it had all the real actors in it. Oh well... I guess ubisoft didn't want to pay them what they wanted probably. Back to the game.. Most levels are either running from the smoke monster or trying to figure out fuse box puzzles.. Which both can be rather frusterating. I'd say the coolest part of the game is the flashback scenes where you actually get to walk around and try to take the perfect picture to regain your memory of the situation. I thought it was a pretty unique idea. But in the end, the game is rather dull and short.

Sometimes the monsters aren't even on screen in the movies for more than 50% of film. Well, you don't have to worry about that with the video game. Godzilla: Save The Earth is all out monster battle!Most of your favorite monsters are here for you to choose from. Hardly any are missing. In fact, I must have lost touch with some of the later Godzilla movie releases, because the game introduced me to some new monsters. You get to pick whichever monster you want to be, then you go to battle against your most popular foes.You can pick and battle against any of the following: Godzilla 1990s (but not burning Godzilla), Godzilla 2000, SpaceGodzilla, MechaGodzilla 2, MechaGodzilla 3, King Ghidora, Mecha-King Ghidora, Gigan, Mothra (larva or moth), Rodan, Anguirus, Megalon, Megaguirus & Destroyah; and the ones that I'd never seen in the movies: Orga, Moguera, Baragon & some Power Ranger looking thing called Jet Jaguar.You control as a third person all of your monster's actions. Each monster has unique moves and abilities that take some practice to master with different controller commands.Most of the monsters need to be unlocked through successful gameplay before they are available. If memory serves me correctly, The Godzillas, Anguirus & Megalon are the only ones unlocked from the beginning. Only gameplay in single player Action Mode will earn points that can be used to unlock monsters and/or arenas in ""the store"".The arenas are: Tokyo, Osaka, Monster Island, Seattle (the previous four being the only ones unlocked from the beginning), New York, San Francisco, London, Boston, Los Angeles, the Asteroid Belt, the Mothership and a Boxing Ring.There's also a 2-player mode (Versus), an up to 4-player mode (Melee), and a couple of practice modes (Challenge & Survival). You can also set up Godzilla: Save The Earth for online play, which I have not done.Why this game has a T rating is beyond me! My 5 year old loves this game, and he has made sushi out me in Versus and Melee modes. So if you're a parent who is contemplating getting this game for a Godzilla-loving pre-teen, I'd say there's nothing here that will warp you kid's little mind.The graphics are the only downfall to this game; they are extremely cartoonish.

Bayonetta is a story about the titular witch that's the last of her clan and whose lost her memory and she's trying to get it back. The story is nothing spectacular, but it serves it's purpose, which is to move onto the action. Bayonetta's action is over the top and off the wall, with Bayonetta possessing wicked combos and magical attacks, it may seem very hectic at first, but once you pick up and play it, you'll find yourself in the flow of battle, attacking and dodging with grace and power. For a game that's all about combo attacks, it also has a defensive side, which is the dodge move. The dodge can be preformed at any time during any combo and even in mid air, and dodging at the right moment rewards you with ""Witch Time"", a more or less bullet time effect, which slows down time, giving you an edge in battle. Along the course of the game you'll fight basic cannon fodder followed by bosses, but as the game progresses, enemies that were once bosses will jump into the fray as regular enemies, sometimes paired up with another. Bayonetta can be hard at times, but fun and rewarding, it runs smoothly on the Playstation 3, despite people saying it frequently chugs and lags, the loading can be a pain sometimes, but it doesn't hurt the experience.

Their support was not helpful.  It is a fun futuristic-Civilization-like game, but the DRM scheme punishes the player.

7817,114440,A11JVRGUM4KIMB,B001ENPDJA,Matt,"[10, 12]","If you are curious how this keypad compares to the Xbox 360'sChatpad, keep reading as I will be basing most of my review on comparing the two, even though each is for a specific system.Both were great ideas, but somehow the PS3 keypad falls short of the Chatpad in nearly every department. The most important being the location...who decided that the keypad had to be on ""top"" of the controller? Whoever it was made the biggest mistake for such a device. I suppose it's possible that the attachment simply wouldn't have functioned properly or been comfortable located on the bottom, but I believe that it could have been done. This alone is reason enough not to buy this if you can use a USB keyboard instead. In my case, this isn't really an option. The bottom line here is that it's simply not comfortable to type on at any point. Most people will have to adjust their grip on the controller in order to use the keypad, which is not something they should have to do. It's almost better to keep the keypad unattached from the controller and use it as a separate device. Ultimately, I suppose there was some big reason why they had to make it for the top of the controller - if not, this was a HUGE oversight.Aside from that major flaw, the keypad attaches to the controller well and looks pretty good for what it is. It doesn't add much weight and allows easy access to all buttons and ports you would have without it. The ""pass-through"" buttons (ie: the PS button on the keypad simply presses the PS button on the controller) feel a little cheap and somewhat uncomfortable, in my opinion - the original Start and Select buttons are rubbery, while the ones on the keypad are plastic. They are also raised higher for obvious reasons, which means you'll need to adjust what you've been used to since the PSX. Also, I think a nice layer of rubber between the pass-through buttons and the 'real' ones would help to make them feel more ""solid,"" if that makes sense.So PS3 keypad location = top of controller; 360 Chatpad = bottom of controller. I think anyone who has used both will agree that the Chatpad is much more convenient to access quickly and more comfortable overall.Another big thing the Chatpad did right was have backlighting for the keys. I didn't really think this would be a big deal, but I find that I'm usually playing games in dim lighting, so the off-white lettering on black plastic makes it near impossible to see what you're typing in such lighting conditions. Obviously, this makes it near useless, unless you're just good at typing on such a device. Since I don't do that much typing on the PS3, I have yet to get comfortable enough with typing that I don't have to look at what I'm doing.So PS3 keypad = no key backlighting; 360 Chatpad = backlit keys. A seemingly simple feature becomes a huge oversight for the keypad.The touchpad, while a neat idea, is near useless. I only tried it for a few moments in the browser and, since you're running your finger over the buttons, the cursor just kind of jumps around everywhere - it's not easy to make it move in any kind of a straight line. If you've ever had a piece of hair stuck on the underside of a optical mouse, think of it kind of like that, though the cursor doesn't skip around quite as much. I suppose it might be good for someone who can't get used to browsing with the analog sticks, but I doubt I'll ever use it again.So PS3 keypad = touchpad; 360 Chatpad = no touchpad or anything like it. This doesn't really make Chatpad ""better"" or the Keypad ""worse"" but I doubt many people will use it for long - it's simply a failed feature. How much production costs could be save by removing this feature? Could we have had backlighting instead? The world may never know.In the end, it's not a bad accessory to have. However, I believe the retail price to be way too much - especially when compared to the 360's Chatpad, which is almost half the price. If you can find a good deal on this, go for it, but heed the consistent cons throughout these reviews and decide how important they are to you. My wager would be that if you've never used the Chatpad, you might be okay with most of the cons here. If you have, however, prepared to be very disappointed, especially when you compare what you paid for your chatpad to what you'll pay for this.If I could do it over again, I'd research the third party keypads more.Pros:Attaches snugly to the controllerLightweightLooks goodCons:Location relative to controllerNo key backlightingTouchpad doesn't accomplish muchDifficult to use in-gameRequires separate charging",2,Don't pay full price,1287273600,"10 17, 2010"

My eight year old looks forward to playing this every weekend.And I know it makes me a curmudgeon, but I just expect more.  Yes, the puzzles and games are a little different, and yes, in addition to all the old figures and giants, we can now use ""swap force"" figures that can trade tops (attacks) and bottoms (charges).  And yes, they've added a jump button, which makes some levels feel like a watered down version of a Mario game.  Lastly on the good points, the figures still look GREAT.I appreciate that Activision is doing a lot with an outdated system like the Wii, but at the end of the day, I want more.  When I get a new Zelda game or Mario game, I expect to see something I've never seen before, to be surprised and impressed several times per game.  Here, it felt like more level grinding.  Also, I'm tired of buying more figures.  I know that if I don't get enough swap force combinations, there will be places I can't go, but after three of these games, I'm OK with that.I don't want to be unfair - I think hardcore Skylander fans and many younger players will like this a lot.  Recommended if you or someone you know fits one of those categories.-----------------One more thing - after 5 or 6 levels, we started hitting the dreaded ""freeze glitch.""  We could play the level all the way to the battle with Baron von Crab, but at the end of the fight, the Wii would freeze and only a full powerdown would break out of it.  After searching for a while, here are the suggestions we tried.1) Update system:  I haven't heard of this helping anyone with the glitch, but it's the first suggestion I found, so I did it before step 2 below.  Didn't seem to help.2) Disable internet:  I cleared all of the internet settings so that the Wii couldn't reach the internet while playing.  I don't think that helped, and it's annoying to have to reenter them, but it definitely helped some people on the forums.3) Make sure you have at least 1500 free blocks in memory:  .

7684,143333,AGQK3MKEUH5FV,B002I0KOSI,Brendan Ross,"[5, 8]","BioShock Infinite is the third installment in the series of games which began with 2007's much-acclaimed BioShock.  While the game has some similarities to the earlier games of the series, Infinite is quite different in other areas which are sure to make some fans rankle.  Overall I found it an entertaining, if somewhat flawed game.  To explain why, I will start with the ""cons"", since that seems to be what most people are interested in when reading reviews, and then I will follow with what I think worked rather well in Infinite.SPOILERS!  -- THERE WILL BE SPOILERS HERE -- DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE EXPOSED TO SPOILERS! -- SPOILERS!CONS:1.  Combat System.  The combat system has been substantially simplified in many areas.First, the player is limited to carrying only two weapons.  This appears intended to require more tradeoffs to be made by the player, but can feel like an irritating limitation as compared with the previous games.  It can also discourage upgrading too many weapons, because the player will most likely have one ""keeper"" weapon and one ""off"" weapon using this system, which tends to make the game play very similarly over the course of the game.Second, the setting of the game features mostly wide open areas, unlike the cramped conditions of Rapture from the earlier games.  This makes the gameplay much easier as a practical matter, and much more typical of a generic shooter type game.Third, the game lacks truly challenging enemies like the first two games had.  No enemy here is really like a Big Daddy in difficulty or challenge, and even the tougher enemies (patriots, handymen, firemen, ravens) are really not very tough to beat in terms of requiring significant tactical thought and adjustment.2.  Linear design.  Unlike the earlier games, where the player could move around the entire map freely, exploring or collecting resources and the like, Infinite is a linear experience where the player progresses through areas that are then closed.  These can be reloaded from a chapter menu, but that is simply ""replaying a zone"" -- it isn't exploring a city organically as was the case with the earlier games.  This serves the narrative, but tends to make Infinite feel more ""gamey"" than the earlier titles in a forced way.3.  Story Problems.  SPOIILER!-- SPOILER! -- SPOILER!  Here there will be a lot of disagreement among the playerbase.The storyline essentially revolves around Ken Levine's narrative gloss on the theoretical physics theory of the multiverse.  Some players will find this irritatingly similar to films like Inception, and others will just find it confusing.The issue I have with it is that it kind of plays lip service to some of these theoretical physics ideas (multiverse theory), and makes various hand-waves at quantum physics throughout the game (some of which are bound to go over most players' heads, but that's a separate problem), but then violates these ideas in substantial and problematic ways without explanation.  For example, it is a known time travel paradox that one cannot travel back in time because doing so will compromise one's contemporary existence -- this is even more the case where one is going back in time to kill oneself, or precisely to allow oneself to be killed, by one's offspring --> this is an impossible paradox, because if you kill yourself at an earlier period, you would never exist to come back in time and kill yourself to begin with.  It's a paradoxical loop, which is one reason why physicists have been skeptical of time-travel.  Now, time-travel is fine in a setting where the plot is fantasia and soft and so on, but if you are throwing in references to quantum mechanics and string theory and so on throughout the game, playing fast and loose with some of the ideas feels, well, snarky.A similar issue is raised with respect to the entire treatment of multiple universes in the game.  The multiverse theory, which is more speculation than hard science anyway but is still a theory floated by theoretical physicists, posits that there are infinite universes.  This means that, in theory, there are infinite versions of you, and infinite possibilities for how your life plays out in an infinite number of universes.  The game's name itself is a reference to this theory.  But the multiverse theory also implies that no *one* universe is dispositive of what happens in the others -- there is no ""core reality"" from which the rest of the possibilities emerge.  There is simply an infinite number of parallel realities.  This is problematic for the game, where clearly the suggestion is that the drowning of the player's character in the game dispositively removes all instances of the game's main antagonist in all possible universes -- something which doesn't make sense per the actual theory of the multiverse.  Instead, the ""game's theory"" appears to be that there is a core reality which is determinitive of other possibilities -- which is a nice theory, but it isn't the multiverse, and it isn't explained in the game, either.  Now, I realize that this is a video game and not a physics textbook, and that therefore the narrative should be more important than the science.  That's true.  But, again, if it's just a case of ""making stuff up"" in a nice way to serve a narrative purpose, then the game ought not do so much hand-waving and term dropping from *actual* quantum physics -- this just comes across as intellectually snarky.Clearly the game and its ending were designed to cause controversy, and thereby generate attention.  That has been a success.  Upon further review, however, the ending becomes more problematic, even if taken from a purely narrative point of view.  Paradoxes are fine, but raising *known* paradoxes and not addressing them at all feels ... sloppy.4.  No Manual Saves.  I realize that this is a point of contention in the player community, some of which seems convinced that the ability to save anywhere outside combat is game breaking.  However, the problem with Infinite is that the automatic save points are very spread out.  It's not uncommon for a player who likes to explore to lose 15-30 minutes of game time if they need to quit the game on short notice -- as is not uncommon for people who are fairly busy.  This is a very unfortunate design for a game like this one, and really should be changed in a patch.PROS:1.  Fun game world.  As noted above, this isn't Rapture, it's Columbia.  Rapture probably had more personality, and was certainly creepier, while Columbia is airier and more subservient to the overall narrative.  Columbia here is a backdrop, whereas Rapture was a character.  But ... it's an entertaining backdrop and filled with fun details.2.  Interesting switch-back themes.  While it was thought prior to Infinite's release that the game would mostly be a pointed criticism of right-wing American mytholog(ies), in reality it is more the case that the game whipsaws themes around in an interesting way.  Thus while it's true that the initial portrayal of Columbia as a racist, fundamentalist bubble that worships the founders of the US is an easy and over the top take on something most people already see as false, this theme is not a main one in the game.  In subsequent chapters the game takes the freedom fighters (whom the player probably identifies as ""good guys"" as compared with the racist fundamentalists of the game's early chapters) and turns them into vicious violent killers which it explicitly says are just as bad as the racists.  This challenges assumptions which the player had probably already internalized about them by then, which creates discomfort -- that is well done.  The game also portrays the scientist couple -- which one would ""normally"" see as the foil to the fundamentalist zealots -- and makes them morally ambiguous at best, portraying them as almost amoral and more or less powerless to stop, if not downright helping, the fundamentalists.  And, finally, the game takes the female character, Elizabeth, and kind of toys with whether she will be a love interest for the player character before revealing that she, or a previous version of her, was his daughter (in this or another universe, apparently), which, again, challenges assumptions.  The way that these themes cascade to challenge assumptions is fairly well done in the plotting.3.  Some fun fight sequences, like the rail fights (which are not spectacular by any means, but fun) helped make the combat, which is overall fairly lackluster, a bit more interesting at times.=======Summary (TL;DR):Infinite is a good, but not great, game characterized by a good narrative which nevertheless plays fast and loose with theoretical physics and average shooter style combat which is occasionally livened up in a few sequences.  It's fun to play and I found it enjoyable, but I think that the ""it's the best game ever!"" type of breathless reviews it is is getting miss the mark by overlooking some aspects of the game that are less than stellar or simply problematic.",4,An entertaining but imperfect ride,1364774400,"04 1, 2013"

8942,70932,ALT8OCGC2LVQ9,B000FRVCAA,Paul Mosier,"[18, 20]","Being the only simulation racing game on the Xbox 360 and the closest thing to GT4 since 2004 it is going to be difficult to compare this game to anything currently played. Because of this I will compare it to the game it is quite obviously trying to steal fans from. Forza 2 is unique from any other racing game currently on the 360 simply because it is well executed. It has most of the features of GT4 and none of the problems that franchise had.The actual racing is very simplistic in its approach. Making the car drive how you want it to is not, especially at the higher levels. At the beginning you can win without tuning the car hardly at all. Go and drive fast and you'll most likely win...on the standard difficulty setting. The difficulty setting unlike the driving is fairly complex and adds another dimension to the game. One is able to toggle on and off the traction control, ABS system and active stability management. Difficulty of the opponents is adjustable three ways. Also available is a suggested driving line which tells when to brake, let off the brake or hit the accelerator. This is adjustable as well. I really like this feature because it really eases you into the racing instead of making you take those ridiculous license tests from GT. Everyone remembers these; they are frustrating and time consuming. What prevents you from getting to the higher level races in Forza is your driver level which you level up by winning the purses from the races.The graphics in Forza 2 are average at best. The cars look very dimensionally correct but everything just has that game feel to it. Not once would you confuse this for reality. In fact I'd say it is only about one step up from GT4 in graphics. With the capability of these 7th generation systems you should be able to create a real sense of awe. What most likely happened is spending so much time making sure the dimensions of the car were incredibly detailed they ran out of time to really enhance the visual aspects of the metal and the backgrounds. It is almost like the lines are too sharp to make it seem real. This is quite a dissapointment for a game that took five years to create. I can only say that racing simulation games have to be the most time consuming expensive type of game to produce. What other type of game do you have to purchase the rights of 300 different products, numerous tracks and make them mesh together. For true gamers that are concerned with the essence of the game, the graphics will be an afterthought. I have to admit, I wouldn't mind having an HD version of Forza 2 in the future.Cars in Forza 2 are literally the crowning achievement of the game. You will have a difficult time finding two cars that drive the same. Much like real life this is true. I, myself have not driven anywhere near the caliber or number of cars on this game. However common sense says: the 1969 Camaro is going to have a considerable amount of over-steer, the AWD vehicles have amazing grip, the Elise handles like a go-cart and the Lamborghinis as always are faster than the speed of light. You would expect this type of behavior in most racing sim games, but in Forza 2 every single car has a signature driving style, engine sound, braking ability and overall feel. In fact mechanical and aerodynamic engineers were hired to make sure the physics were correct to real life.A big step that Forza 2 took was having real damage on the vehicles. This can be adjusted for the level of damage you want. Cosmetic-gives only cosmetic damage and no mechanical or electrical parts can be damaged. Partial Damage-body and suspension can be damaged and the car may pull to one side as well as reduced braking performance. Simulation-full blown damage as close to real life as it gets. Here you can damage the body, suspension parts and even lose power in the engine and transmission.  However, if needed you can go to the pit area and all the damage except cosmetic can be fixed. This step of realism really adds another dimension to the game. Bravo.Customization is a very large part of the experience in Forza 2. My favorite feature is the fact that you don't have to pay to change the color and there are about 150 regular colors, 150 metallic colors and probably 50 special iridescent colors. You are able to add hundred of vinyl shapes in any color and any size. Body kits and spoilers which actually improve the cars ability are able to be purchased and even adjusted. Mechanical parts on the car that can be upgraded are:  brakes, all suspension components, plugs, intake, super or turbochargers, complete engine swaps, tires, wheels, engine, ignition, transmission and a few other things. You get the point. All the things that really were annoying with GT4 were remedied. Also upgrade parts can be resold back for half price.Another amazing aspect of the game is the sheer amount of information available. I really enjoy this because while not being quite as technical in scope as GT4 it doesn't inundate you a lot of esoteric specs. I say available because you are not forced into viewing all of it all the time, but it can be accessed. A really nice feature is the ""benchmark"" which gives you various datum on the car you are currently in before you drive it. This includes 0-60 times, 60-0 times, skid pad, top speed etc. When purchasing a car you can find out horsepower, torque, weight etc. Detailed information on the car more so that this can be found as well. While racing you are able to view advanced telemetry such as lateral and vertical g's, tire heat, vehicle damage, engine and transmission running characteristics, shock damping amounts as well as a few other things. Later on in the game this technical information will really help out in determining how to tune your car. Tuning in Forza 2 is very close to GT4 in that the same things can be adjusted here. The difference here is when parts are adjusted it is much more noticeable, especially when combining multiple parts to be tuned. For example, when two or three parts are adjusted you get a synergistic effect. There isn't really much else to say about the tuning - a necessary part of a racing sim.Understandably the game is not perfect. First off the load times are amazingly long for a system that has four processors-probably 30 seconds on average. Along with that is the time it take just to get to a race from starting up the Xbox. It is at the very least 60 seconds if you have the car you are going to drive ready. I'd say you'd be closer to two full minutes just to get into a race. Once you reach the upper levels of the game you notice one serious downside - the tracks. What I mean is the selection of tracks really goes down from fifteen or twenty to basically five. You have Mugello, Laguna Seca, Silverstone, Suzuka and  The Nurburgring. These are all really interesting and real circuits. However, when you've raced them literally 30-40 times previously it ruins the experience. The game becomes monotonous. There are fake/synthetic tracks if you will that I find to be pretty exciting to drive including the King Cobra. The King Cobra is an amalgamation of hairpin turns, zig-zags and just downright malicious driving conditions. There must be four times the number of turns in this track as in any other track other than the Nurburgring. My belated point is for some reason the Forza programmers felt these fake tracks unfit for the professional races. Bad idea in my opinion. The only other real problem I had with the game is that there were not any F1 or open wheel cars in the game. I cannot fault them too heavily however because I imagine the rights to the other 300 vehicles were expensive enough to get. The driving conditions also never change. These faults are fairly easy to overlook if you really love racing sims however.Graphics 5/10Features 10/10Gameplay 10/10Difficulty 5/10 (on default settings)Music 5/10 just a bunch of rave musicReplay Value 7/10Overall 8/10",4,"Well Done, Gran Turismo has Serious Competition",1188518400,"08 31, 2007"

(how many DnD games can they make... and I am sick of the dungeons and the hobbits and the space creatures and the BIG SHIPS ... tired old stuff)This game is a radicle departure from all of that.  You still create a character but the similarities stop there... you can pick different things as you go up in levels but you also get to modify and redo them... like at lvl 24 you go on a respec mission, and once you finish it (and you will have to team up to do it) you can redo what you have done up to that point.. if you didn't like something you can delete it and choose something else.... so you are not locked into something.Teamwork is of the essence.  Lots of the times in other role playing games I felt like I really didn't need a team of people, or I felt too imprisoned in the way the game wanted me to team up or the way the game locked me into something once I teamed up... this game you can team up just to roam the streets to beat bad guys up... or you can team up and accept a mission to beat bad guys up -and when you accept a mission and complete it, you get far more xp points than just beating up bad guys on the street.....the types of teams.. I play a lvl 25 tanker, and there are four or five OFF THE BAT types that I play with to make my tanker better.. I like to find a defender, a blaster... all these different types of team members do vastly different things in the group... some heal, and some fight... some can mind control enemies.... so, if you spend time finding different people to play with, and refining your skills as a player and logistics of battle, you can make some very good teams.The game allows you to keep a list of friends... so when you sign off, you can see when your friend comes on line as well.  So, you can team up again.the game is very open ended.. has stores where you can get enhancements to your skills.. you have to buy things, and you get 'money' or influence by getting xp doing missions or etc... or you can go on ebay and buy the influence and have it traded to you.

Before I get to the technical issues, I think it is best to start with the general game design. Call of Cthulu tries to be three things: a)A horror game b)an FPS, and c) a puzzle game.As a horror game it is a disappointing mixed bag. It can create a frightening, unsettling atmosphere; it can create a couple of gotcha pop-up scares, but it can't really scare you in the more basic and fundamental way that Amnesia, Doom 3, F.E.A.R., or Silent Hill could. Most of time it just creates a sense of danger on the horizon that never really gets to you in the precise way that you'd want it to be materialized. Actually there is one part early in the game where the player's worst fear does become materialized, but this is never repeated for the rest of the game.As an FPS, it is both viscerally bloody and twitchy and not only that but your character moves SO SLOW! I think this game probably has the slowest base run speed every implemented in a FPS game. Your ""run"" is really a walk. Also, your character can jump, but 99% of the time he cannot make jumps that normal people would be able to make. This is frustrating at times.The other aspects of the game were only partially broken, but the puzzle aspect of this game is the first of the elements that are truly broken. All the puzzles in this game are completely counter-intuitive and are impossible to solve without a strategy guide. Even the lock puzzles are needlessly difficult. A game in my opinion is a failure if it requires a strategy guide in order to be beaten.And probably the number one reason why this game sucks is because it has NUMEROUS glitches most of which have not been patched formally. There is one chapter in this game ""A Dangerous Voyage"" that is completely glitched and broken. And on the forums, these glitches are pretty much impassible on modern computers. Certain mission critical lights won't show up, certain scene transitions crash the game, etc. The AI doesn't move correctly. This chapter failed game testing in every single possible way. I can't believe this game even made it to retail or they even put it up for download with such numerous glitches most of which are fatal.

It also doesn't eat an entire memory card like NFL 2K--just a little over half of one.The bad news, though, is that there are some INCREDIBLY big problems with gameplay.  Number one: FIELDING FIELDING FIELDING.  The worst are grounders through the &quot;gap&quot; between first and second.  The first baseman is apparently unable to move even three feet to his right in order to snag the ball.  Ugly.Number two: baserunning. How many major-leaguers have *you* seen running on an infield popup with less than two out?  Play this game at all, and you'll see guys who get paid more than the GNP of some small countries making that very same bonehead move.  The player has to physically remind his baserunners to return to base on a pop-fly.These two very large problems are enough to really take a lot of the enjoyment out of what would otherwise be a very good game.There are some other problems, too: the little graphic that shows where the ball (tiny white pixel), defensive players (tiny blue pixels) and runners (tiny yellow pixel that is nearly indistinguishable from the ball) is almost completely useless. The fans in the stands look like something out of a Nintendo 64 game. There's no way to skip past the incredibly awful renditions of the national anthem at the beginning of each game. The replays aren't very interesting. The commentary is wooden and nowhere near as well-done as in, say, one of the excellent NFL games. The controls are not always very intuitive or responsive (especially irritating when you're frantically pressing B to get your idiot baserunners to return to base while they blithely jog along, finally realizing that Oh! You want them to DO something!).  These are all pretty petty little quibbles, really, and none of them would be enough to really make this a bad game by themselves, but when combined with the fielding and baserunning problems, the annoyances just mount and mount until you want to chuck your controller at the TV.(Barely) worth the $15 I spent on it used--for the graphics and to tide me over until WSB2K2 comes out in a couple of weeks.",2,Could be worse... but not a whole lot.,994896000,"07 12, 2001"

After playing it for a year, having left once and come back, I am reluctantly leaving it again.  The problem that Warhammer has been unable to resolve is player number imbalances on the servers.  I've played on two servers and they both have the same problem, way more players playing the Destruction ""bad guys"" than playing for Order.  Although I don't know the actual numbers, the Order players are so outnumbered that they have practically no chance of winning in the core ""open RvR"", PvP fighting.  Two nights this week I was unable to find any open RvR action because all the Order player had simply left. Most of the time, Order will try to get a warband going for PvP, and will immediately be run over by Destruction warbands with twice as many players.  I believe the problem is self perpetuating because new players and existing Order players will start Destruction characters to be on the winning side, making the imbalances worse.  I've played a Destruction character also, and it got boring fast also when there is no opposition.  If the trend continues, and it does appear to be getting worse, soon all the players will be on one side only.  Good PvP combat should depend on teamwork and skill, not just having more fighters than the other side.This is a serious flaw in what could have been a very good game.

9231,147039,ACMJY1ED8ZIYJ,B002V1PTO8,Kevin J. Redmond,"[2, 5]","I have been a fan of Star Trek for many years now, and the first thing I think of when I think of Star Trek Online is... ""Where's the Trek?!""  It certainly doesn't feel very much like Star Trek, even if it looks like it.  Some have even complained about the proliferate non-canon ships at end-game, but that is neither here nor there.  The excuse of war is used to make a game that is all about shooting something and destroying it.  There is no real diplomacy, there is no real discovery.  Fly in, shoot it up, then warp out.  Even in times of war that is not the policy of the Federation.  I don't think Captain Picard, Sisko, or Janeway would intentionally blow up a base that houses Jem'Hadar babies.  In Star Trek Online -- you will.Warp is another reason this doesn't feel like Star Trek.  You warp around at impulse speeds in the ""Sector Map"".  This is nothing more than an attempt to make the game feel larger by increasing travel time... but in the end it only succeeds at reminding you just how small the game is.  Space has been sliced up, and placed into small neatly-packed instances... complete with border walls (remember the plasma walls in City of Heroes... well, take away the plasma and put a sign up instead that says ""next zone over is *zone name*"").  The other problem with sector space, and the fundamental design of the entire game, is it adds more load screens.  Let's say you're starting out at Earth (Sol) Space Dock, and you have a mission to head to a planet in the Regulus Sector Block to investigate a situation:  first you leave the station (load screen), then you warp to sector space (load screen), then you spend 5-15 minutes flying through sector space to the Regulus border (load screen), then you spend another 5 or so minutes flying to the system that houses the planet you need (load screen), then you finally warp in to, usually, only see one planet... and proceed with blowing up the problem, and exit the system (load screen).  Luckily, you can hail starfleet and report back in without wasting time going back to Sol.  The point is -- the game has entirely too many load screens.  Even such minor transitions as entering Quark's bar on Ds9 require, you guessed it, a load screen.If you were hoping to knock your opponents shields down, then beam over to their ship and phaser-stun their crew to win a fight... you will be disappointed.  The bridge is only there to serve as fluff... it has no function whatsoever.  You won't spend any time actually aboard your ship, instead you will pilot it from a 3rd person perspective at all times.Ground combat is lankey and a complete mess.  NPC's appear to have no AI whatsoever and stumble on their own feet, as well as having surprising difficulty getting through a door big enough to fly a type 5 shuttle through.  Most of the time you just want the ground missions to end quickly so that you can get back to space fighting.While space combat is fun at first, it doesn't take long to become tedious.  All of the missions are basically copy/paste scenarios.  Even the episode content gets highly repetitive.  You might enjoy the game for awhile, but for most people it won't take long for boredom to set in.  Once it does, don't expect it to lift. There is also no death penalty whatsoever, which makes space combat even more tedious.  There is no risk, and so you're just going through the motions without even thinking about it. Just like Champions Online this game could have been something truly remarkable, but the small-scale design just doesn't allow that to happen.  There is a reason Cryptic can pump out games so quickly with their new engine -- because it doesn't require much content at all.  The illusion doesn't last, and you soon realize that what you are playing is more akin to arena net than MMO.The one saving grace, besides the well-constructed graphics and good artwork, is the pvp.  If you play Klingons that's all the game will offer you, as they have no PvE content to speak of yet.  The PvP can be quite entertaining and rewarding, however.  The problem is that it becomes just as much of a rinse/repeat exercise as the PvE content does.  Playing Klingon makes this resonate even more, since it is the grind that gains you levels.  It is also what makes the game feel more like arena net than MMO... the PvP has no more depth than a console game would.  Even while playing Federation and going back and forth between PvE and PvP... eventually you will realize that you are doing the same five or six missions over and over and over.  The objective for all of them: shoot to kill (and occasionally hit ""F"" five times on the glowing objects on a barren world).The one thing they did right was character customization.  But with Cryptic, at this point, that is pretty much a foregone conclusion.  If you are looking for casual gameplay and just some space-shooting then you will likely enjoy this game.  If you are looking for something that is a true realization of the Trek franchise in an immersive and expansive MMO environment... expect to be let down dramatically.  I would easily say this game is worth an initial $50 investment.  I have gotten as much enjoyable game time as I might with any console game in a similar price range.  The $15 monthly fee, on the other hand, doesn't quite seem worth it to me.",2,Another small-scale game from Cryptic...,1268179200,"03 10, 2010"

You get grabbed by some team of cliche people.  The hot head who smarts off all the time, the girl who automatically defends you when criticism comes up, and the ethnic leader of the RESISTANCE.  There were times where I actually laughed at the stupid voice overs in the cut scenes.MULTIPLAYER:  This sums up the whole multiplayer experience: ""THE RICH GET RICHER"".  The whole battle point system is so stupid.  Everyone just camps and hides so they can rack up points and then they get health boosts as well.  So you've got a guy that is harder to kill, hiding in a house, racking up points.  Then he calls in a chopper that DOMINATES the entire map.  Spawn?  Killed by chopper.  Spawn and run.  Killed by chopper.  There is only one anti-chopper weapon in the game and the little drone is so hard to get out and aim at the chopper you might as well try to lead the chopper with an RPG.  Basically it is a camp fest that ends in a godlike chopper reigning down fury on everyone as they spawn.Probably the worst FPS I have ever played.

I've beaten or at least accomplished a lot on many racing games. I am very good. This game however is even too hard for me. The difficulty level is insane. The tracks are full of right angle turns, tricky s curves, hard to miss traffic, and drivers you compete against that are absoutely brutal. The sponsor races are near impossible for anybody without driving skill nearing that of godly.I was warned before I bought this game that it can make people who never get mad at games extremely enraged. I was even shown a photo of what somebody did to a PS2 controller. However, I just figured that was those people's character fault and got this game anyway with the mindset I would not give into getting mad. Well, after trying 15 or so times to beat the SAME race I was so angry that I started smashing the controller over my head as hard as I could! And what I did to myself after that to relive the extreme stress I am probably not allowed to talk about on here so I will leave it out. But I really hurt myself and it left me emotionally scarred. For like two weeks after I stopped playing the game I was extremely short fused with people and freaking out and SCREAMING AND YELLING AND BREAKING THINGS every time some little thing went wrong in my life.

After the install and boot up, I was not dissapoionted. The graphics, sound and overall feel of the game were spectacular. I loaded into online, where I am admittedly terrible and had a fantastic lag free experience.I pulled it out and went through the other launch titles I purchased. When some friends arrived to check out the PS4, BF4 was the easy choice. And then the crashing began. At first I thought it was the PS4 (having heard of some peoples issues and my unfamiliarity with the system). It continued to crash over and over. Since Friday, I have not been able to log more than 15-20 minutes without the crash. After some homework, I discovered that BF4 is broken or near broken across all platforms. This has made what looks to be an amazing game a dust collector.Unfortunately, 1 star is all I can give. I paid full retail for a broken product.

I have a good computer which I've tried to build specifically for gaming and first person shooters. I have all the requirements that should make this game run perfectly, but I am still experiencing some lag. The game is so intense, however, that I am able to forget about the slight glitches except when they become so bad that I must restart the game. When the game is at its best, it's phenomenal. It is the closest thing to real combat that has been released thus far. I've played realistic games and games such as Halflife where one shot doesn't kill, and I appreciate both styles of first-person shooter. If you're more preferential to the Halflife-style game where you can take a rocket to the chest and not die, then don't buy this game because one shot almost always kills. The game rewards you for success by unlocking more specialists as you continue, and awarding your outstanding performances with combat medals and ribbons. I thought that this was the most unique aspect of the game, as well as the combat points that can enhance each of your characters. This game is awesome and truly amazing. It would be perfect if not for the above-mentioned glitches. Don't let that fool you though, you need to experience this game to call yourself a fan of the first-person shooter genre.

But the excuse this year is that the roster included is ""legends"" from the old days of WWF (yes, WWF, not WWE, children).The only really questionable ""legends"" additions are Hunter Hearst Helmsley, though his inclusion would likely be due to boning the boss's daughter.  Using the name ""Legends of WRESTLEMANIA"" allows the game to stay WWF focused and not go all-out in offering us WCW talent and ECW talent.Instead we get the well-known likes of Hulk Hogan, Ultimate Warrior, Rowdy Roddy Piper, Jake the Snake Roberts, Junk Yard Dog, Iron Sheik, Ric Flair, Rick Rude, Michael Hayes, Mr Perfect, Ted DiBiase, The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart.People can argue and complain all they want about who made the roster and who didn't; ultimately it doesn't matter because the game is terrible.For some inexplicable reason, the sticks on the Xbox360 controller are done away with, and all the controls for punching and grappling are now centered just on the buttons.  Even to buttom-mash to get up involves hitting just these buttons.If this was designed to make the game more ""approachable"" to more ""casual fans"" who may have played old wrestling games on the N64, then it implies that they think the ""casual fan"" is too old (or re; stupid) to learn the Smackdown vs Raw controls, and need something familiar to their old days.The problem is that these controls do not even mirror the control scheme of N64 wrestling games.But worst of all comes QUICK TIME EVENTS!  Now it's less of a wrestling game and more of a PPV with added Simon Says feature (just like Indigo Prophecy).  The quick-time event completely ruins the fluidity of play, and the shame of that is that it includes chain wrestling and multi-step events in wrestling that are very much impossible in Smackdown vs Raw 2009.Collision detection is terrible in this game, arguably worse than even in Smackdown vs Raw.  I've had to deal with playing as Steve Austin vs The Rock, and trying to punch The Rock only for him to lightly fidget, moving his shoulder near me, or taking a half-step back, and so despite my fist clipping through his body, it doesn't register as a hit because the Rock moved too much.Then there's a slight bit of historical re-writing.  Keeping true to McMahon's love for muscly men, most of the legends here have been ""embellished"" in their physical build.For example one comes the Iron Sheik.  Viewing pictures of him in his old days, he's rather thick, but with some smooth natural musculature to his chest, but still thick around the center, like a fat/muscular guy.  The Iron Sheik in-game has an upper body build of someone like Dave Batista.And then comes the end-game mechanics!  Reminiscent of TNA's abortion video game, this game seems to favor finishing moves over anything else, really.  You have to work hard to fill a series of momentum bars, which increase your attack and damage and overall endurance.  You become more powerful and stronger.  Making a taunt causes some loss in momentum though.HOWEVER, once you pull your finisher, your momentum is completely gone.  Back down to zero.  So you go from being THE IMMORTAL HULK HOGAN to the BROOKLYN BRAWLER counting the lights.Kicking out of pins is equally a pain from TNA iMPACT!, and yet the computer doesn't seem to have the same troubles you do.Basically, the game becomes an easy rental once you conclude that you can pretty much beat everyone with punches and kicks, a finisher, and a hard pin.Nostalgia is a nice factor, but you cannot play nostalgia.  You cannot eat nostalgia.  You cannot spend 50 dollars for nostalgia baked in crap.",1,Smackdown vs Raw 1990!,1238025600,"03 26, 2009"

Kaplan,"[17, 29]","I don't usually comment about other reviews but the other customer scores here are far, far too generous... which is to be expected on a much-hyped game's first day of release.  Resistance: Burning Skies is not ""2 out of 10""-bad (reference there to Jim Sterling's panning of the game over at Destructoid), but it's certainly not what I would call a good way to spend $40.Here's where I'm coming from in terms of the Resistance series:  I bought R:Fall of Man way, way back when the PS3 first came out ($600 backwards-compatible PS3 unit, may you rest in peace after your untimely YLOD!) and had a pretty good time with it.  It was lengthy, the level design was sturdy enough, it was challenging, and Insomniac put in some decent reasons to come back to it.  It may not have the most sterling reputation 5+ years later, but it was polished and atmospheric for its time.  Resistance 2, well... I thought it was okay.  The graphics were a little rough and the game felt too sporadic in its movement from location to location, but it was fun in places.  Retribution on the PSP (by Sony Bend, the great studio behind the PSP Syphon Filter games and Uncharted GA for Vita) was a stunning revelation for the little handheld, matching great graphics with a strong story, an abundance of terrific secrets, and some very diverse gameplay.Finally, there's Resistance 3, which I consider to be not just one of the finest FPSs on the Playstation 3, but one of the finest FPSs to be released, period, since Half-Life 2 came out in 2004.  Insomniac hit their stride with fun multiplayer, a terrific campaign, and plenty of polish.I mention all of this because, well, imagine my disappointment now that I've spent the last six hours breezing through Resistance: Burning Skies by Nihilistic (their previous work, PlayStation Move Heroes, should have been my first clue).  Look, even if you come into this game telling yourself any twin-stick FPS on a handheld is an impressive feat, even if you set the bar impossibly low, even if you don't care about Resistance as a series, you are probably going to be disappointed by half of this $40 package.Let's start with the story:  There isn't really any.  All you know is that there have been rumblings about mutants in Europe and you're a fire fighter in New York.  It takes all of thirty seconds for the Chimera to pop up (in burning wreckage, no less), and so begins a mess in which you play a rather vague, nondescript firefighter (the only thing to remind you of this is your melee weapon, a fireman's axe) who for some reason keeps getting sidetracked on his way over to meet his family in a nearby refugee camp in New Jersey.  There's nothing really sprawling or epic about what happens; you move from bland city location to bland warehouse location to bland cyber lab and so on.  The voice acting is fine; the game's Alyx Vance-like companion, Ellie, is adequate; and the story even musters a genuinely nice moment very late in the game.  Unfortunately, 99% of the game is spent wandering narrow corridors with zero set pieces thrown in, so you quickly forget what your ""character"" is supposedly doing.""Who cares about story in vidja games?!"" you may retort.  Okay, well, let's move on to the nitty-gritty.  The graphics are a mixed bag.  Some of it (bosses, enemy textures up close, some ally expressions, tunnel sections) looks terrific, some of it looks awful (city street textures, enemy animations, graphical glitches galore).  The sound is perfunctory and at times grating (the chaingun, for instance, cuts out intermittently).  The music sounds good when it's present, which it hardly ever is (most of the game is played in relative silence).The absolute worst thing, though, is the level design.  Even by R1 standards--the standards of five years ago--this is bad level design.  Again, there are no interesting set pieces, only a few minor teases.  For example, you spend all of five minutes on a giant enemy's back only to spend an additional second or two killing him in the easiest way possible.  A water tower looks like it's about to fall on you... only to to be conveniently stopped by invisible walls.  A bridge is getting fire-bombed... but none of it ever collapses.  And so on.  It's all promise, no delivery.And this wouldn't be a half-bad homage to the simplistic FPSs of yesteryear (think Painkiller) if the game didn't scream ""UNPOLISHED.""  From the numerous graphical and sound glitches to the extremely short campaign and a final boss whose ""patterns"" and ""strategy"" border on nonsensical, it becomes evident that Nihilistic was probably planning much more than Sony would ever let them deliver given the Vita's strict launch timeline.  This game may have been pretty decent had it received an extra year in the can.What's worse, your interest in this game should begin and end with the single player game.  I know, I know, what about the multiplayer?  Well, here's the thing: Even if you end up enjoying the multiplayer in the game (and you just might, if you happen to get into a game), you're not going to be there for long.  Resistance 3 had what I would consider to be pretty darn good multiplayer and while Burning Skies is a step up from the cut-and-dry online deathmatch in Resistance: Retribution for PSP, it is so barebones as to be an ugly cousin to R3's multi suite.  And even then, R3's multi had you leveling so quickly, it didn't keep a community around for long.  In Burning Skies, you ""level"" that much faster and see everything there is to see, perks-wise, in the campaign.  Imagine, then, how few people are going to be playing this game in a month or so from now (and subtract 100,000 from your estimate, because you may have forgotten that the Vita hasn't sold too well in the US).In other words, you may be initially excited to play competent FPS multiplayer on the go, but after that wears off, you'll be reminded that everything is pared down for the sake of squeezing ultra-simple multiplayer into an otherwise rushed and incomplete game.Really, the best I can say for Resistance: Burning Skies is that a lot of it is merely adequate and it controls decently (if your thumbs can take extended rounds with the Vita's rather short analog sticks).  But I hope you don't really decide to spend $40 on ""adequate"" with a heaping side of ""rushed to market.""  Rent this or wait for the price to come down to $15-20.  Even then, you may be disappointed.  Personally, I'd return it, but I bought it at Best Buy (wah wah waaah).And if you're still really aching for a FPS to take advantage of the Vita, go back to playing the far superior Uncharted: GA and Unit 13.  Squint enough, and you might forget you're playing 3rd-person shooters.",2,"There's a reason the game's subtitle is ""B.S.""",1338336000,"05 30, 2012"

The best label for the gameplay is a cocktail that blends Pilotwings with Gran Turismo's license tests: Hurtling along preset paths, you must guide a vehicle through a precise series of jumps, swerves, and other hair-raising maneuvers. The requirements for success are unforgiving and demanding; if you lag behind even slightly or deviate from the path in the smallest way, it's stunt over, and you have to start again from the beginning (apparently, the directors of these films don't edit). As a result, this game is truly very hard, and the absence of difficulty levels or even checkpoints means no mercy for less-hardcore gamers looking for a break. Basically, Stuntman is about being perfect-and incessantly repeating a stunt until, at long last, you get it exactly right. Adding to the frustration, the game's physics sometimes feel wrong: Your car will often wreck in goofy, weird ways; fences that break in some places are impenetrable barriers in others; and the like.  If all that doesn't turn you off, bump the Fun Factor up to 4.0 because Stuntman deserves major props for its unique concept and thrilling stunts. The buzz of jumping a car over a moving train, whipping it past exploding gas stations, and then burning nitro to soar over a river just can't be denied. When you complete all the stunts for a film, you're rewarded with the trailer, which is a series of cinematics spliced with the stunts you performed-and that's just way cool. The game also supplies an awesome stunt constructor, which lets you create the craziest set of ramps, barriers, and obstacles you can conjure up, then attempt to survive it in the cars you've unlocked. Instead of that mode, though, what Stuntman badly needs is a practice mode where you could take your time and master the stunts. After all, don't real-life stuntman get to practice-or at least get a peek at a map-before the cameras roll? In the absence of those aids, your frustration will rapidly boil over as you struggle more to learn than to execute. In a delicious bit of irony, at one point a cinematic tells you that supercomputers have been used to model the precise speed you should hit a jump...but that speed is never revealed to you!  If you're the sort who likes to crack a tough nut, Stuntman has a pair cast in titanium. It's definitely not for everyone, but for the right gamer who can tolerate its flaws and appreciate its rigorous challenges, it's gold.

I picked up this game hoping to refresh my memory and writing skills.One thing non-beginners should know, the max level you can start at is 11, which is still rather elementary, so if you have intermediate or advanced knowledge and are using this game as a refresher, you have to plow through many levels (can only advance one at a time after getting the required points by playing mini-games) before you get to a level that might do you any good by introducing any new vocabulary. I scored perfectly all starter questions and could only start at level 11. It was well past level 20 before I found any new words.That said, this game is helping me how I expected it to. It's reintroducing me to having to write in hiragana/katakana and giving me new words to learn.As mentioned by previous reviewers, the stroke order and/or number on several hiragana/katakana are OFF! This is really annoying as I keep getting marked that I wrote incorrectly by the game and have to relearn to write certain characters in game style - which is just wrong, and makes my writing look sloppy. If you learned to write properly by taking a beginning Japanese course elsewhere, you will have to adjust to continue with this game (if you insist on writing the *real* way every time, you'll never get enough points to move on).I would suggest if you are serious about learning Japanese, begin by learning the stroke method elsewhere - either in an actual class or by book, online, etc... don't depend on this game to teach you that correctly.

It has a few games that are spoofed to the best of their abilities.  And not only that, but the games are very well designed, fun and keep all the old school conventions that made them so good when they were first released.  For anyone who loved the original Nintendo days... this game is a huge treat.Retro Game Challenge is just that... a challenge.  The overall story may seem a little ridiculous to many people.  You meet this guru who is a great gamer and he decides to send you back in time to play old classics of 80's.  You must conquer his challenges in order to get back to your own time.  And some of these games are indeed, challenging.You'll start with something simple.  A game called Cosmic Gate which is more or less Galaga.  And it plays just like Galaga did.  While it may seem straight forward at first, in these games you are actually given specific tasks to undertake.  It's more than just performing well, it's achieving specific goals before you can go on to the next game.  It keeps things from being completely straightforward.  When you complete the challenges for a certain game, you'll be able to unlock it to play whenever you want.There are other games to behold as well.  Such as a game that spoofs platformers, racers and there's even a spoof of the RPGs you played in the 80's like Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy.  There are a lot of clever spoofs.  And you'll also notice that you'll play sequels and special editions.Even more than there, there are more homages to gaming in the 80's.  There are games here that actually have cheat codes and there's even a sort of magazine that allows you to read tips for the game you're playing.  It's quite unique and interesting.It is no surprise that all of these games look and play exactly like their counterparts of the 80's.  So you are getting 8-bit style graphics and even the flicker and glitches the games in this era had.  It's done very well, but without actually being too cheap.  As you might also imagine, the games here are hard.  Because games on the original NES often were.  The music is also 8-bit sounding and you might even find typos within the games.  In terms of recreating a gaming experience from the 80's Retro Game Challenge works well.  You almost expect this to be a re-release of a bunch of classic games.The only thing which may be a little annoying is what happens on the bottom screen.  It's a great mechanic that you can see you and a friend watching the game being played, but you can only take him cheering you on for so long.  Another thing that might not settle well with some is that the ""sequels"" and ""special editions"" don't really add a whole lot of new things.  On the other hand, it's a very small complaint.If you enjoyed the NES era in gaming, then Retro Gaming Challenge may be the perfect game for you.  If you began after this era, it may be harder to really appreciate the appeal of this game.",5,Precious Memories,1234310400,"02 11, 2009"

(I reviewed Madden 13 also) First let me say that Madden has got to be the most passionatly reviewed game due to the love of football in this country. With that said, onto the review. I generally add 1 star to any Madden game because I do not play online so I don't have those unique problems with lag and such. One thing I noticed is that the graphics look worse than 13. Don't know why but gameplay is the main thing anyway so I can live with this. Franchise is back and owner mode in franchise is an absolute blast. So far I'm having fun with this mode. As you all know Madden 13 stripped down many franchise features that pissed off everybody but like I said, I play offline against the CPU so I did not experience those kind of issues. I was hoping that the passing and running games were as good as Madden 13 and to my suprise thay were, so I'm very happy about that. I had to play around with the viewing presentation cause it was way too far out and made it hard to see my guys downfield. The option to change the view is not in your franchise mode. You have to back all the way out to settings on the main screen and there are 4-5 choices. So I had to dick around with the different views to find the one I used in Madden 13 which was perfect. The zoomed mode is OK but I just could not get used to the kicker at field level view on punts and kickoffs. It was just too strange looking for my liking. I think I went with the standard view which looked similar to Madden 13. They also have wide view, and legacy and maybe another. So once you change the view then you go back into your franchise and the game will start with the view you last changed to. As far as complaints I have read here this is my take.The speed of the game can be changed. I have seen only on a few occasions that the play looked like it was running in slo-mo. Also I have read that fast wideouts were being caught from behind by slower defenders. This can also be changed in the sliders. I have my difference set at 25. Use this feature IT WORKS!. Use the sliders people just like someone else had mentioned. If the AI offense is killing you, then turn up your pass coverage in sliders. I have found that the last few Maddens, the slider set is a constant adjustment to achieve the results that you want. I have the CPU sliders set way higher than mine cause I want to be challenged. This year the sliders have a great influence as compared to any other Madden I have played. Just minute adjustments can be seen immediately. Also on a final note: I have had no trouble getting pressure on the QB. You need to audible to the correct defensive play. Enjoy this game cause It's a good one. I was thinking that if this one was radically changed from the gameplay of 13, I would shelf it and go back to 13, but that is not going to happen and that makes me very happy.One final thing to say: I loved the 2K series of football as much as anyone but the last 2 Maddens have surpassed it and it's in the dust now. Can we have that burial at sea now for the 2K football games?.",4,Whats all the fuss about?. Here we go again,1377648000,"08 28, 2013"
12187,141147,A14CH8L7LPBN8A,B002I0JBL4,matt,"[1, 2]","Let's face it - this game has been hyped for a long, long time - so it did start out with some pretty big shoes to fill.  It fails miserably in my opinion.I was a huge Duke Nukem fan back in college when it first came out.  My friends and I spent hours in front of our old 486 laughing our heads off at the over the top violence, crazy one liners and overall entertainment.  You never knew what was next - there was just nothing like it before.Fast forward to this new one - it opens with you having to bumble around a building attempting to get to a tv studio.  This is your first taste of how terrible the graphics are - the characters you bump into have no life to them and the graphics are good by 1st generation xbox or playstation 2 standards.  Seems the started the game for those previous gen systems and never bothered to sharpen them up.Within a few minutes, you'll be able to walk into a bathroom, open a stall door, and pick up/throw feces.  It just felt like the creators of the game knew Duke Nukem needed shock value - heck the original was full of it.  But the game forces it - its like it can't quite be funny or shocking, so it just tries to make you think it is funny or shocking.  It loses the lighthearted feel of the first, and just comes across as a pathetic attempt to get cheap laughs.Shortly after, you get to fight a pretty huge guy in a football field and punt his head through the goal posts when you beat him.  Sounds like a great setup, but by that point, I was so bored I barely cracked a smile.  The boss fight itself showed just how inaccurate the aiming system is - I found it very jerky, and very difficult to aim exactly where you want.  On the PS3, it doesn't even close to the precise movements that a mouse would give you on a PC, or that the XBox 360 controller would give you on Halo or Call of Duty.I read a lot of reviews saying this was a disappointment so I bought it used from Gamefly for $8.99.

11893,138965,A22V8NP045YXZV,B002I0J4NE,ryan-o-,"[5, 9]","I purchased the Playstation Move bundle with Sports Champions mainly due to the positive reviews I have read for it. This is actually the second next generation motion gaming product I bought, the other being the Kinect for Xbox 360 which we had problems with. I was hoping this would offer a superior experience to that and also to the Wii but this is not the case at all.First I would like to mention the positive aspects of the device. Setup was a breeze, you simply plug in the camera and connect a USB cable so your PS3 registers with the Move controller. Compared to the Wii, the PS3 obviously has much more power behind it so you can play motion games with HD visuals. I had no problems playing in my living room's lighting conditions.I have owned a Wii since it came out in 2006 and I can safely say that if you own both a PS3 and a Wii there is no reason to purchase the Move. At this point the game library is very small and the experience is too similar so it is almost like a double dip and you'll wind up with all these accessories lying around your house. I would only recommend this to a PS3 owner that has no interest in the Wii and would like to try motion gaming.The largest problem I had with Move is it's precision - It is true, the device is very precise. But the precision is its major downfall because it is just TOO precise. Do not shrug that off as if it were a good thing, it's not. Humans are not precise, we have flaws. We are not robots or computers. Without going into detail, I read about what makes the Move different from the Wii remote and yes it uses more advanced technology but ultimately this technology is used to accomplish the same thing as the Wii. Having said that, the precision is not because of the camera tracking and it is probably something that the Wii is capable of if they wanted it to be. There is just a reason why the Wii is not as precise - it's probably tuned to a comfortable level and going past that would make it frustrating to use.Playing the Sports games was frustrating. The slightest movement translated to unintended results. Real life ping pong is not as difficult or precise as the Sports Champions version. I read others make similar complaints and all the responses to them said that the game is just more realistic, it takes practice to master, give it time and you'll get use to it, etc. But the ignorance in such statements irritate me. It's asking you to get used to the device's flaws. The characters are boring and generic looking, you cannot use anything like Miis or Avatars here either. Having to perform calibration between games really takes you out of the experience too and it very annoying after a while. You don't see this mentioned in the reviews for some reason. The games are more realistic than their Wii Sports Resort counterparts but that is not a good thing especially if you were to play this with friends over. They'd prefer the Wii version hands down.Another frustrating aspect with the precision occurred in Time Crisis Razing Storm. The Wii pointer proved to be successful as a control method for light gun games and one would think the same would be true for the Move. It's not. Again, the precision, it makes these shooting games exercises in frustration that they shouldn't be and it proves that despite the gun accessories available to clip the controller into that the Move is NOT a good controller for light gun games ,not at all. There are plenty of negative reviews to back me up. Another situation you would think would be a no-brainer was Tiger Woods 11. To be fair the game was not initially designed for Move, it was patched in. The problem comes in the way you have to use the Move as a navigation tool in the game to set up your shots. Again, the ""too precise"" totally kills it and the Wii is just a more comfortable place to be.Regarding the controller itself, I bought a navigation controller which is the Move's 'nunchuk'. What I didn't realize is that unlike the nunchuk it is not motion sensitive at all. In order to play some games to their fullest such as archery in Sports Champions, you need two Move controllers because of this. You can only use up to 4 Move devices at a time too, meaning if you use two Move controllers and two navigation controllers you can't connect any more. Luckily, it seems most games do not require the navigation controller and you can use your normal PS3 controller as a substitute anyways. Either way, the navigation controller is more or less a useless buy.The controller is comfortable to hold, but the light up orb is ridiculous looking. Aesthetics matter to the vast majority of people out there, and this is not going to win any beauty contests even if it does change colors. The PS eye camera you need to use is also not aesthetically pleasing and you're going to want to remove it from your TV when not playing. An almost-invisible sensor bar it is not. Although it may sound super nitpicky to mention this, the box art is hideous. The be fair, this affects most of the Playstation products - they appear to be using the same box designers as they do for their electronics. Box art can translate to sales in video games, just ask the guy who drew the original Mega Man US box art! (it was notoriously bad and despite the game being good, it did not do well until the sequels)I did not experience anything that the Wii can already do (and do better) despite all the reviews I read. I did experience quite a noticeable lag on the Move, nothing bad but definitely not there on the Wii which is something else I didn't read about in reviews. I realize this is the internet and a a small handful of fans can create false reviews if they want to although I'm not sure why the tech sites and game journalists scored it better than Kinect and gave it good reviews.I read about what this can do that the Wii with motion plus cannot - it can be used for augmented reality purposes. I'm personally not interested in this but somebody might be. The other thing I have been reading is that the glowing orb allows it to be seen in 3D space which is something the Wii only does in pointer mode. This was definitely not put to use in any of the games that I tried and actually IS something the Wii can do. Wii games (especially motion plus ones) often have you point toward the screen before playing a game, something comparable to and less intrusive than the Move's constant calibration. From there it can calculate where it is in 3D space. This and having to place a motion plus controller face down are methods used to make the Wii controller accurate. The Move apparently has a compass and an extra axis internally to help it do the same thing but I wouldn't consider it to be more accurate.In the end, from a tech standpoint the Move is newer and it is superior but all that tech seems to help it do the same exact thing as the Wii with only little promise of doing more which doesn't personally excite me (augmented reality). It is more precise than the Wii remote is and as I mentioned, that is not a good thing and is the major downfall of Move. I can't recommend this at all and find it very hard to believe the majority of these reviews are real. I strongly suggest trying this out before purchasing and DO search for and read the negative reviews if you can find them. Many of them say the same things that I have just said. I was able to return the bundle with no problem because it is considered a peripheral and even got BB to take back the Time Crisis game at the same time, but your results might vary. The Wii is an established and much less expensive safe investment as I do not see a future for the Move and recommend you definitely spend your money elsewhere.",2,How can there be so many positive reviews?,1294531200,"01 9, 2011"

The developer's put forth a concerted effort to make this franchise more commercially viable with Conviction.Now Splinter Cell purest's have mostly criticized this installment for basically being dumbed down for mass appeal. I do sympathize with their point of view, and to some extent their constructive criticism is valid.However, the revamped gameplay provides far more depth in my opinion. What was once an unapologetically conventional stealth experince, has now become a tactical 3rd person shooter/stealth hybrid. These new mechanics are visceral, and fluid in execution. The player can storm an enemy location with guns a'blazin like John Rambo. Or, remain quietly in the shawdows, identifying ambush points, and striking with deadly precision, all while remaining undetected. This freedom of choice provides a more engaging and balanced gaming experience.Naturally, with the new TPS mechanics, the stealth aspects have been scaled down a bit. You can no longer drag enemies, or chose between kill or takedown. Also, whistling and throwing objects are a thing of the past too. However, the newly implemented ""mark and execute"" feature compensates rather nicely, and serves as an adequate replacement for the previously mentioned removed features.People do seem rather disheartened that the single player campaign is uncharacteristically short. But to be honest, there is so much replay value in Deniable Op's that the shortened length of the campaign mode really just seems like an afterthought to me. Plus, there is a co-op campaign that is even more enjoyable. That coupled with single player story provides a decent amount of playing time, probably around 10-12 hours combined.Conviction may disappoint the stealth enthusaist, but will undoubtedly reward the casual gamer looking for a fun stealth/action hybrid.

Having just come off great games like Call of Duty 4, Assassin's creed, Bioshock, Mass Effect (you get the idea..) ... I was fairly disappointed by how unintuitive the controls of this game are. They aren't the worst, by far, but certainly felt sloppy in light of other better games I have recently played. The control sensitivity is too low on ""medium"" and felt much better on ""high"" except when I went to aim with ""Iron Sights"" then medium was better, constantly changing got annoying though, so I decided to melee exclusively (see below) Moreover, the graphics are cartoony, the checkpoints are few and far between, and the weapons... this takes me into a second paragraph.Combat: Explain this to me: Nazi bad guy with sub machine gun is perfectly accurate at 1000ft. I manage to take him down with the only good weapon in the game (bolt action rifle) and when I get his machine gun, I can't hit a guy 30ft away. I don't get that.  Regardless other than rifles, the weapons aren't even worth it. I found myself running up to guys for melee combat instead of wasting my time shooting them. Of course, I have to wait for the enemy to finish whatever animation he is in before the melee prompt appears, but it was far more effective than shooting. I found myself quite irritated by the combat.Other things that annoy me are the dumbing down of vehicles battles. Enemy tank, no problem there is a rocket launcher conveniently stowed around the corner. Boat? Ohh... another rocket launcher... blimp? Same. I did not come across one combat encounter with an enemy vehicle that didn't either drive off in a hurry, or didn't blow up with a couple well aimed rockets. It was all very formulaic. To wrap it up, the game sacrificed game play for story, and is overall at best a 3 star game.Edit 3/2/08: There weren't many multi-player games going on, but I managed to play a few. What I found was, the levels were boring. You get to pick your weapon each time you spawn, but they are as bad in multi-player as they are in the single player campaign.

I was never into first person shooters, but then i got addicted to multiplayer and well,... here i am.And still not a fanatic on the actual multiplayer setup, i always thought it was first seen first killed mentality with no real strategy or fun involved, unless your the rapist raping these young fools online, which most of us arent. Then i found zombies... my true love when it comes to activision and trey arch.. they took a peice of what looked to be a beta testing and turned it into a very popular game, and if theyre smart they can actually create one full seperate game in the future because of this. But now to the review, i just wanted to clear up why i actually play this game... percentages - Story 0% / Multiplayer 20%/ Zombies 80%...Last night (11/13/2012) was the first time i played this game and i started with zombies... They had a major glitch in ""town"".. it would not load up and ""ready up"" any of the players, all it would say ""waiting for more players to balance teams"" even though we had a full lobby of 8 players. SO i did not get to play town.My zombies experience so far has been excellent to say the least. Grief is very fun in a way that you have many upon many of options to choose from when it comes to playing this level... The farm IS TINYYYYYYY!!!! It is very close quarters to there is little room for error when you get past level 10. But all in all, grief is amazingly fun, you can work with all 8 players and try to get as far as possible or you and your roadies can gameplan against them and set them up for an early victory, say all opposing players die in a round, ONE player from the living team must stay alive till the end of the round for that team to win.

I too wanted to play all night but im not 17 anymore and i NEED sleep instead of want it.Multiplayer - My initial reaction was very slow and jerky. Almost a soft lag w/o actually having lag. I played 7 rounds, many varieties of games and got to create a class, just so everyone knows where i am at. It is for the most part the same old game as black ops just upgraded sound effects and controller vibrations. THe maps look to me, the same as black ops just slightly altered and different points of interest. Still circles and run and gun, no real thoughts on the mapping on treyarchs part. SO therefore, multiplayer gets BORING quickly and will stay boring. The perks are the only addition that makes this worthwhile, you can choose to have a double perk (I.E. lightweight and flack jacket, not sure if thats correct but the point is, you can choose two perks in the same category only as long as you subtract another perk, as like an attatchment or main perk (scavenger)). .sounds confusing but its a very simple concept.... to me its worth the money just because of zombies.. i was blown aaway by the farm and didnt even get to play the other two yet, yet play survival ...Graphics - 8/10Gameplay - 7/10Fun (whole game) - 5/10Zombies - 9.5/10No creative genius for so much hype just like MW3 - Priceless.And thats why it gets 2 stars...

4754,126563,AHNHLGKIZ2N3B,B0028ZNX68,"D. R. Jeanclerc ""Reader, Listener & Obsessive...","[11, 18]","DJ Hero is the latest in Activision's rhythm game offerings.  What started out with players strumming on guitars morphed into singers singing, drummers drumming, and now this.  But unfortunately, what should have been a revitalization of the genre and a new entry in the party game hall of fame falls short in several ways.THE GAMEBuilding off of the Guitar Hero model, you play along with a club mash-up track, trying to keep up with the on-screen instructions as they roll past.  The group with whom I played were equal part intrigued and intimidated by the turntable controller - everyone wanted to try, but quickly got frustrated at how unnatural it felt.  Face it - most of us have had momentary fits of air guitaring or drumming, but not so many have had that for DJing.Players combine crossfading tracks, dropping sound effects, and scratching to play the songs.  Most players were mainly interested in the scratching, but it was disappointing for two reasons:  first, it's difficult because of the controller's size/design (more on that later), and second, it's also very basic at the same time.  The scratch motion is just back and forth with no regard for speed, distance, or anything else that makes each scratch unique.  Ultimately, it's no more interesting than hitting a button on-time and it didn't take long for players to realize it.  I found crossfading to be the most rewarding and interesting part of the gameplay, but most others found it to be too difficult.Another issue is the mixes themselves.  Each one is a mash-up of two tracks and you're supposed to creatively reassemble together.  Interesting yes, but that means that the target tracks are necessarily unfamiliar to everybody.  Think about it this way - when you play Guitar Hero, what's more fun?  Playing some song you've never heard before, or a longtime favorite?  Exactly.  At one point someone commented that you can barely even tell if you're doing well or not because your ears don't know what the end result is supposed to sound like.If the unfamiliarity of the source material was a given, then why not allow more freedom for the player?  Unlike Guitar Hero and Rock Band games, where players are given opportunities to solo freestyle for stretches, there are no such creative opportunities here.  Why not let players decide how to mash these tracks together or even post their own track combinations, similar to how players can upload their own musical compositions via Guitar Hero 5?  This is a big miss that ultimately dooms the game to being more of a chore than party.There is multiplayer built in via DJ + Guitar mode, where one person works the turntable while another plays the familiar guitar hero role.  This seemed like a last-minute add-on, and possibly even a concession that there will probably be more people who want to play the familiar and fun guitar instead of the turntable at your party.THE CONTROLLERThe DJ Hero controller uses one free-spinning turntable and a crossfade bar along with a few extra buttons for Euphoria (like Star Power in GH games) and sound effect/sample drops.  The turntable itself is small, closer to a 7"" single than a full-size record.  This unfortunately makes it difficult to scratch, especially when using the right-hand source - that button is so close the spindle that it's difficult to move the turntable back and forth from that position.  A larger turntable would have solved this issue.Also, I don't see why the turntable is free-spinning to begin with.  Since there are no speed-based elements programmed into the game (i.e. it reads a slow scratching motion identically to a fast one), there's no reason for that range of movement.  It would actually have been easier to control if it sprung back to a center position like the strum bar on a Guitar Hero controller does.  More than a few times, our test group lost the buttons when they spun away after a scratch.Finally, unlike Guitar Hero, there is no option to flip the controls and/or the screen for left-handers.  Even some of the right-handers who tried it found that the controller was too cramped with one hand on the crossfader and the other on the left side of the turntable where it forces you to play.  It would have been nice for all to have an option that flips the on-screen track lines so that you could control the turntable on the right side.The controller is average quality, the turntable being the highlight.  I'll be interested to see how well the crossfade bar holds up during rigorous play - it felt a little flimsy right out of the box.CONCLUSIONI'm not sure who this game will appeal to.  On the one hand, players will no DJing experience will likely find the game and controller too frustrating to bother with, while those who've used the real thing will find the dissimilarities with the turntable controller a turn-off.  Plus based on the opinions of several players, the game itself lacks the immediate ""I can't wait to play that again"" fun factor that the Guitar Hero series has.  Much like how the Guitar Hero series has evolved, maybe the next release of DJ Hero will fix the problems by upgrading the controller and allowing players more creativity in the way that they play with it.  Until then, just pass this one up.",2,Blown Potential - Wait for DJ Hero 2,1256169600,"10 22, 2009"

You buy this game just for the controller. Take the controller out of the box and set it aside.

While you are waiting for the good Beatmania game to arrive, use the American version as a frisbee. That is all it is good for. The music is bad, the mechanics are somehow wrong, it is missing modes, and it has a total fatal flaw that kills any possible aspect that could redeem itself. It has... an unlocking system.This is how it works. Under freeplay when you first start the song, you have Jam Jam Raggae, that's it. What you do is play Arcade mode, play a song you have not played before so it gets added to the freeplay mode. THEN, to top that off, not all the songs are selectable. You have to play an easy song first, then you can select more songs. Assuming from the crappy music selection you find yourself playing this garbage even with the TV on mute (yeah, they get THAT old), you get to select another possibly better song. After the second, all the songs (I think become accessible). You have to do this at least 20 times before you get to have a reasonable amount of songs to play for freeplay mode. Really, the only good song I see is PARANOiA, and it is not even the good one. It is the 190 dirty mix. Couldn't they have used PARANOiA 2MB KCET Clean Mix at least? Or what about Max 300?

8799,183307,A1CLHGYM5NIM4C,B0050SXFKE,Christian Cavicchio,"[2, 2]","Out of all the AC releases, AC3 in my opinion, is the most frustrating and unfulfilling.  While it was certainly ambitious in its setting and story, I felt the game fell short of many AC staples.I liked the concept of a new setting and a farewell to Ezio.  The story starts off on a high note but steadily dwindles to a crawl towards its middle to end moments and tries to pick up speed in its final moment.  The story as a whole, is very bloated and long winded. Following Connor from boy to man to hero while fun, is just too long winded.  AC3 takes its time getting to where it needs to go and not in a fun way. Voice acting this time around is mostly stellar (as with most AC titles) with the exception of main character Connor not really displaying much emotion and given a very wooden performance. Visiting locations like Boston and New York are great (Especially being from Boston) however, your time spent in these locations (while it does depend on your playing style and choices) is limited story wise and The Frontier is really what plays a major role here.  Travelling from one Frontier to another to another is really what bogs down game play and everything there is to do in The Frontier, is frankly boring and loses its luster quickly.  Other random tasks like searching out Ben Franklin pages is infuriating and pointless while seeking out things like the Peg Leg trinkets are a little more interesting and bring the player to some interesting nooks and crannies within the environments.Control seemed to be a huge issue (PS3) and not as fluid as in past installments.  This is perhaps my biggest complaint.  I am more than adept at the main protagonists parkour abilities but, in this one they seemed plain clunky and broken.  Often turning around when you want Connor to climb up. Jumping off to the side when you were expecting to land on a neighboring rooftop (instead you end up with broken legs and a desynch). Or just plain not responding to your commands one second and responding the next.  Its simply, or complicatedly, all over the place.Leaving the Animus to traverse through the modern day story is just as frustrating.  The game gives little direction as to what your next move or location should be.  Navigating the caves to unlock the mysteries of the cosmos is bland and uninspired.  It's an ugly setting that was for the most boring part of the game.  Nothing was game-breaking and nothing was groundbreaking either... These problems made for an alarmingly frustrating experience and left me in that place where I couldn't decide if I should just push through it to the end or walk away entirely and move on to Black Flag.With all these problems, the game has some stand out points.  As long as you're not listening to Connor, the voice cast is amazing and the game creates some truly interesting characters and plots.  Haytham's story is more interesting than Connor's though we spend very little time with him. The Antagonist is superbly done and the game just looks fantastic.  Navigating through the trees in the frontier is fun (when it works) and the new arsenal available to Connor (Rope arrows and such) are a welcome and lethal addition to the series.  While running through the cities little cut scenes will appear when you enter a house and see Connor running through it like something out of a James Bourne film is nice and adds to action.  The music is incredible and overall, the story does have its moments it just takes so long to get to them.  The biggest draw to the game are the few and far between ship battles.  These almost make the game worth it alone and only makes me look forward to Black Flag all the more.If the AC series is your favorite (or one of) series of all time, then you will find this one to be an inspired tale full of new things to do and explore.  If you're more of the casual player when it comes to them then expect more of the same with some bad moments interspersed throughout making the game almost infuriating.

10658,148027,A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ,B002YJ0U3W,Nutwiisystem.Com,"[9, 9]","As some reviewers have noted, My Fitness Coach 2 has absolutely nothing in common with My Fitness Coach other than the name. Here's why.The original My Fitness Coach was developed by a company called Respondesign (who had created the original version, called Yourself!Fitness for the Playstation 2). It was a runaway hit on the Wii. Granted, it was little more than a glorified exercise video (the exercises consisted mainly of calisthenics, with no usage of the Wii's unique controllers). But you could definitely get a great cardio workout from it.In the meantime, in the UK, there was another completely different fitness game called NewU Fitness First: Personal Trainer, developed by another company called Lightning Fish Games. It was a very different kind of title. My Fitness Coach featured long 15-30 minute cardio workouts, while NewU had much shorter sub-10 minute workouts. My Fitness Coach had a personal trainer that gave you a fitness test and seemed to personalize your workout for you based on your goals; New U had a limited set of prepared workouts. My Fitness Coach had over 500 unique exercises, NewU had about 80.Perhaps in an attempt to cash in on the success of My Fitness Coach, Ubisoft simply renamed NewU to My Fitness Coach 2 and released it in the US market. Unfortunately, they completely failed to understand nor acknowledge that the over 1.8 million fans of the original My Fitness Coach liked the original for a reason, and wouldn't take too kindly to them slapping a ""sequel"" moniker on a new game that bore no resemblance to it.It's a shame, because the NewU Fitness First game itself is not too bad when evaluated on its own merits (as opposed to being in the shadow of the My Fitness Coach). If you need short 10-minute workouts throughout your day, whether early in the morning, at a lunch break, or before bed, it provides a pretty decent workout.Also, it does use the Wii remote and balance board and is mostly accurate. As with most other Wii games not developed by EA Sports or Nintendo, there are times where the motion controls are sketchy, but at the end of the day it's far superior to the atrocious motion controls of games like Jillian Michaels 2010 or Your Shape.It also includes recipes and lifestyle tips (which mostly contained nutritional facts about foods). The recipes looked interesting but at the end of the day were pretty useless, as most of us don't have a Wii in the kitchen. Plus, they totally failed to convert some of the instructions for an American audience (I have no idea what 200C/Gas Mark 6 means).Its ""Challenges"" section is, in my opinion, the best part of the game. There are five options: Dance, Cardio Test, Army, Boxing, and Baseball. It's a little misleading at first, because I was expecting to do dance movements under Dance, baseball simulation under Baseball, etc. But what it really means is that it'll do basic workout routines to exercise the muscles and build the stamina that a dancer, a trainer doing cardio work, someone in the Army, a boxer, or a baseball player would need. And unlike the short and simplistic exercises in the regular workout parts of the game, these challenges really make your heart pump and last a good long time for meaningful toning, muscle gain, and weight loss.As a fan of the original My Fitness Coach, I have to say I'm as disappointed with this game as everyone else (or more precisely, with Ubisoft insulting our intelligence by calling a completely different game a sequel to the first). But on the merits of the game itself, I'll give it three stars--it's certainly not the best out there, but as another reviewer said it provides a decent alternative if you want to add a little variety to your Wii exercise routine.",2,A game with good potential ultimately marred by very poor marketing,1274745600,"05 25, 2010"

(one puzzle in particular where you have to sneak into a military base at night... >_> timing is key i hated it i quit playing it for a month.)the game was fun and like all tales of games has some sort of underlying after-school-special message (Tales of Symphonia = Discrimination is wrong... there were several other messages too but this one was the main one that kept slapping you in the face...) to tell you the truth... the only thing i got from ToL was Polluting the world's Freshwater Sources is bad... >_> don't build ships the size of islands and have it run off of the life force of mermaids with feet. and the hot airhead chick is really a goddess... and not to take in wild animals as pets they can turn on you.all and all id have to give this a tree only because there was alot of this game that got on my nerves. the battle lay out the slow but rushed story line where they gave you too much information on something not relevant but not enough on something you needed. (okay, go fight this guy... why? because he's evil... this rock is an ancient rock passed down from the Goddesses to the humans millions of years ago if you set it on fire... that sort of thing.) the voice acting was slow and bad and i'm sure you'll spend more time pressing x to get through the cut scenes than actually watching them (god knows i wanted to).  but the voice acting would have been on the back burner for me if it was just the minor skits but it's the major skits and cut seens that take up a LARGE ten percent of the game. the other 89percent is spent making different types of bread to carry around which you can only carry fifteen in total. not fifteen different kinds, just fifteen. five Bagles with lox, five pizzas three bread loaves a pie and a sandwich (really?) yes really. i'm half dead i have no apple gels left the onlything that will keep me from dying is a loaf of bread... >_> sure why not.bit it is a good game if you have the patience for it... i did though it took me a while. it's not a CAPTIVATING story but it's certainly enough to pass a few summer days.**sorry for the rant**",3,eh,1333584000,"04 5, 2012"

Bioware has yet to really fail with this, they do great writing simple as that.

I'm a big fan of gems such as Two Worlds and Arcania to name a couple but I could not overlook the overall poor execution in Magus.I mean there are some good ideas here such as different powers, lots of loot, interesting enemies, etc but good god is this game bad. The powers which are these rapid fire balls of light seem to only differ from one another based on color, size, and spread - I can't really tell the difference. Along the same lines, the aiming is just ridiculous-pretty much swerve into place to where enemies are in the line of fire.The graphics are indeed pretty dated. I think calling them PS2 graphics is a little off but they are definitely not pushing the PS3 envelope here. The textures are pretty fuzzy and everything is pretty dark-probably to mask more detail. Did I mention there is no control for brightness or gamma? Yeeeeaaaaaaa.....The dialogue is bad sure but that's actually one of the good things about this game I think. The protagonist literally looks like a doofus and talks like he is super bad. Just a really strange choice there but it can be entertaining. The dialogue of the enemies are pretty annoyingly funny especially of the dragon men. It literally sounds like you doing your best attempt at a monster voice-pretty bad.The loot is interesting in that what you find can be worn such as belts, amulets, rings, armor, helmets, etc. And you can assign various gems you find to make them more powerful such as increasing strength, dexterity, green power, etc.Which reminds me of the stats and difficulty-there is absolutely no reason to upgrade anything other than strength because there are NO occasions where you need to worry about dexterity (defense-lol!) and vitality. Strength raises overall attack power so there is no need to worry about increasing stats in Green, Blue, Red, or wherever!The enemy design is pretty dumb. Let's see you have the Creature from the Black Lagoon dragon men, you have unicorn men, you have 10 billion soldiers and enemies literally all with the same armor, and you have skeletons. And the main challenge of the game is hordes of these enemies coming after you which isn't very challenging and extremely repetitive. I mean you could eat a hot pocket in one hand and spam R1 in the next, rubber band the left stick to move forward, and you would pretty much win the game.Anyway-I guesssss it was entertaining for the night I played it? if you want to waste an afternoon doing something I highly recommend going outside but if it's raining-I guess you can play this?

It's alot like the old NBA JAM games for super nintendoexcept instead of two on two its three on three. You do pretty much the same tricks over and over again on each possesion and then dunk the ball. Sure the dunks look cool and nothing is better than throwing the ball off your friends head but after a while its all the same. There is no goal tending so the best thing is to have a 7 footer like shaq just guarding the basket. since its first to 21 pts (normal shot=1 pt, long range =2 pts) during a regular game you can get at least 2 blocks, most likely 7 or 8. In addition to the score of the game you get pts for doing scoring. There isn't a good was to explain this except give an example. After doing a couple tricks then dunking you would get about 50000 pts. For just shooting the ball (no dunk) you get around 50 pts. three pointer will give you 250 pts. These pts add up and at the end of each individual game you get reward pts. Reward pts can be used at the store to unlock hidden features. The only thing a team needs to be excellent is to have a person who handles well ( so during tricks the ball doesn't get knocked loose) and a big man. During game play, you fill your game braker meter by doing tricks. Fill it once to do a level one game breaker. If you choose not to use it you can pocket it and fill it again to do a level 2 gamebreaker. Level one game breakers add 1 pt to your score and take away a pt from the opponent for a shot from inside the three pt line. you can shoot a three and get two pts and have one pt taken away from the opponent. The downside of just shooting threes is that you get a lot higher score for dunks (if you do a level two gamebreaker after a couple tricks and dunk it could get as much as 500000 pts). One really nice feature is the be a legend mode where you create a player and pick up a few teammates and take them to the street for pick up games (as opposed to the regular nba mode) If you finish the nba mode first you can build a better begining player to play with, but for more of a challenge you can start out fresh. You go to courts and play the best the city has to offer. It has alot of games to play before you finish so it'll take around 10 hrs to play. A major flaw to me is that players can't be traded. Western Conference teams made alot of moves during the offseason and we can't play with the new teams. That means lakers don't play with payton and malone, timberwolves won't have sprewell or cassell Robinson is still on the spurs and so on.

But Shattered Dimensions was a huge step backwards.  I liked the design visuals, and I loved the concept of having four different Spider-Men with different sets of powers and moves.  And getting voice actors from the cartoons to do the voices here?  Brilliant.But once you get past those initial selling points and actually start playing the game ... it's just plain boring.First, the plot itself is not even slightly engaging.  It's deus ex machina up the whazoo: every single level, you're dropped off in some random, disparate location by Madame Web, and told that there's a villain nearby who has a fragment of some mystical device and that you have to stop him and get the fragment.  Otherwise, there's no real connection from level to level, so there's no real build-up of suspense, no unfolding plot, and hence no emotional investment.Second, the levels are tedious and repetitive.  Villain has fragment.  You pursue villain across a linear landscape.  You catch villain, villain gets away.  You give chase.  Rinse and repeat until final confrontation.Third, web-swinging has gone from being one of the most fun things to do (in the sandbox games) to an absolute chore.  I'd like to be more specific but honestly I don't know where to begin.  Just swinging from point A to point B without falling into the space in between is difficult.I get why Beenox opted for a different approach from the Treyarch games which, since the success of Spider-Man 2, had become somewhat tedious.  Spider-Man 3 was bad, and Web of Shadows was only a mild improvement over it.  But at least, at the end of the day, swinging across the city was fun.  Where those two games went wrong is that they were both rushed.  The graphics were shoddy, the fighting system and AI were terrible (though WOS was immensely better than 3), and the side missions were repetitive.Beenox took all the wrong lessons from the failure of those two games - and to make matters worse, it seems they are taking the wrong lesson from the success of Shattered Dimensions because the upcoming game (developed and released in less than a year) looks to be more of the same.Shattered Dimensions was terribly dull.

Having to run and hide is a lame idea, especially if ""hiding"" includes standing behind a rocking chair in full view, and yet not being seen by the monster.  Weak!  I'd rather blast my way through a mass of zombies than hide behind dust-motes from a ghost.  I do have to give credit where credit is due, though.  The concept of having to help ghosts find peace was pretty cool and a nice challenge in addition to puzzle solving.  If they work it in better with some firepower, I think it would make a really cool game.  Also, the way she was hard to control when she got scared was cool.  It added more realism to the game.

The game should have had at least twelve missions to play in it to be called a full version game.  This game is suppose to be a full version game.  Not a add-on or an expansion game. I feel like I have been ripped off by someone.Of the six missions, only the first four missions honor the brave soldiers that fought in World War II.  The last two missions do not honor the brave soldiers who fought during World War II.  The last two missions are fantasy made missions that remind me of going to amusement park.  You have super Nazi's in the last two missions that take forever to kill. Shoot them in the head or blow them up with grenades it doesn't do any good. It takes at least fifty to a hundred shots with your weapon to take down one of these super Nazi's.  I felt like I needed to find a super weapon like a laser gun to bring them down.I notice in the fifth mission (Operation Varsity) there are railroad cars that are not European made rail cars.  They are North American made railroad cars.  What is up with that?  It is quite obvious that somebody just slapped some North American railroad cars into the mission just to finish it.In the last mission, (Operation Der Flakturm) American paratroopers land on a German Flak tower in Germany right after Operation Varsity.  This mission never took place during World War II.  The Russians were the only ones to assault German Flak towers during the war. In fact, the Flak tower used in the game never even got built in Germany.  There was three generations of Flak towers built by the Germans during the war and only the first two generations of towers were built in Germany. Those towers were built in the German cities of Berlin and Hamburg during the war.  The game shows a third generation built Flak tower built in Germany, that was actually built in Vienna, Austria during the war.  Somebody screwed up.It almost seems like two different teams of game developers work on the Medal of Honor Airborne game.  One team worked on the first four missions of the game which were realistic and actually happen during World War II while another team worked on the last two missions in the game which are more sci-fi and fantasy.  I really wanted to like this game because I'm a big World War II fan.  With all the actual events that happen during World War II, why would the game developer need to makeup any missions for the game?I have to say, too, that this is the hardest PC game that I have ever had to load onto my PC.  I have never seen a game with more bugs and problems.  There is virtually no tech support from EA.  I was very, very frustrated with trying to load and play this game.This another example of a game that should of went somewhere that ended up going nowhere. Either the game publisher or the game developer just wanted to hurry and finish the game just to try to beat the holiday rush. Somebody was trying to hurry and make some money on this game before the other big name titles come out later on  this year.

2603,187149,A187JA7XRK26NP,B0050SYZS0,"Brandon Zarzyczny ""BigZ7337""","[10, 17]","This is the same review as the one I posted for the standard edition of the game. I will however add that with the Collector's Edition, one of the biggest benefits you receive is the new Prothean character that is really awesome, and it would cost 10 dollars to buy the DLC without buying the CE. Other extras in this edition include essentially useless in-game weapons and a robo-dog that just walks around in the Cargo Bay. You do however get a cool little art book, a mini comic book, an N7 patch, a post card, and a cool steel case with the special edition. I figure this is worth much more than the extra 20 dollar price increase from the standard edition. Now onto the review of the game:For those that haven't finished Mass Effect 3, the first part of my review will be spoiler free, but the second part must be rife with spoilers because the story and ending is the biggest problem of the game. I'll also preface this review by saying that the ME series had been probably my favorite gaming series of all times, and I beat the campaign of ME1 three times while I finished the campaign of ME2 four times. I had been incredibly excited about the game, and had been able to avoid practically every spoiler except for two smaller ones about EDI and the Prothean character. Even though the game is flawed, I loved pretty much 99% of the game, but the ending was so bad that it has ruined my entire Mass Effect experience. I was going to play the game again with my female character as I loved the voice over work of Jennifer Hale, but now I don't really want to. I was even going to start a new character in ME1 and play all three games in succession, but now it just isn't worth it.So, let's start with the gameplay, which in the Mass Effect series is split between the RPG aspects, and the third person cover shooting battle system. ME3 definitely has the best action gameplay of the entire series, and while it can still be clunky there are constantly amazing moments with dozens of different but equally awesome strategies you could employ. I just wish there were almost more buttons on the controller for this game. It's one of the most effective uses of a controller in any shooter, where you really have so many different attacks you could use at every moment. Most of the clunkiness once again resolves around the action button being the same as the sprint and cover button. I'm not sure if it would work, but it could be interesting if the action button was instead mapped to the select button, the only one that isn't used in the game.Now on to the RPG systems of the game, which is much improved from basic systems in ME2, for Mass Effect 3 they basically took most of what was in ME1 and stripped out the hassle of the massive inventory screen and the repetitive/annoying/time-consuming aspect of destroying/selling the multitude of useless items you received. This interesting new inventory management system works by all of the weapons having a weight, and if you go over a certain weight limit (which is dependent on your character class and certain upgrades you can choose) you can face severe power regeneration penalties. I love this idea, but it can become annoying when all of the good weapons have really high weight. It also ends up limiting the weapons you can bring along, even though I was a Vanguard that selected the increase weight capacity upgrade. There's a possible related result, where you can no longer carry any heavy weapons like in previous games, something that I always loved. Instead there are only four heavy weapons found at few certain points lying on the ground (flamethrower, rocket launcher, some Geth laser gun, and the mini-nuke) with very limited ammo. Back to the main weapons that are in this game, I loved that Bioware brought back the Role Playing elements present in ME1 guns, almost keeping the same names and level presentation. The concept is really smart, where you can purchase an upgrade up to level 5 for each weapon and each weapon add-on (that you can have two equipped on each gun). The only problems here is that I had enough money so that each time I got a new gun I promptly maxed out the upgrades, so the system wasn't as rewarding as it could have been. Also, with the level of each add-on upgrading when you find or buy a new one, while I love this, it was a little uneven where multiple times I upgraded ones I didn't use while I couldn't find the upgrades for the ones I did regularly use. This whole system could be improved with a few adjustments, which is possibly a higher level cut-off limit like in Multiplayer (could make it so that weapons that you like don't become useless because of their stats later in the game) and something that I liked in the first game but disappeared in the sequels. That is a weapon efficiency upgrade system where you could get experience points for every enemy you kill with each weapon type, I think this could really increase the RPG feel while keeping all of the action. One more thing with the weapons, there's an interesting section of the Spectre offices where you have a fire range to test your weapon load-out. I love this idea, especially with all of the different weapons, but it makes no sense to have it on the Citadel, instead it should be in the Normandy Cargo Bay. Too many times I would upgrade a new weapon only to find I didn't like the way it fired. Then there are weapons that I never tried out as their weight was really high and the stats weren't the best. So while I may have possibly liked the way they fired, now I'll never know as I didn't have an opportunity to test them out.I was pretty disappointed that no real changes (non-cosmetic) were made to the armor system. It's much too basic, almost exactly the same as ME2, and I wish there were more options to alter and upgrade your armor. I really kept the same armor for most of the game, even later I just made a few adjustments and all I cared about was getting the bonus percentages I wanted. The armor also looked all pretty similar, except for the helmets, which were mostly pretty goofy looking. Finally, for the different character classes, in this iteration they seem about the same, but some new abilities have been added. One of them that I really loved was the new Nova attack which was really useful when combined with the Biotic Charge, also I like that it's not perfect as it uses up your shields, creating an interesting cost versus benefit play choice.The next aspect of the game is one that has really defined to series up to this point, and that is the conversation system of ME3. I was very disappointed that the conversation options were much more limited in this iteration, where you basically only had the paragon or renegade choice. There was never a paragade response or something else like the sarcastic comments I loved making in Dragon Age 2, at this point in the series it felt like a step back. There was also an annoying amount of conversations that resembled your talks with the DLC characters Massani and Goto. I didn't mind this too much, but it was frustrating when multiple times I would accidently hit the A button one too many times and I would skip the conversation. I also had a few graphics glitches during the normal conversations with choices, where the character's framework was broken or glitched, and they'd be looking all over the place or the eyes would be tracking wrong, it was just really weird. Even stranger, this tended to happen earlier in the game (they either occurred with Liara or Ravik), I didn't really experience it too much later, I'm not sure why. Possibly relating to this, I didn't have any problems importing my character's face as some have, but I think that's because I played around with it in ME2 because I didn't love my Shepard's face.There were multiple times in conversations where there were great little inside joke comments that were only for my Shepard, but I was a little disappointed that there weren't more new in depth conversations with your crew. Even with the new character Vega, while I love the sparring match/conversation you had with him (One of my favorite crew member interactions in the whole series) you don't get to know him as much as you did the previous game's characters. I understand that with the possibility of almost every old character not being present in ME3, the developer didn't want to spend too much time and money on them, but conversely they didn't add many new characters. In total, not counting the DLC character, there are only four new crew members on the Normandy (all of whom are humans): the new playable jock character, a gay male pilot, a gay female communications officer, and a female reporter. I liked all of these new characters (though the reporter is a little generic and annoying) but consider something for a minute. If Garrus and Tali had died in your playthrough of ME2, for most of the game you would only have two playable characters, Vega and Liara. Later of course, you get Kaidan/Ashley and EDI, but it's amazing they didn't add new characters or make more of the characters from ME2 crew members. Even with all of the crew members possible, you don't get a representative from the Krogans and the Salarians, or any of the other non-council races. I expected to see all of the different species send someone onto the Normandy, but for some reason no one did. All we got was a Krogan leader (Wrex!), a Turian leader, and a Quarian leader in the War Room for a few missions. You'd think that if Bioware didn't want to waste time and money on possibly unpopular characters, they would have created more characters that every player would get to know. The only possible explanation for why they didn't do this is that they didn't think they had the time to establish multiple new interesting characters.Another annoying change to something I loved before, was how when you're in the hub-world listening to people's interesting conversations you have to leave the area and come back to hear the next part of the story. In ME2, you could just keep hitting the A button to listen to the rest of the conversation, which to me worked really well. This time, even though the stories are cool, I would lose interest in them as so much time could pass between each part of the telling, also at one point they glitched out and all of the conversations reset. I also had a problem that I figure has to be a glitch where at the last conversation with the Illusive Man, the Paragon and Renegade options were greyed out. With this Shepard I have always selected the blue conversation options in each Mass Effect game every time they appeared, and I also always explore every possible conversation option. I had off the charts amounts of Reputation and Paragon points and still I had a conversation option blocked, the first time this has ever happened to me (in the Mass Effect series and every other video game with a similar conversation system). I felt extremely confused and annoyed that somehow the best possible resolution to the Illusive Man conflict wasn't available to me for no apparent reason.Onto the locations and exploration of the different worlds, something that was one of my favorite parts of the previous games, but is almost non-existent in ME3. Here is where ME3 strikingly reminds me of the failure of Dragon Age 2. Similarly to Kirkwall, the Citadel acts as the only hub-world in the entire Mass Effect 3 game, while in ME2 there were four completely different hub-worlds. This would be okay, as most worlds are under attack from the Reapers, except for the fact that this version of the Citadel is the smallest and most basic of the entire Mass Effect trilogy. Then the Citadel only goes through a very minor cosmetic change halfway through the game, and they expect us, a society full of ADHD people, not to grow bored of the surroundings. We get to go to worlds we've always wanted to explore, like the Turian, Salarian, Quarian, Asari and Human home-worlds, but all of them are filled with waist high walls and they're all being blown up by Reapers and/or attacked by Cerberus. The missions are also relatively short, and we fail to really see anything unique about the planets. Further, ME3 has essentially eliminated the mini missions on random worlds, and the probe mechanic found in ME2. Instead, now you have to fly around each system evading the Reapers while you randomly scan for 2 or 3 of the interesting things, which are either small amounts of fuel or some random unexplained war asset on a planet. Then you get to play a few basic solo N7 missions on the limited number of Multiplayer maps. I understand that exploring Alien worlds isn't a priority in the middle of a war with a group of ancient synthetic/organic hybrid monster spaceships, but I missed this aspect that was hugely present in the previous games.Related to the locations and explorations, I'm going to talk a little bit about the further development of the alien species you encounter. Sadly, we see very little new aspects of the previously introduced alien species, and no new aliens. One thing we do see is our first Krogan female, who is a very cool character, though the time spent with her is short. Also, you don't see too much of the Krogan woman, but this kind of makes sense when you consider the Krogan society. Once again, every other species' females are non-existent, I guess Bioware believes the Asari provide enough females for everyone. Also, I can explain away why we don't see many of the other races' females (though we probably should see them as refugees or scientists), but I find it weird that we don't see any Turian females. From Garrus' previous stories, it has been established that females can serve in their military and can compete with the best of the males (also they're apparently very flexible but don't have much reach). The one new design that Bioware were extremely successful in creating was that of the Prothean. They succeeded in looking like the Collectors and were just extremely cool. I loved even more the reality of what their culture was in comparison to what everyone had believed. The only problem is that for some reason Bioware decided to make this important and awesome character first-day DLC.  Finally, the worst aspects of the new alien design in ME3 are the Quarians.I either wanted Bioware to keep the Quarians faces secret, or I wanted a beautiful scene to show off Tali's true face, they even had the perfect situation when they are on her home planet of Rannoch. Instead Bioware was lazy, and they just had Tali give a picture to Shepard that he could keep in his cabin. This picture showed a poorly photo-shopped stock photo of a cute human woman that probably took an hour or two to make. Every single piece of Tali fan art I've seen is a hundred times better than what Bioware chose. Since Turians and Quarians are so closely related (same amino acid structure) then they would probably look more similar to each other instead of being human (except for some tattoos and different hands). Of course, they would be also be different in many ways (the Turian world experienced a lot of radiation which caused them to develop the armor plates) and there was something about the Quarians where they have a symbiosis with the plant life on their world, and because of this their immune systems weren't fully developed (this was then made worse by years and years spent on sterile space ships). Even if Bioware wanted a mostly human design to appease Tali fans (which there is some precedent for as the eyes and nose appear human behind the mask) I've seen much better humanoid designs for Tali. I mean it's a little strange where fans are more talented and spend more time creating images of a very important design than the official developer.Here's where I'm going to stick a bunch of the random features in the game. I was a bit surprised by the complete elimination of mini-games in ME3, while they were all a little annoying before, instead of fixing them now they just removed them, and the doors/safes take a little longer to open, implying that you're automatically performing some type of hack or bypass. The reputation system is a much appreciated addition/adaptation, where you get standard reputation points for performing moral neutral actions, and every Paragon or Renegade point adds to your total. Because of this, players are no longer punished from not being an absolute character, and no matter you preference if you have enough reputation points both of the Paragon and Renegade conversation choices are unlocked. However, it is pretty goofy how the bar is filled up very early into the game, I was still getting lots of points, but there was no visual interpretation of the increase. I almost wish there was a bigger bar, or even a numerical presentation of all of your reputation points. Another new addition to this game is the War Assets and Effective Military Strength (EMS). I really liked this feature, as everything you've done in the Mass Effect series is represented here. However, once again the bar fills up incredibly early in the game. There's also some really disturbing about the EMS, and that's the aspect of Galactic Readiness, which can only be increased by playing multiplayer. So if you hate Co-op Multiplayer, or if you don't have enough money or the ability to have an Xbox Live Gold Membership, your Galactic Readiness is locked at 50%. This means that all of your War Assets will be halved for the EMF. So let's look at my level, I had 7245 points with a Galactic Readiness hovering around 100%. If I wouldn't have played Multiplayer, then I would have only had 3622 EMF points, which is enough to get the endings but is not enough to get the ""best"" ending. To put this in perspective, I played every mission available except for a few that glitched out on me. The only things that might have lowered my war assets, were that in ME1 I saved the Council, in ME2 I destroyed the Collector Base (even though for the story Cerberus still found most of it intact), and in ME3 I cured the Krogan Genophage which annoyed the Salarians. One other random thing, in ME3 you don't have someone like Kelly that will take care of your fish. The only option is to buy a crazy expensive Aquarium VI, and if you don't your fish will die, even if you feed them every chance you get. You'd think EDI would be able to monitor your fish tank for free, but I guess it'd be a little degrading considering her new role as a crew member on herself.Now onto the last aspect of the game that isn't the story, and that is the newly added Co-op Multiplayer. I was initially concerned about this aspect of the game, but I've had a lot of fun playing with it. I did have a lot of problems with the EA servers the first couple of days though, and this was exasperated by the fact that you only get experience and credits by either successfully completing the mission, or by dying. I wish that the game would save your experience after each wave, especially when any expendable items you use before you disconnect are lost forever. After this I also glitched out a couple times, once I got stuck in a wall, but I was actually still able to kill a bunch of the enemies while some of them were unable to get me. Another time I glitched out during multiplayer, it was much worse and much weirder, where the whole stage was shaking like I was in the middle of an earthquake. Then while I was running, I ended up floating in the air for a few feet before falling through the floor (I actually have a video of it but it's kind of crappy since I couldn't find my camera and used my iPod). Sadly or thankfully, my team members were a capable bunch (even though it was a silver Reaper mission) and were able to beat the 10 waves, though it took like 20 minutes where I just had to float there in nothingness and wait. The even weirder thing was that I could damage some of the enemies with biotic powers, and the enemies were able to kill me. However, once I died I would immediately come back to life. Looking past the glitches, I love leveling up the different characters, and with a group of capable players the missions can be very fun. However, after a while I grew a little bored playing the missions, they're all just too similar. Then I worked really hard on maxing out the Vanguard branch, but when I hit level 20, to get the achievement I promoted the soldiers. This is a cool idea, but I wish there was more of a reward for this, or possibly the ability to still use the high level characters when attempting a Gold level mission, or at the very least a new character plus where they get an extra bonus so you're not starting from the very beginning of the character. The biggest problem I have with the multiplayer though is that EA decided to for the first time in a AAA console game to include a freemium pricing structure for the locked characters, weapons and items. I actually find this kind of offensive, as I could play the multiplayer for hours and get a random pack someone else could get immediately by shilling out two dollars. I especially have a problem with this pricing as you could spend two dollars on a pack, and get nothing you could use. If you're going to charge for items others could get by just playing the game, I think you should be able to pick items, although of course it would make it even more unfair for people that don't want to be tricked into paying for items that are already in the game. I think that the Multiplayer could be saved with a patch, and possibly more game modes than the 10 waves that always feature the play modes capture the flag, secure the base, head-hunt certain enemies, and kill everything moving. As it currently stands, I can't see this multiplayer establishing a consistent faithful base for anything nearing long term.Now, I can finally get to the aspect of the game that had me the most upset/frustrated, and that is the story. From here on in, warning, there be major spoilers ahead. Right from the start of the game the story is goofy. A minute after our first look at the ME universe's Earth, the Reapers attack, not giving the player any time to acclimate to the game. Then a little later (after a goofy child's death that will haunt Shepard for the rest of the game) you are introduced to the game's one and only plot device, blueprints for an all-powerful weapon designed but not completed by the Protheans, called the Crucible. This is just so generic and out of the blue, it doesn't make any sense, but I was ok with playing along. You then have a mission involving each of the previous ME game's characters, some small and some large. The developers then proceed to kill off two of my favorite characters in these missions, Mordin and Thane. However, I can accept their deaths, especially since it was established previously that both of them were near death (old age and lung disease respectively) and both of them were done very well, they had good deaths. I admit that I felt serious emotion with both of them, and I may or may not have cried through the whole hospital scene.I have a lot of problems with the development of Cerberus as the main antagonist in a game about the Reapers. I understand that Bioware wanted to provide different enemies to face, and I admit that their AI and designs are excellent. However, I don't understand how Cerberus became so powerful. Every time you see them they're a step ahead of you, even when you kill hundreds or thousands of their heavily armed and trained troops. Later they kind of explain this by establishing that they created a refugee Sanctuary that was actually a Human harvesting and indoctrination factory, but it still doesn't quite add up. I didn't love Cerberus in ME2, and things they've done had always been on the border of indecency and terrorism, but it usually seemed to be in Humanity's best interest. However, in ME3 they're all crazy and doing absolutely horrible incomprehensible things, Bioware tries to say it's all because TIM has been slowly indoctrinated and he's now under control of the Reapers, but I never really thought they successfully established this. Probably the goofiest Cerberus plot line is the coup of the Citadel, which made absolutely zero sense. They somehow gained control of Udina (who while being a douche bag didn't have any connections to Cerberus and had no reason to betray the rest of the Council) and managed to infiltrate the Citadel which is supposed to be the safest and most guarded place in the Galaxy (they even again said they upgraded the security). Then they for some reason wanted to assassinate the entire council, for reasons that are never explained.Up until around halfway through the game, I didn't love the story, but I was in love with the game and having a lot of fun playing it. I mean the actual story for ME2 was pretty basic and goofy, but I still absolutely loved the game. Then, after the previously mentioned Cerberus coup of the Citadel, I received the first realization that Bioware might not care about their fans, or that they might possibly even hate us. Previously in the Citadel, you met up and talked to Kelly Chambers in the refugee camp. There was a great little scene where after asking if she wants to rejoin the Normandy, she describes the horror she experienced on the Collector ship, and that she can't be on the Normandy as it reminds her of what she faced. Instead, she's helping the refugees coming into the Citadel. I loved this little interaction, and I thought it was great fan service for people that liked Kelly. Then after the coup, when walking around the refugee camp you hear two people talking and they basically say ""Have you seen that red headed woman who was helping out so much?"" ""You didn't hear? A Cerberus soldier came up asking if she was Kelly Chambers, and after she said yes he just shot her in the head."" ""Huh, I guess if Cerberus asks you if you're someone, you should just say no."" ""Hah hah hah.""  This was a character I spent the whole of ME2 talking to and growing to care about, and Bioware decided to kill her off so disrespectfully and unnecessarily, I was just absolutely horrified. I wished I could have never heard that conversation, but no, it will now always be in my brain.After this point, everything was ok, not perfect but I pretty much enjoyed all of the events and there were some truly awesome kickass scenes (I loved the fight where you called on the mother of all Thresher Maws and the brokering of peace between the Quarians and Geth), until the final battle to retake Earth. The whole strategy for retaking Earth was a little goofy, but I didn't mind it too much. There was also a great area where before the final battle you walk around the camp and talk to all of your party members, and you can even call and talk to the previous game's characters that aren't playable in ME3. The conversations are a little short, but I enjoyed all of them. Then after fighting for a while, you get to the beam to take you to the Citadel (Which was overtaken by the Reapers without any explanation of how & you can assume billions of people were killed) and everything breaks apart in a million pieces. You know the developer did something wrong when fan created explanations/interpretations make more sense than what we were actually given (The most logical being that the whole Citadel sequence was an indoctrinated dream). Other people have more succinctly examined and explained all of the different problems and plot holes, so I won't go too in depth here. Nevertheless, you are apparently hit by the Reaper's laser beam that destroys everything it touches, but here you only get some melted armor and a beat up face. You also receive a very powerful heavy pistol with unlimited ammo that you use to kill the Reaper creations between you and the teleportation beam. When you get to the beam and are transported to the Citadel, somehow both the Illusive Man and Anderson beat you to the main room. There's this whole thing where somehow TIM is able to control your body and make you shoot Anderson, but you are able to break control and kill TIM.After ascending the elevator to the merged Crucible and Citadel console, a God-like AI in the form of the dead child from Earth appears. Here, Bioware for some reason decides to give you more questions instead of providing the player with any answers. The God-child says that the Reapers are his answer to the problem that Synthetic life (pure order) will eventually completely wipe out all Organic life (pure chaos). Basically, the Reapers were created to save Organic life from Synthetics by murdering and harvesting every developed race each 50,000 years (A synthetic being created hybrids to kill organics to save them from being killed by synthetics). Through this whole interaction, Shepard acts completely subjugated and accepts everything the child says as absolute truth. You are finally given three options, you can control the Reapers (presented as the blue or Paragon choice even though it was represented by TIM, who was at least a Renegade character), you could destroy the Reapers along with all synthetic life (presented as the red or Renegade choice even though it was represented by Anderson, who was absolutely a Paragon character), or you could take the third option which would merge all organic and synthetic life (presented by no one, but this is obviously the choice that the God-child AI wants). Then, no matter what choice you make, as long as your war assets are beyond a very small level, Shepard dies, the Reapers leave Earth or are destroyed, every Mass Relay is destroyed (hopefully in a way different than what was seen in the Arrival DLC or entire systems might have been wiped out of existence), and the Normandy (After Joker apparently flees the battle on Earth) just barely escapes the blast and crash lands on an Eden-like planet, with characters that were just with you rushing the beam somehow being magically transported to the Normandy.Then that's it, the game is over except for a ridiculous conversation featuring a star-child and an old man taking place in a forest that resembles the one in Shepard's dream (and a flash of Shepard taking a breath if you had enough EMS and chose to destroy the Reapers). Oh, also there's an insulting message telling you to buy the future DLC Bioware releases, and you're set up back on the Normandy before the raid on the Cerberus base. I literally walked all around the Normandy trying to talk to everyone, and it felt like I was in a different dimension, it was just so weird and awkward. The only real difference between the three endings is the color of the beam the Crucible emits and the explosion that follows. When faced with the choice, I watched each ending on Youtube, and decided on the Green/Synthesis ending. Partly because it was the weirdest, but mostly because Edi and Joker embrace in that end, and if I had to die & the universe had to be irreversibly changed (most likely leading to many of the stranded races on Earth dying of starvation and never seeing their homes or loved ones) at least someone could find some happiness in this ending.So why am I and almost every Mass Effect fan outraged at the ending""s"" Bioware gave us? (In one poll found on the official Mass Effect forums 91% of around 60,000 fans hated the ending and wants Bioware to change it completely, and 6% still wanted the ending slightly adjusted). First and foremost, the ending is so bleak and depressing, that there is no opportunity for happiness or even a sense of accomplishment that should come with beating a video game. I've never before played a game that punished me for beating it. Then there are so many plot holes with weird and abrupt revelations that make no sense. However, the biggest problem with the ending is that no choice that you made in all three games has any bearing on the outcome. As long as your Shepard didn't die in ME2 and you have the minimum amount of war assets or EMS in ME3 you get the same ending as someone that worked hard in each Mass Effect game and created their perfect Shepard story, maxing out all of the meters, doing all of the missions. I wouldn't have liked any ending where Shepard dies, but I could have accepted it if it was well done and provided closure, instead of just appearing to be the crumpled pieces of paper that a writer with any talent would have thrown into the trash.The prevailing sense of hopelessness despair and depression was never before found in the Mass Effect games. Even though you faced suicide missions, if you did everything right only one of your",2,An Entire Game Series Ruined by the Ending,1332028800,"03 18, 2012"

Game designers, this is a PC game you're designing and not a console game.  Let's start with the bad points as Im  sure all the readers would like to read first. The game committed the most  sinful act of not providing a save game feature accessible anytime and  anywhere in the game. You could only save the game when it loads a new  scene or level. I was in a dungeon for 2 hours (real-time), dying, and I  couldnt save the game because you have to walk out of the dungeon to make  the game reload the level and save your points. This is crazy! This is an  RPG we're playing here. I mean, Final Fantasy III (console game) had built  in save points in the dungeons. Why cant a PC game like this have one? This  is a real turn-off. Next is the interface. I still have to figure out how  to properly move the character. It's so hard to control the camera as you  move the character in the game. The view pans out then suddenly pans in.  The game tried to make its interface unique and it ended up making the game  more complex. Graphics are good. Nice colors, voice acting was ok. You need  a good sized system though to run this game like a PIII 600 and 32mb video  card. Story: well, this game completely ignored the pen and paper version  with too many battles in it.

Maybe I'm hoping for too much, but it would be nice to just double click the desktop icon and play the game.I thought the technical issues in the game were basic: over populated servers at launch, maybe a graphic card driver acting buggy, small things that get patched. I at least expected the game to launch.Really, the low reviews are not hype or people blowing smoke. There are real problems. Avoid for now.*UPDATE*I finally got the game to launch, and have played on and off all day. It's battlefield, nothing really new going on. If you've got some friends who are just real fired up to play, you can probably look past the crashes and poor performance. If you're just looking for a fun shooter, look else where. The fact that the game is in this state is just sad. Plenty of documented work is being done to improve the game (I've only had a crash kick me out mid-match twice), but it still should not have been released like this).",1,"Maybe, if it would actually play",1385683200,"11 29, 2013"

If you want to play ranked warzone well your out of luck here.Epic really dropped the ball here.Plus you can no longer just drop in unranked matches. The game from this perspective just go and play has been ruined I must say. The lag has you glitching all over the board  and you just want to drop out but even this you cant do ,you must shut down your xbox.Than go wait ten minuites to get into a game you have no idea what type or area it will be in.GOW1 was great ,Epic could have just revamped and upgraded the maps ( as they did and they look really great I have to say) fine tuned the players(as they did again) added some great weapons( as they did to some extent,the balance here is a bot off) and the game would have been awesome. The shotgun makes an odd pop  noise here ,unlike gears 1 where it was authentic.Plus you cant shoot and run ,very little shotgun battles now.Some like that but really if you take out all the parts that made GO1 great than you are changing a great game not making it better.The chainsaw duels if the other failings of this game werent so great too would in itself almost ruin game.Gone are Gears 1 sneak ups with the shotgun and now its a free for all of shotgun attacks .Very lame and boring and takes the skill factor to about ""0"". And the duel chainsaw attacks pressing b like crazy is a joke too.Like playing ateroids from the 80,s.Just smash the buttons.No skill no fun just crazy.All in all the game has taken all that was good about gears 1 out of the game,made it absolutely stunning to look at, added lag that is so frequent you drop out of games on rountine just due to that,has a horrible menu that you cant just jump in any more and play and you have no clue what you will be playing.Taking the shotgun and chainsaw elements out of the gears type gameplay is a real shame too as now its like your not even playing gears of war but a whole new game.If they wanted to make a whole new game than they should have by why did they ruin this one? The horde mode is fun but again severe lag,horrible menu and lobby system too.If Epic doesnt at least fix the lag and flickering issues this game will never be played like the last one. I guess people will get used to the altered weapons but the lobby system I doubt it thats a  disaster.Just go play and you here ten people complaining about framerate,lag,weapons and the horrible lobby system.Their were never complaints about this while playing Gears 1, but now their is1 Says alot when you get ten people in room all complaing ,dropping out due to lag tooI give the game a ""C"" in its persent form ,if lag is fixed and lobby system where you can pick a game and get in it relatively quick like gears 1 than I would upgrade to a ""B"".The other issues are just too much to overcome to give it a better score.",2,Unplayable Multiplay game,1226361600,"11 11, 2008"

I had to replace my original PS2, which finally died after about 5 years of abuse.  It took me forever to find one of the ""newer, slimmer"" PS2 consoles.  I did manage to buy one, and within 2 days of use, it died.  I took the stupid thing back for an exchange, but the EB Games where I bought it was out, so I got a refund.  (Great customer service by EB Games, by the way.)  I got to talking to the girl that was working there, and she said that these have been recalled because they have been overheating.  The fan that they put in it is just way too small to handle the heat generated by the unit, and the design is too small to allow proper heat dispersion.  Apparently Sony is being very hush-hush about the recall, but now I know why I couldn't find a single one at Best Buy, Circuit City, Wal-Mart, Target, HH Gregg, or K-Mart.  I was driving around all of Northeast Ohio for a day, getting more and more curious as to why none of these stores had any.

The graphics and in-game fighting are significantly better in JE, but KOTOR gets the nod for better story line, acting and sound engineering.Otherwise they're essentially very similar games.  Aside from the fighting aspects(which in JE is real time, but in KOTOR is turn-based) and the specifics of the level-up process, the essential nature of the game is almost exactly the same.  You encounter people, choose to help them or not, choose to respond to them in one way or another, and then your character is gradually pulled toward the ""good"" or the ""bad"" side of the spectrum.  Bioware makes a claim that the choices you face are more varied here than they are in KOTOR--that there are more shades of ""grey"" in your possible responses--but I don't see any real evidence of that.  It's more like this:  in any field of possible answers there are three ""obvious"" choices (a ""good"" one, a ""bad"" one and a ""neutral"" one), then there are two ""funny"" ones (one one that leans toward ""bad"" and one that leans toward ""good"").  It's not like you have to really puzzle it out.  But you DO have more to read.What's interesting about this is, as the second DVD in this Limited Edition will make clear, the guys at Bioware did a lot of independent research to imbue the settings and story with ""originality"".  Of course, since they were swimming in the same philosophical waters that Lucas enjoyed during his original conception of STAR WARS, they came to a lot of the same conclusions about the nature of good and evil, so, in the end, the commonalities between the two universes are more obvious than the differences.This isn't to say that JADE EMPIRE is a bad game.  Far from it.  But it's hard to separate the two since both came from the same company, and since Bioware refused to make KOTOR 2 because they wanted to do something ""original"".  The truth is that, though it's good, it's not very original.  It's really is KOTOR by another name.That's not an insult.  To equal, and in some respects even exceed, KOTOR is no mere feat.  For that reason, I can definitely recommend JE--but only to those who've never experienced KOTOR.  I think those who are really familiar with KOTOR might want to rent this game to see how Bioware has continued to develop their craft, but its similarity to their earlier work are too obvious to make this an original entertainment in its own right.  I see JE as a step in the natural evolution of console-based RPGs.  I hope that now that they've proven it possible to combine real-time fighting with more traditional aspects of RPG storytelling and character advancement, we'll now see other games with this kind of ""engine"" applied to more original story lines.[For those who have already decided to purchase the game, you might be wondering whether the Limited Edition is worth the price.  And I would say yes.  The ""making of"" material is definitely interesting, as is the playable demo.  Most of it is not exclusive material.  If you have G4 TV, you might have already seen these documentaries.  But they are an interesting enough glimpse into the game creators' craft.]",4,A KOTOR by any other name would smell as sweet,1121040000,"07 11, 2005"
1481,191573,ANUXCX8I7HYN7,B005DVAB0A,Evildead11,"[0, 0]","I've played Ninja Gaiden since the Nintendo years.  Ninja Gaiden Sigma and Sigma II were great (although overly difficult and frustrating at times).  This game has its moments where I think I like it, but then it gets annoying.  There are times when you find yourself fighting what seems like a infinite amount of enemies - they seem to just keep respawning until you are simply bored of fighting them.  In addition to the large number of enemies, some of the types of enemies are also annoying.  Enemies that disappear and reappear, using shields you must break in order to inflict damage, for example.  They are not overly difficult to defeat, rather aggravating to fight.  Aside from that, the game isn't bad.  The difficulty level has absolutely decreased from Sigma and Sigma II, which may turn some people off.  Not me, I enjoy a challenge, but I don't like to get so annoyed at the difficulty of a game that I want to throw the controller through the TV.  The graphics are decent, the controls are fine, the sound is ok (I turn the music down, though, the techno crap is irritating).  Overall, I would say that this is just a decent game.  Not terrible, but not great.  A decent pick up at around a $20.00 price point in my opinion.PROS- Not as demanding as previous Ninja Gaiden games- Nice graphics- Good controls- Pretty fun hack and slashCONS- Annoying enemy design- Enemies are too plentiful at any one time- Voice acting not that great (none of it in the series is)- The story is convoluted...what am I supposed to be doing again??3/5",3,I Want To Like This Game...But,1362614400,"03 7, 2013"

Growing ...","[2, 2]","This is sort of a rare style of game, a dungeon crawler with sci-fi flavors instead of the more traditional swords-and-sorcery feel.  It features ad hoc multiplayer support, though I haven't had a chance to use that yet.*  Characters and game states are saved separately, though they are paired in a single file.  (I have two characters, and after loading one from either of two files, I am them prompted to load the game state from either file, or start a new game.)The game provides a fair variety of weapon types to support different play styles, though the ""classes"" in the game are really the same character over and over, with a few advance points into certain skills.  For example, the Tanker starts with a few points into some melee skills, while the Firebug starts with some points into the flamethrower skill.  The different ""classes"" also start with a slightly different point spread on vital statistics, such as strength and dexterity.  You cannot be a male character, and no matter what you name yourself, the game will still lead you through the story mode as Aileen Harding.The controls are straightforward and the graphics are pleasant enough, though there can be some slowdown depending on how many enemies are on the screen at once.  The music is unobtrusive, and the sound effects are fitting.  The voice acting is lifeless and overwrought, though the cinemas have an interesting aesthetic, sort of cardboard cutout painting animations.  The story is unremarkable and fails to surprise or engage.For what it is, a Diablo clone with sci-fi trimmings, it's a decent game.  The price is right, and the gameplay can be picked up or put down without a lot of investment.  If you can't play it for a few months for some reason, but then come back and don't remember what was happening in the story, it's not going to really affect your game experience much.* Update:  I played around with the ad hoc multiplayer mode recently.  It supports 2-4 players, though I only played with one other person.  You can enter the game at any time, but you will only be able to watch the other player until they run over a checkpoint, at which time you appear and can assume control of your own character.  You must remain within a certain distance of each other, i.e., if you run to NW and your teammate runs SE, before long, you'll both stop and be unable to proceed.  You can also duplicate items by saving in one game, but not the other, then exiting and repeating the process.  So if you find a really great helmet, for example, you can save your game, then give it away, then quit without saving, and restart or rejoin the game to find your killer gear is still... your killer gear.Your multiplayer game save is separate from your single player game save, which itself is separate from your character save, as mentioned earlier.  This means that if you get to, say, level 28 of the story in single player mode, then hook up with a buddy to play around in multiplayer, you will have to start a new multiplayer game, which would put you back to the first chapter of the story.You could get around this by hosting a multiplayer game every time you played alone, but you would be draining your battery more quickly (I don't know how much more quickly) by leaving the WLAN switch on.  On the other hand, you might consider just starting over with a new character and having your friend(s) do the same, since, at some undocumented point, if your levels are too different, the lower level character(s) will not get any experience for their efforts.Some of these aspects of the multiplayer feature, along with the thin-to-nonexistent documentation, makes it feel more like an afterthought than a primary consideration.",3,Simple Sci-Fi Diablo Clone,1211500800,"05 23, 2008"

It feels more like ""Sacred"" with 3D graphics. On the plus side it's VERY easy to play, if you like ""Diablo"", ""Darkstone"", and ""Sacred"" you'll enjoy it, most functions work with a click of the mouse and you can jump in and start playing right away, with no learning curve. It's a simple minded hack and slash romp, enter an area, kill anything that moves, pick up stuff, re-equip your character, sell junk in town, get your completed quest bonus, level up and proceed to the next area. The graphics are gorgeous, it's a very pretty game. The skill system is excellent, you get to choose two ""uber"" skill trees to develop and you can then pick and choose branches to follow. I particularly like the critters you can summon. The Core Dweller is like a cross between The Incredible Hulk and The Human Torch, awesome.There are a bunch of negatives though. BIG negative is the extreme system requirements, you can't play this game on a 128mb PCI video card, and you probably won't be able to run it on an integrated video chip either. I had to upgrade to a 256mb FX6200 PCI card in order to play it on low settings.My system ran ""Oblivion"" and ""Half Life"" without a problem but this game is glitchie, freezes and stutters a lot even with the patch installed.The game is very linear, you need to explore the entire map and go into every nook and cranny if you want to complete all of the minor quests.Replay value is zero, on starting a new charcter I got exactly the same item drops and exactly the same maps as on the first run through.You can't go very far off the path and whichever path you follow ALWAYS leads you to the next town in line. The voice acting is awful, annoying and repetitive, rather than feeling like I'm in Greece or Egypt it sounds like I'm in a deli on the lower east side of NYC. For the Orient area it sounds like they got the waiter at the local Chinese restaurant to do the voices in pidgin english.The critters group in clusters around bone piles and chests, the loot comes shooting out at you. You can't go wrong if you follow one edge of the map around and attack the largest cluster of critters in sight. The backpack is too small but you get some small extra sacks eventually which increase carrying capacity a little. No stash. Interesting upgrade stuff but very awkward to use, and annoying. Usually by the time you accumulate all three or five pieces of the upgrade relic you've found a better item to use that's not upgradeable so you've ended up carrying around a bunch of useless junk.........The caves and temples are mostly small rooms and mazes. The quest system is annoying, there's no sense of doing something for a reason, you click on an NPC with a yellow exclamation point over his head, he rambles on endlessly,to the point that you tune him out, you'll need to click on your quest tab for a summary of what he wants you to do, most quests seem to involve an item the NPC lost while he was running away from the beasties but ""you look like a hardy fellow"" who can recover it for him...........then walk up the path, find the cave or temple, kill a bunch of critters, pick up the quest item and return it to the NPC for the quest bonus, then he'll ramble on some more and give you another task...........repeat again.Another negative is the opening video, there's no way to turn it off, you have to watch the whole thing every time you start the game..........All in all it's a mixed bag but if you want a game that plays like Diablo but doesn't look like Diablo there aren't a lot of choices available.",2,Diablo III it's not,1167782400,"01 3, 2007"

For one, Ironforge is basically unraidable, because the lag is unbearable. Noone wants to raid Ironforge because you can't even move without waiting. Another thing, killing lowbies doesn't give dishonorable kill points. Quite a few times I have seen level 60 alliance players kill a bunch of level 20's at the Morshan Rampart(a place where people can PvP in a specific zone, but as soon as you leave that zone there might be some level 60's waiting to murder you). Blizzard still hasn't fixed the guards yet, so many players stand the chance of being murdered upon exiting the Warsong Gulch.Even worse, there aren't that many items. After playing so long, you soon start to see the same models in the same armor every day. Everyone looks the same practically, and most higher level players have practically the same armor sets now. I have seen so many people with the Dreadmist Rainment that it is laughable. If you use two-handed swords, I bet you probably have a Destiny.Worse yet, the community is filled with younger kids who still don't know how to play at level 60. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a level 60 warrior pull 50 monsters and yell at the group when he dies. There are so many little kids. The new thing seems to be farming kills in the Warsong Gulch. What many of these kids don't realize is the fact that after you kill someone a few times in one day, you don't get any more honor from them. So in essence, they are wasting their own time trying to farm kills.This game is not worth 15 dollars a month.

I played the first Force Unleashed on the console, and while that game had some problems, it was still very fun at times. However, Force Unleashed 2 fails to fix the problems of the original, and introduces a host of new issues.I think my main issue with this game was its length. Even playing the game on hard, with numerous restarts due to technical issues, and having to wait through the annoying, unskippable logo movies, the game still was over in just a few hours. It felt much shorter than the first game, and was not even worth the discounted [...] price. The gameplay, while still pretty fun at times, got very repetitive, simply because I tended to use the same tactic (grip object or stormtroopers, lightning, and throw) on practically every enemy in the game. The saber combat, another weak area of the first game, was not improved at all. I found myself using the same attack over and over again (slash, slash, lightning). The longer moves were easily blocked or interrupted, and I had to force myself to use them just for the sake of variety.I also experienced a number of serious technical issues, from pre-rendered cut-scenes frequently failing to play, to crashes during loading, to completely broken physics where stormtroopers would float in mid-air like it was in zero-gravity. In addition, the game is capped at 30 frames per second, making everything feel a bit choppy. These problems seriously detracted from what would already have been a mediocre game.All in all, I've found the Force Unleashed to be wholly inferior to Jedi Knight 2 and Jedi Academy.

This year, they made significant changes and now it appears everyone wants to punish them for it.  I agree with Pasta Padre when he says that contributes to why EA is so adverse to the risk of making any changes in their games.  Yes, editing players and fantasy drafting is gone this year, and that is a bummer.  That said, CCM especially in Coach mode works as pretty good replacement (with some new features, experience points) for franchise mode to me.Another new addition is the infinity engine, which can make for some good variability in how each play comes out (how a tackle is executed for example), and really gives the game a nice feel.  The gameplay is smooth and fun.Madden Ultimate Team has seen very significant improvements...they have made coins more challenging to get, but have included all kinds of solo challenges that get you players (key packs), coaches, coins, etc.  It feels like for the first time that MUT actually gives incentives to play rather than just being a card trading game.  Also, you can now set almost any price you want for a player, so no more trying to sell super rare numbered cards through suspect middle men (because in the past you would be limited to small/worthless coin amounts).Overall, this is probably a transition year...some of the old features will reappear next year, but built on the monumental changes this year.  In the meantime, I find the game fun and would still recommend it, unless the only feature you are interested in is fantasy draft.EDIT:  This one didn't have the staying power for me that 11 and 12 did so I'm dropping the score to 3 stars.  Maybe its just the yearly re-cycle, but I became very bored.  I also became tired of gimmicks in Ultimate team like key packs that mostly hand out moderate, cheap gold cards (when silvers and low golds are the rares for collections) and puzzle pieces which give them a way to have you hunt 6 cards to add up to one good one.  Madden games are some of the worst investment in video games because of EA's poor server support and killing off the third game back every year (i.e. a month or two after 13 came out, 11's online support was killed.  same cycle will happen for 12 when 14 or I guess it will be called 25 comes out).",3,"Madden 13, some improvements, maybe not enough.",1346284800,"08 30, 2012"

What doesnt feel like old MK are the fatalities which are in some cases just very lame and tame to get the ""T"" rating.  They also added some ""test your might"" mid game mini games along with the ""falling combat"" or whatever they call it which really become annoying after a few plays as they really arent determined by skill, but rather by who smashes more buttons or who ""guesses"" the next move correctly.Most of the DC characters are done well, some more than others.

They keep right on shooting me.to my car crashing into a pole and having the pole get stuck in the car with you in it.trying to get on a boat and getting sucked under the boat and dying.to very bad death animations like having a guy get shot and he flies up on the ceiling then comes back down and starts flopping in between a table and a couch.problems with timed missions.

With many new features this game easily packs a punch twice as hard as the first one though. new features include cut scene creator , sound creator, you can create (with some imagination) many different variations of mini-games within your created level (for me I made a paintinator shooter to play with my roommate). What's my favorite feature? Probably that it's compatible with the Move, although to be truthful I haven't used the Move with it yet (it just sounds like a fun idea that they had).The levels in LBP 2 are even more creative than the first one (if that's even possible), the graphics are more polished (if it matters), and load screens don't seem to take as long. The create mode is a thousand times easy than the first time (very user-friendly). Create mode is easier in the sense that all of the tutorials are right in front of you and you don't have to try everything on your popit in order to see them all. ALSO maybe my favorite improvement is that when you go to create and enemy (using the brain) they are just mindless going back and forth, they actually do what you would expect an enemy to do.The online system is also amazing. The internet style level search bar looks like it will make finding levels you want to play a breeze (since nobody has really made any levels yet, I have not had the pleasure to use it yet).When it comes to cons there really aren't any that I can speak of. Graphics are clean, gameplay is funner than ever, load screens are bearable, and sackboy is still cute as hell.Now I have a sackboy plush to put near my TV as well. The plush is very durable and feels like it is lined on the inside with some reinforcing plastic.The bonus costumes are all great but my personal favorite are the ratchet and clank ones (mostly clank because your sackboy looks so hilarious running around as clank)So overall I would give this game 10/5 stars, but since they won't let me I'll just have to give it 5.

First off, there are only four normal buttons to this controller, with one start button, no select button! Then there are huge L + R buttons, why are they so huge? Because the L + R buttons constantly break with the N64 and Super Nintendo controllers, so Nintendo redesigned the L + R buttons and made them spring loaded and big to take the pressure of little kids jamming the buttons with their fingers. Next there are two analog sticks, one on the top left and one on the bottom right for shooting games like the 007 games and A Perfect Dark games. For accurate game control there is an old fashioned directional pad at the bottom left.

The game is so much like MW2 that they can probably use the same Hack.ON THE PLUS SIDE*They did change up the Kill Streak system so it is better but still ridiculous.

I know they have dedicated servers but they are un-ranked and that's no fun.....sure maybe to just goof off a bit but that is about it.  If you like MW2 then you will like this one no hands down just because its practically the same with new maps and weapons but the gameplay is they same.I honestly don't know why they even tagged this game as MW3....They could have just came out with a few more map packs, then charged everyone $15 a piece for them, then did a expansion pack just like the Spec Ops expansion pack for BF2 and charged $30 for it.  Then you are up to $75 a customer.  They could have gotten more money and it would have been just as disappointing lol....Then while all this was going on they could have been building an actual MW3 game that wasn't a glorification of the last and THEN CHARGED $60 for it, and even if it was crappy people would still buy it.  But not this guy...I have been a huge fan of COD and I still play the crap out of COD4MW.  I also bought MW2 and logged many hours on it but the non dedicated servers is what destroyed this series for me when I was playing MW2.

It is an insult to our intelligence.  However, a girlfriend of mine thought it would be cute to purchase it for me since she knew I was into The Sims 2, but she didn't know any better and surprised me.After installing it, my pre-observation proved true.  Here is the rundown of what the Family Fun Stuff Pack offers simmers:1.  New music.  If you run the game off the FFSP disk, you can hear new musical scores at the load-up screen, but not elsewhere.2.  New clothes.  There are three everyday outfits of Hawaiian theme for each age group and gender to wear.  (Nice hula shirts and cargo shorts.)  The kids get new pajamas.  Whoopee.3.  New decorations.  Like ocean navigation?  You get some nice looking sailing motiffe stuff to hang on the walls or place on an endtable.  The best decoration, in my opinion, is the towel rack which I place in all my bathrooms.  The wallpaper additions are for kids only (medieval/dragons and underwater/sea life).4.  New furniture.  It's all kid stuff: dressers, beds, and lamps.  (Anyone who uses the floor coverings (under the Rugs tab) are creating a ridiculous room, I'll tell you that much.)The main problem with this Stuff Pack (SP) - besides the fact that all the material should have been included in the Open for Business expansion pack (EP) and NOT sold separately - is that you are extremely limited with what you are given.  In all reality, you will make two bedrooms and use up 90% of the items to do so.  Then you will wonder why you dropped $20 on such a rip-off perpetrated by the Maxis gang.If The Sims 2 wasn't such a solid game, I'd recommend a boycott.  Maybe just boycott the SPs and EPs.My only recommendation is that you purchase ZERO expansions and stuffs for The Sims 2 until The Sims 3 is released a couple years from now.  Then, when they offer ""The Sims 2 Complete Edition"" - which will include all their rip-off expansions and stuffs - you can buy it for $45 (guessing).

I realize it is a portable version and so there have to be some allowances made, but I am very disappointed that the ""kiddie"" controls are being so ridiculously abused by so many pathetic wannabes. There is the option to play with ""pro"" controls, and set your internet matches to play with like-minded enthusiasts, but whenever I tried to do that, I could find very few other players to battle with, so you're basically stuck playing these scrubs. You know who you guys are: Guile players taking advantage of the no-charge glitch, Zangief players who no longer have to perform his difficult double circle controller motions to pull off his 75% damage ultra. Blanka and Honda are probably the worst abused characters. They also have a no-charge type glitch, allowing players to do specials and recover from hits instantly. Those glitches coupled with Capcom's ""kiddie"" autoblock option makes some characters practically 100% unbeatable. Basically, what we end up with is a beautiful, fun game where you are required to fight 2 or 3 cheaters for every one fair match with someone who is more interested in fun than ringing up 20,000 battle points. Don't get me wrong, I've had alot of fun with this game... but I have also shut off in the middle of a match after playing 7 different E.

Bond must stop a mad industrialist from nuking the world, and has several gadgets and female friends to help him accomplish this. EA takes advantage of the Bond licence, as the game features Pierce Brosnan's face as Bond, the familiar Bond theme, appearances by classic Bond villains, and other goodies.But Nightfire lacks in several areas. First, the cool driving levels found in the console versions have been dropped from the PC version, probably due to lack of space. This leaves only 9 levels, which is just too short of a Bond experience. The game also seems to require a pretty high-end system to run.I have no problems running other recent games, such as Jedi Outcast, but Nightfire still stuttered along even when I set all the graphics options to low detail (and the graphics in Nightfire don't seem that spectacular in the first place). While I said EA takes advantage of the Bond licence, this isn't always a good thing. The Bond theme appears too often and quickly gets annoying, while the voice actor for Bond overplays his part and turns Bond into the stereotypical, cliched secret agent. Actual gameplay isn't too bad, but nothing special either. The levels are mostly non-interactive, small, and take too long to load (especially the Japanese resort level, where the game has to pause and load every few rooms, completely breaking up the gameplay). Finally, the game actually copies all of its cutscenes as AVI files onto your computer during installation. What's the point of playing the game when we can just watch the cutscenes, EA? Someone should have thought this out, and encoded the cutscenes as an unlockable extra, not give players free access to them even before they've seen the first level.If you have a PS2, Gamecube, or X-Box, get Nightfire for one of those instead, and not this inferior PC port.

While it's true that all the stuff you would want in a pirate game is present: buried tresure, swordfights, ship battles, land battles, etc. etc, each of these events are represented in their very own boring and most of the time, corny mini-game.Actually navigating your ship is really frustrating. I still haven't figured it out. The wind blows in a certain direction, and if you are not headed in that direction your ship moves at a snails pace. It takes forever to get from one end of the map to the other. The rest of the minigames are either really boring or just plain corny. For example, one minigame involves dancing to impress the Governor's daughter. Dancing around like a fancy boy is not what being a pirate is all about, let's get real. Ship battles are cool, but if your ship is somewhat far apart from your enemy it's VERY difficult to get close to them. For some reason in the ship battle mode your ship doesn't really move at all.The swordfighting is ok, but is pretty cheesy and gets boring very quickly while the land battles are excruciatingly slow. It's like moving chess pieces.

It features levels, skaters, and music from both games in HD using the Unreal Engine as a base. The lack of multiplayer on the PC version is disappointing, but the game is budget priced at $10 so fact it is not included is a pretty small complaint. The Unreal Engine runs the game fairly well, with only minor graphics issues and great looking levels. The challenges from the Campaign mode have been left intact giving the game a generous helping of nostalgia for the player. This is not the definitive version of either game though, and a lot of the issues come from sloppy programming; combos not working properly, falling from graphical glitches, and physics issues causing the player to be skyrocketed into the air when hitting a ledge wrong. It's a fun romp through some old content, but overall it just seems hastily done; especially when a well made version would have brought back a lot of life into this dead series. Don't go into this expecting the same feeling you got from playing the original, it just isn't going to happen. Newcomers should go into the game knowing it is no more than a simple HD cash-in at the nostalgia bank, but with no other skateboarding games to choose from it does it's job just fine.PROS:- Good amount of content for a budget price.- Levels look better than ever.- Some of the best levels from the first two games.- Gameplay is relatively smooth and feels similar to the original.- Soundtrack features some great tunes from the first and second game as well as some new ones.- Lots of upgrades and tricks to buy for each character.- Plays similar to the original games.- Campaign mode is fun and offers a lot of replay for each level.- Controller support as well as full keyboard support.CONS:- Player models are low poly count and look generally unpleasant.- Combo system sometimes drops current combo and starts a new one for no reason.- Hitting a ledge wrong can send your character skyrocketing into the air, wasting valuable time and looking ridiculous.- Lack of graphics options don't allow for much customization other than resolution.- Can no longer skip audio tracks if you don't like one.- Characters cannot be customized other than preset styles.- No multiplayer modes at all on the PC version.- DLC required to perform a revert.Conclusion:If you want a cheap trip down memory lane, or are just looking for a skateboarding game for your PC collection, this game will do the trick; just don't go into it expecting AAA title quality and features and you will come out satisfied.",3,Here it is: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD,1361577600,"02 23, 2013"

Better still, the original actors return to voice all four ghostbusters, even the token black one Winston. The original actress returns to voice the secretary, although she looks younger and hotter in the game. They even got the original actor to voice, Peck, their annoying antagonist. Bill Murray's brother voices the mayor and he looks like himself. You play a generic fifth rookie ghostbuster, who doesn't get a name or a voice.

You acquire money throughout the game for capturing or destroying ghosts, and can use that money for your upgrades. You should be able to purchase all your upgrades well before the game is over, after which money is useless.The game features the original theme music though not the whole cord, and not the song (no lyrics).This game can be enjoyed by kids and adults, and features a fair amount of humor. You will chuckle more then actually laugh. Difficulty on the normal setting is actually pretty challenging. However, the difficulty of certain parts is really sporadic, as most of the boss fights I found easy, where as some supposedly simple parts proved very difficult and took repeated tries. The hardest part of the game is near the end by a gate, and is ridiculously difficult.Fortunately the game saves your progress automatically at check points and there are many. Unfortunately you can't have saved games to just replay your favorite parts, and the although the checkpoints are usually well placed, some of them require you to go back through boring stuff you already did.The game is very linear and there are no choices to be made. At several points in the game you have the ability to wander around the station before going on your next mission. It's interesting the first time, but there is nothing to do there, and it's absolutely pointless.

In this one, The Captive Curse, Nancy travels to Germany to get to the bottom of another mystery. Castle Finister is being haunted by a legendary monster. Throughout this game, Nancy must snoop for clues, talk to four very interesting characters and find evidence to solve this mystery.I really enjoyed this game. The puzzles were much easier than the last game (Shadow at the Water's Edge), and with a new hint system on Nancy's phone, it's easier to obtain hints as to how to solve a puzzle. I also enjoyed the four different characters, ranging from a small child to an older woman, who all had a story to tell and as Nancy, we got to have interesting conversations with them. The castle itself looked beautiful and there was lots to explore!Overall, I think this game is a step in the right direction for Herinteractive, as it had the feel of the older games but it wasn't a rehash of what they'd done before.

I loved the original Force Unleashed, it had both stunning visuals, amazing force effects and a great story. This game to have great visuals and some good force effects, the problem is that there is hardly any story, for the simple reason of the game just being so extremely short. Now in the original part of the fun was unlocking all of the Apprentice's cool force powers, you sort of do some unlocking here to, but the game is just to short for any type of character development.Let me try to illustrate how short this game is. My and my hubby played through the entire game in 3 and a half hours, and let me tell you that we are not good players, we play for the story so a real gamer could probably do it in one and a half hours. Now I know what you are thinking with a storyline so short there have to be multi player, different game play modes, anything to make this game's entertainment value last for more than a few hours, well no there is not, there are a few challenges and a handful of trophies to unlock and that is it. When we finished this game and the credits begun to roll me and hubby actually tried to restart from the last checkpoint as we first believed there had to be some glitch, that it was not possible for a full prized Playstation 3 game to be this short, when we realized there where no glitch we just felt cheated. Yes that is right, I would go so far as to call this game a scam to harvest money of the popularity of the first game while providing no content for the second one.To be fair to the game I have to add that what there is of the game is good, the graphics are beautiful, the sort storyline is good, the controls work wonderfully and had this been a download off Playstation store or a budget title sold as a add on story to the first game then I would have had no problems with it, but that they dare to charge full price for this claiming that it is a full game, that is just an insult to players.If you can find this game very cheaply it might be worth having for the short but good story, or if you can find it for rent you might enjoy it. However be aware that this is not a full game. I have never seen a modern game this short, this game is an attempt to milk money out of fans of the first game while putting in minimal effort.

Sure it's awesome to blow away a heretic with a shotgun, but, slowly but surely flaws arise...as in, you move forward, a bit at a time, covering other units, but your teammates seem to consistantly shoot each other if they happen to be in each other's sectors of fire.

And then there are the few that you sit down and play through till it's done and then can't help but ask yourself, ""what the hell was that?"" Dark Void is that game.You play as Nathan Drake, as The Rocketeer. No, wait; you're Will, my mistake. It's so easy to confuse the two (damn you Nolan North. How about taking a little break before over exposure gets us all Northed out). The story takes place in the ever popular, rarely ever used in video games, World War II era. But there is a twist. You get sucked into the Bermuda Triangle and get thrown into another dimension where there is a war going on between the Survivors, humans who have gotten there the same way you have, and the Watchers, a sort of alien/robot species that once ruled over humans and who are trying to get back into the regular dimension to take control and enslave humanity once more.And that's about where I lost track of everything.Somewhere between bad story telling, mediocre third person shooter gameplay, and trying to not fall off cliffs and ledges to my death, I was starting to lose interest really fast. It's as if they wanted the gameplay to tell the story for them so they didn't bother introducing characters or explaining who and what. This is fine. But not when what you're doing is boring and slowly paced. That is, until you reach the later parts of the second half of the game. That's when someone pushes the Ludicrous Speed button and passes by the stuff that you were actually wanting to know.So why did I keep playing? Simple. I'm a sucker for flying. I love flying in games. That coupled with my love for the 1991 Disney movie The Rocketeer, Dark Void had an unfair grip on my jetpack ignition. Don't get it twisted, the flying is not the greatest, but if you need a fix and want to do some air combat then this will tie you over. They had some neat ideas when trying to put this game together, it's just too bad they were poorly executed. Like hijacking a UFO, which sounds like fun doesn't it? Well it was the first time. But doing it's drawn out button pressing over and over isn't exactly a good time. And then there's the ""which way is up? Oh, never mind, I just found this nice hard wall"" problem that kept popping up for me. If that wasn't when I was trying to follow something in the air, it was the kickback from initially turning the jetpack on where I'd go shooting off flailing in the air for a few seconds before I rocketed head first into a wall. Apart from a few annoyances, I can't complain about this aspect of the game because it is what I was looking forward to the whole time. I guess you can say I had fun with it. Sadly, those flying levels took up about 35%-40% of the game itself.The rest of the game you were on foot shooting different colored robots. This gameplay is what made me grow weary. It was playable, but there just didn't feel like there was any depth to it. And then you had this weird vertical cover system. Where you would rocket up to a ledge, and hang underneath it but not like you would think. You're crouched behind a vertical ledge in a very uncomfortable and unnatural looking position especially for someone with a jetpack on their back. And if you think that would mess with your head and cause you to go a little dizzy, trust me, you are spot on.In the end, it's hard to say go out and play this game. Because I for one would be happy never touching it again. Sadly, the ending leaves it wide open for a sequel. It's too bad you'll be left wondering what the hell just happened when the game ends, leaving that want and need for a sequel nowhere to be found. The story felt very slow and then very rushed with no happy medium. And the only part of it all that's enjoyable is a small percentage of the game as a whole. When it was over the smile on my face was priceless, because I knew that I can finally toss Dark Void into itself. (Get it? A dark v... nevermind.)Final Judgment,2.5 Water Bottles Full of Pee, out of 5Speaking of which, be careful after you play a lot of the flying levels and then go to pee.

2757,211764,A2CH7D7568YXJF,B009AGXH64,Sally,"[4, 4]","Let me start off by saying I am a long time Nintendo fan. I started out in the early 90's with an NES, followed by an N64, followed by the Wii, and now the Wii U.I love Nintendo for allowing backwards compatibility  on the Wii U and for allowing us to transfer our content from the original Wii onto the Wii U. I have to say this though, the instructions made it tough to transfer at first between the two consoles. I ended up having to go to a youtube video just to see how it was done and I finally managed to do it. Just make sure you have an SD card, as well as your original wii remotes ready (preferably 2 wii remotes if you have them. 1 will do the job, but that requires constant syncing and unsyncing between the Wii U and the original Wii console. If you have 2, then you just need 1 remote synced to each console, making it much easier and faster to transfer your content). Keep in mind, once you transfer your content, your original Wii is empty. Everything you did is now on the Wii U.Now, let's move onto the Gamepad. The gamepad is an interesting way to play. I personally did not think I would like the gamepad that much (I am very picky when it comes to controllers), but I actually do find it to be quite fun to play on. Some games, like Nintendo land, have you use it a lot. Then there are others, such as Super Mario U, that give you the option to use the gamepad or the original Wii Remote. With Nintendo Land, you can do fun things such as tilt the remote to move your character around. Then there are others that allow you to use the gamepad to look around, almost giving you that full 3D effect in a sense. It's definitely different from any other console out there!Furthermore, the gamepad makes navigation a lot easier in comparison to the original Wii. On the original Wii, typing on the keyboard required you to use the wii remote to point at each letter on the TV screen (this was a pain in the behind because it was such a slow process!!!). Now, on the Wii U, the keyboard is on your gamepad, allowing you to select each letter the same way you would on a tablet. This makes navigation so much quicker and a lot less frustrating!The TVii is a good tool to have as well. I have not played around with it too much yet (I rarely watch TV these days anymore), but I have checked it out. I do enjoy the TV guide they provide for you on the Gamepad, allowing you to scroll through it and select a particular show you want to watch. If you already have a TV guide on your TV to begin with though, then you probably won't be as amazed by this feature because you already have it. Personally, for me, I love it because we are old school in my house. We just have regular cable with no guide, so having it on the Wii U gamepad is really useful for me.Also, similar to the original Wii, you still have Netflix, Hulu Plus, Youtube, etc. Again, these things are FAR more easier to navigate thanks to the keyboard on the gamepad now.One thing that disappoints me so far is the lack of games. I currently play two games: Nintendo Land and Super Mario U. No other games really interest me at this moment, but I do hear they are in the process of making them later on in the year, which is good news. You can either be an early bird like me and get this console now, so that way you are all set and prepared for the new releases in the fall. Or you can hold off and just wait until the titles are available before buying the console. I personally like to be prepared ahead of time, so that way I'm not forking up all my money at once, but that is just me.Lastly, I want to talk about MiiVerse. This was another feature that I did not think I would use much, but I actually find myself posting quite a bit on there. MiiVerse is a way for you to connect with anyone worldwide. You can share comments, start discussions, give each other tips on how to beat a level, etc. You can even draw and post your drawings. I have hand written messages on there, as well as typed messages, and some drawings. The pen that comes with the gamepad makes drawing very easy and fun. You can draw just as good as if you were using a pen on paper. It is that accurate!Overall, the Wii U is a great console! As I said, it just needs more games, but the games will come as time passes. What we have now are just the launch titles. So again, either hold off and wait for the games to come, or get yourself the Wii U console now and just play your original Wii games on it until more Wii U games come out.",4,"Love it, but it needs more games",1370390400,"06 5, 2013"

The game continually reminds the child that a certain character or type of character is better for the task they are performing.

Game play is pretty intuitive and (as other Spyro games have) skews to a younger player. My 7 year old loves the game but my 12 year old was quickly bored. Figures cannot be shared between users, the game's progress is stored on the figure. I would suggest the best additional purchase would by the adventure packs. Both kids thought some of the areas opened by adventure packs were more entertaining than the main game. After playing for about a month the older child has completely lost interest in the game but my younger child is saving every nickel to spend on additional figure packs.

How can such a thing be possible without becoming a mind-numbing, repetitive grind?  Answer: it cannot.Not that you have to get that high, but my point is, if you think that many levels is some kind of good thing, you and I have nothing in common, and you might as well stop reading right now.This is actually one of the very few games I've ever traded in.  I just couldn't see myself ever inserting the disc again after the first few days.  The gameplay is silly, the story is silly, the voice acting is ... well, it's actually decent.  But I don't buy games for the voice acting alone.The ""innovative"" lift-and-throw feature is interesting the first couple of times, but once you learn how to exploit it all the time, it becomes more of a chore, like something you're being forced to do instead of something fun.  Same with the ludicrous geo-color-nonsense.  Yes, you CAN kill everything on the screen with it, but how is that engaging or immersive?  To me, it just makes everything ridiculously simple, and it gets old fast.And the bit about leveling up items?  Ugh.  Seriously, I cannot be bothered.  Not fun.If you like RPGs that have a good story punctuated with truly strategic battles that actually make you think, if you are looking for a challenge and accept that you might actually lose a tough battle, or if you care at all about rules that make some kind of realistic sense, do NOT buy this game.If, on the other hand, you like to powerlevel your dudes and easily pwn everything on the map in every fight with the same repetitive set of strategies, and if you think unsubtle sexual innuendo and jokes about bodily functions are the height of humor, this game is totally for you.",1,"Not that great, actually",1231200000,"01 6, 2009"

Well, I didn't pay list price, and feel like I definitely got good value for the $ spent.I haven't seen the movie, so the whole story was new to me. There's a bit of a lesson, as is commonly the case in Disney/Pixar products. The heroine is extremely capable and meets & conquers challenges.There are some puzzles/mini-games--all pretty easy (slider puzzles, Simon-type mini-games, pipe connecting puzzles).There are loads of enemies to defeat, but the heroine has skills, weapons and armor that make those battles readily winnable. There are 7 levels each of armor, bow and sword. The upgraded versions are discovered in yellow-trimmed treasure chests that are scattered thru the levels.Golden orbs and health-restoring potions are found in red-trimmed treasure chests and after defeating enemies. Collect the orbs to buy upgrades for skills. Upgrades are available between levels.Levels are short, so save points are not an issue. If you do quit the game in mid-level, you start from the beginning of that level.No regrets on my purchase...enjoyed it!

1565,200122,A2B5G0HOXSVV5N,B007C72F2U,H. N. T.,"[7, 8]","I loved Civilization from the first game.  I even tried Call to Power, but couldn't do it.Civ 5 clearly simplified too much, I must assume they wanted to increase the pontential number of players, but I don't see how the regular Civ 5 could please anyone.So now the idea is to introduce again Religion and Espionage into the game and (hopefully) some added complexity to the game. It does succeed at that, but at a much smaller level than the previous success of Civilization IV.Religion was made into an interesting innovation; you basically tailor your religion to your strategy by choosing which benefits it confers.  For example you can receive benefits for having the religion spread into different civilizations, or simply by the number of cities (your or others) affected, or the ability to buy building with the new faith points.  Pretty neat, and since a particular benefit can be interesting there is a sort of a race if two civilizations want to pursue the same strategy.The downside is that once the religions are established, there is little gameplay with them.  So they change the game from the beginning to say... 500 AD.  By them mostly everyone will have  a religion picked out.  It was a fine addition, but it mostly changed the early game in a relatively minor way.Espionage is the big let down.  It begins in the Renaissance (it is as if the game knew religion would be mostly played out by then) and you get one spy to try to steal tech or influence city-states.  Far too little gameplay and involvement, the spy doesn't exist on the map and it all happens in the ""Espionage screen"".  It is a cheap add on that does nothing to the game and is absurdly limited.  You get one new spy per age, so you can't move resources into more spies because basically they have very little to actually do.The greatest success is actually naval combat.  Now you have long range and melee ships, and you can attack cities more effectively with a navy. Naval combat was drastically improved with this.The new civs are irrelevant to me.  I don't care about new luxury items.  The foreign policy is very mildly different for city states, but the original one was practically broken, so I see this more as a patch than an effective expansion of the game.So this expansion is ok, but not worth the price.  It improves mildly Civ5, but it still is incredibly inferior to Civ4 in every way but graphics.",3,"Better, but still behind Civ IV.",1345939200,"08 26, 2012"

Civ III lacks many of the key technological improvements of Civ II (no rail so you always use the same roads that you built in 3000 BC and no improvments in agriculture) that makes the game less fun.

Of course with expectations as high as they are for this game, the potential for dissapointment is equally high. So does MW2 deliver? Well, it does but I would be trying to hide the sky with my thumb if I didn't address some issues that keep me from giving this game 5 stars.Graphics - Playing the original Modern Warfare, I remember thinking that graphics couldn't get any better. Some of that assessment has a lot to do with the fact that it was one of the first games I played on my then-brand-new PS3 and was just discovering the new generation's graphical potential. However, the game looked awsome. So I was pleasantly surprised by the upgrade in this area. The game looks so much better. Colors, detail, smoothness... It is just plain better. There some moments where there is simply too much going on and you will encounter some chop but nothing significant.Gameplay - Here is where the game displays some shotcomings. There really is nothing new here. Controls and mechanics are exactly the same as the last game. It does not have to mean that is a bad thing but one can expect Activision to at least try something new. In that regard there is a new feature in some parts of story mode where you breach doors or walls and going in, everything slows down (like in the movies). I thought it was pretty cool but others might not like it. The action is pretty intense and gives you even more of a sense of being in the middle of it all. This is where the previous game truly shone and it remains so. The areas you play are vast and varied. For my money the gem in the game is the scenes that take place in the United States. The suburban setting in Virginia and the war zone in Washington D.C. took my breath away. The attention to detail was amazing. It was really fun(and scary) to avoind enemy fire by taking cover in fast food restaurants and gas stations. The D.C. scene is just as incredible as it looked in the commercial. I give Activision big kudos for thinking outside the box on this one. Many might find such things contrversial or downright offensive but when you come dowright to it it is a game and if you are going for realistic, the ultimate reality of war is that there are no rules.Story - In MW I thought the story mode was too short so you can imagine what I think of it now! I am married with kids and responsabilities and even I was able to play through this one three (short) sittings. I can understand that many people pick up this game for the online content, which id generally where the most replay value is but I think Activision can do a much better job here, especially considering the storyline which to say the least is a bit convulted. There was really more than enough in the story to warrant a longer game. The storyline was a little hard to follow and it is difficult for the player to immerse himself in the game. This has a lot to do with the fact you play as several characters in the game and two of them die in the process. Focusing on one character would go a long way in improving this. On the flip side, the story tries to play the, well, modern aspeccts of warfare and politics in that there really is no absolute good or evil and the game is constantly treading in a gray area. This game features a particular chapter that you can choose to skip called ""No russian"". I'm not going to go into detail here as I don't want to ruin anyone's experience but yes, the scene can be a bit disturbing at first but it plays right into the themes I was talking about before. It plays very much like a movie and it helps the player get into the game which is, in my opinion one of the places the game is lacking.Special Ops - New feature were you complete several objectives and get a star grading based on you performence. Some of these are played online with a friend. I am really enjoying playing this feature. The main reason being this: Those who have played this game series know the incredible night/day difference between playing story mode vs. playing online. I find Special Ops to be somewhere in the middle. If you need a good primer before heading into the frontline hell that is mutliplayer, this is perfect. You can improve your skills without going through the humiliation of being completely destroyed or being used for point fodder in multiplayer. Because the objectives in Special Ops are time and point-based, you get to develop you speed and reflexes to a level decent enough to be competent in ""the real world"". If this was available when I played MW1 it would have saved me a lot of frustration.Multiplayer/Online - This is the reason most people play this game. my brother for example hasn't played a minute in story mode but lord knows what his ranking is online. I don't want to know. MW2 features all that made the previous one great and adds a ton of stuff in the form of bonuses. I am yet to get a grip on it all as virtually anything you do in this mode earns you XP. The areas are huge and there is plenty of hiding, ambush and surprise places to keep you busy till rapture. Of course, the quality of the gameplay depends mostly on who is playing with you. This new version will become the standard in online console fps just as Modern Warfare was when it came out.Hopefully someone will figure out how to let XBL players battle PSN players. Now that would be a war!Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is an awsome game but its engine and premise are starting to show their age. A new installment will probably require a complete and total re-make but as it stands, one could argue that you can't find a more complete, engaging or powerful gameplay experience in a console fps on PS3.

Also, I don't like having to set the PS Vita flat on the desk surface because it could potentially scratch the rear touchscreen.- Watching Netflix (the cradle creates a perfect angle for watching movies) while waiting for game patches/installs on my PS3, or when taking a break from it (even though I could just watch Netflix on the PS3, it's easier to just have Netflix open on the PS Vita while I can have a game on the PS3).- Checking my trophy list and not having to pick up the PS Vita every time I check it. The cradle makes an excellent viewing angle. On the PS3, it takes a while for the trophy list to load up (and MUCH longer when there's a game running). This makes it so I can check my trophies and have the game open without the XMB screen in the way.The one negative I've found so far is when the PS Vita is on the cradle, you have to hold the top or back of the PS Vita when you press the PS button on the Vita, otherwise it moves the would thing.It would be neat if the PS logo on the cradle itself were a secondary PS button for the Vita when the Vita is on the cradle.

Needless to say, the graphics are stunning and you won't get better visual effects in any other racing games. From my perspective, the sound tracks are not very important because when I race I usually focus on the sound of engine revs, but I know this is not the case for the majority. Controls are the same as before, no surprise here. I only use dualshocks to play, but I feel like if I have the G25/27 steering wheel and pedals it'll be a lot easier. Some complain about driving physics, but I think it's pretty accurate for the cars I know. I owned an Integra-GSR and WRX STI in real life and now drives a Z4 M Coupe, all three cars perform pretty much the way I expected. The M Coupe oversteers like mad in game when traction control is off, especially when you apply gas in corners, which is pretty much the same as my car in real life lol. A new feature like Travel Mode allows you to take a photo of your cars around the world. Completing some Special Events unlocks some more places to travel. This mode has full feature of a typical digital SLR. It's quite fun to mess with if you like photography, but it's just icing on the cake to me and I can simply do without.1. Arcade Mode:Like the previous GT series, Arcade Mode let you pick a track and a car to start the race. Good for casual gamers who want to avoid tough challenges.2. Racing in GT Mode:In GT Mode, you've got A-spec, B-spec, Special Events, and License Tests.A-spec is as fun as the previous series. Before the race, it allows you to look at what your competitors are driving to get a feel of what tuning you'll need for your car. As some might have mentioned, they should have put a restriction on how much you can tune for each race so that you don't overpower your opponents too much. It's frustrating to overspend my credit on tuning and pass all my opponents in a few turns. You have the option to not equip certain items to make it more challenging, but it'll be nicer if retrictions are enforced. Another thing is, if you find out you don't have a qualified car to race, there is no shortcut to the dealerships that highlight the makes and models that are qualified. You'll need to memorize what types of car you'll need, quit all the way to the main menu, go to dealerships, then look for a qualified car under each brand.As for B-spec, you get to create virtual drivers and you'll watch them race and command them. This feature can go away in the future since no one wants to buy a racing game just to watch the computer drive. After trying once, I already decide not to waste any more time playing B-spec. Unfortunately, B-spec occupies 40% of the races in GT Mode. Could you imagine how many more fun races we could have if there were no B-spec to begine with? Big failure on their part.Most of the Special Events are extremely challenging, and by the time you earn a gold in each event (if you have the patience), your in-game racing skills will surely be enhanced. The Special Events are probably too much to handle for many. You have to really enjoy driving in the best lines and knowing where to accelerate and slow down to fully appreciate it.Ah! the License Tests! If you think they were tough in GT4, think again! I haven't spent too much time earning licenses so I can't comment much, but I assure you it's super tough to earn gold.3. New Online Features in GT Mode:I was going to rate this game 3 stars because of the lack of solid online features. But as of yesterday when I updated the patch to 1.05. It opens up more doors to the online community.First, the Open Lobby was underconstruction but it's now very alive. I joined some random room and played with some random folks yesterday and it was a whole lot of fun although I had to deal with trolls who drove backward and sideway. You can also do text and voice chat in each room. You'll gain credits and experience points from playing.Second, a new feature called Seasonal Events allows players to compete in GT5 official events such as time trials with set restrictions on car models and tuning.Third, another new feature is Online Dealership. Its interface is same as the Used Car Dealership that let you to find some new and old rare cars. I was finally able to find a Japanese car that was made before 79 to compete in the A-spec Japanese Classics Championship.Conclusion:This game is a must have for all GT fans. The -1 star is due to some flaws in user interface and that terrible B-spec. However, the pros definitely overshadow the cons. I'd recommend this game to anyone who have passion for cars.",4,"Great Game, But With Flaws",1293062400,"12 23, 2010"

6763,95833,AY551XJWQIW9A,B000X9FV5M,"C. Smith ""otherthani""","[200, 244]","Id like to preface my review by stating that in no way has my opinion of the game been swayed by the DRM used for piracy protection by Ubisoft. This review is solely in regards to the gameplay itself.With my pure enjoyment of Far Cry and Crysis, I was extremely excited about the release of this game. Unfortunatly when I began playing the game, I became more and more disappointed as I played. In fact, if it werent for the graphics, this would easily be considered an instant bargin bin title.I have so many gripes about this game that Im not quite sure where to begin, so I will start with my biggest one... the firefights. You have so much against you from the very beginning that it is extremely difficult to find them enjoyable. In fact you feel as though you are being punished just for taking the mission. Your gun will continuously jam. You have malaria, so in the middle of a gunfight you may need to pop a pill to get over it (everything turns yellow and fuzzy). If your health gets low (and it will... continually from all the sharpshooters they have in Africa) you must first pull the bullet out, then.. you must heal yourself. I must ask... why?? I suppose it was to add tension, but only succedes in being frustrating. You will die often... not because you get overwhealmed by the (incredibly stupid) AI, but because of a gun jam, having to heal yourself with a two step process or because you get a malaria outbreak.As I get off that rant, I invite you to another. Lets investigate the whole ""sandbox, free roam, open world..."" direction in which the developers decided to take with this sequel. First off the compass is horrible and the map is even worse. Not because they are a bad concept... they work extremely well in GTA and games of the like. The problem is, your objective is sooooo far away that even when you pull out your map, because it isnt a full map, all you see is the general direction you are supposed to be going and not able to pinpoint the best route to take or where exactly your objective is. This is compounded by the fact that you hit several checkpoints (more on these later) that ensue a ""forced"" firefight... and I believe I already explained how much fun they are. It will take you at least 10 minutes to get from point A to point B because of this. Rediculous.Now, remember the checkpoints. These lovely roadblocks are apparently set up by guerillas (no... not gorillas) who attack you when you come close. I guess that makes sense, however, the frustrating part is after you destroy a checkpoint, they respawn so every time you drive by, you get attacked again and again and again. If you try to blast through in your vehicle, a car chase ensues.... sounds like fun right? Wrong, because no matter how fast you are going, they magically appear behind you and if they shoot your vehicle 3 or 4 times, it stalls. And I bet you thought the engine was in the front of the vehicle. So, because of this you end up getting out of your vehicle and... you guessed it, a firefight begins... malaria.... damn... gun jammed... shot need health... pull out the bullet... use medi.... dead.Finally the vehicles themselves. For some reason, the geniuses at Ubisoft only give a 1st person view of driving... so you try to drive, look at map and compass at the same time and because the vehicle handles so poorly you hit a boulder and the vehicle stalls out, so you get in front of the vehicle and fix it. Get back in and hit a lovely checkpoint further up.There are several other nuances in the game like no checkpoints... well theres lots of those, but I mean autosave points... so hit F5 ALOT or your 10 minute trip from point A to point B can take you 30 minutes. There isnt really much of a story here to be found either, so you really just find yourself doing side missions... even the main missions seem like side missions which dont give you much of a feeling of accomplishment.I realize I have been on quite a rant, and most of my reviews are not as negative or sarcastic as this. As a matter a fact I dont think I have given a single star review to anything before... but this game definitly deserves it. As I attempt to leave with a positive remark, I am at a loss. I could mention the graphics, however theyre really not better than the original Far Cry... and I can max them out on my machine.I was extremely disappointed and feel my $60 was just wasted. Ive played the game for about 11 hours, and cannot bring myself to finish it... and thats an extreme rarity for me.

I have played through this game's entire campaign and I think it is highly underrated, even quite unfairly maligned.  Is it perfect?  No.  In fact, after a rather strong start, there are many elements of the game that become progressively and disappointingly sloppy as the campaign goes on.  But I'll get to those in a moment.Aliens: Colonial Marines spent five (maybe six) years in development.  I can't deny, after such a long time, that one would probably expect a stronger game to have emerged.  But even after the incalcuable number of horrific reviews came in following the game's launch, my longtime fandom of the Aliens series was not going to permit me to avoid giving it a try.  I launched into the campaign expecting the worst, and I was immediately impressed by the incredible amount of love and detail that went into Gearbox's recreation of the Sulaco, and tension I felt as I gradually started getting attacked by aliens in very effectively lit enviornments.  As you progress through the first three missions, which culminate in the epic destruction of the Sulaco, the game really grips you.Landing on LV-426, though, I quickly forgot about the fact that the Hadley's Hope colony was supposed to have been utterly destroyed in the film, because the surface of the planet and the colony's interior are so lovingly and beautifully reproduced in this game that you can't help but delight in exploring them and reliving that experience.  As you have to defend the operations center from attacking waves of aliens, and eventually travel into the previously unseen depths of the colony on other missions, the game does a great job of keeping the tension ratcheted up in intimidating, alien-infested enviornments that are astoundingly detailed and brilliantly lit.  The feeling of actually experiencing the film from a first-person perspective in pretty impeccable, in my opinion.Once you get about halfway through the game, however, things abruptly start to look more sloppy and unfinished.  The cinematic cutscenes in particular really became choppy and painful to watch.  The character animations and textures are downright ugly, and the script starts losing direction as the story heads into territory that it's not sure how to justify or explain.  I won't detail any spoilers here, but a few head-scratching narrative calls are definitely made.  The quality of the campaign remained pretty consistent, though, and the real highlight of the game (for me) came in FINALLY being able to get up close to the mysterious derelict and explore its interior, which has, since the events of Aliens, been converted into a Weyland-Yutani research facility.  This is something I have ALWAYS wanted to see, so I'm pleased that Gearbox went that route.  Unfortunately, this is also where some of the campaign's visual glitches started to become more pronounced.  There is actual visual tearing in a number of enviornments, and the entire screen goes wavy at times.  This is pretty unbelievable.  But, they are temporary scars on a larger experience that is absolutely worth having.There were many complaints about the A.I. of both your allies and enemies in this game.  To be sure, your allies do like to run ahead of you at almost all times, frequently alerting you in advance to incoming enemies, which really has an impact on the tension and suspense that the game is supposed to deliver.  I expected from the reviews that there would be a large number of aliens in this game that generally didn't attack and would sit happily waiting to be blown up.  Perhaps this issue was patched in a software update, because I didn't experience it... much.  Yes, it DOES happen sometimes, but not often enough to break the final product.  It's one of those things you have to view as a temporarily amusing glitch in an otherwise pretty well-crafted experience.  The aliens' most irritating behavior is frequently running right past your squadmates to home in specifically on you, and when they engage your allies, they usually seem unable to dispatch them until you come to their aid with all guns blazing.  In the end, it makes your allies seem more like window dressing than any kind of actual help, unlike the kind of squad A.I. you're given in, say, a game like Mass Effect.So, that may be what Aliens: Colonial Maries boils down to for some people... weighing the pros against the cons.  I, for one, enjoyed myself pretty thoroughly from start to finish.  I could fault Gearbox for a rather unsatisfying final non-battle against an Alien Queen, or the astoundingly, infuriatingly anticlimactic non-ending that they wrote into the game's closing cinematics (which I'm hoping the newly-released DLC, ""Statis Interrupted,"" will make a point of addressing to some extent).  But when all is said and done... after I finished the game, I promptly started re-playing all the different campaign missions in search of missed item pickups and achievements.  And my overall enjoyment of the game continued unabated.  I haven't tried out the multiplayer mode yet, since the campaign has been keeping me busy, but I doubt a lot of people are playing it anyway due to all the toxic word of mouth this game has received.I think that Aliens: Colonial Marines is a lovingly crafted and very enjoyable Aliens experience that unquestionably falls short in some areas, but hits more sweet spots than it misses.  If you're a longtime Aliens fan like me, I feel confident that you'll find more to appreciate here than to despise.  Maybe all the negative reviews will lower your expectations enough to actually surprise you with the general quality of the finished product.  Maybe you'll hate it all the same.  But if you're an Aliens fan, and you're not the kind of unforgiving, self-righteous sourpuss who lets every little imperfection completely break the game for you, then I think you owe it to yourself to at least give it a try.  You just might be pleasantly surprised.",4,Unfairly Lambasted,1374537600,"07 23, 2013"

Mega Man speeds to the rescue of his city and meets a new robot named Bass, whose origin and objective are unclear initally but through a major plot twist, Wily's plan comes full circle.  Here's the lowdown on Mega Man's first adventure on the SNES:THE GOODThe level designs are pretty good by standard.  We get some interesting new bosses including Shade Man and Turbo Man (Shade Man's music rocks and his stage reminded me of Castlevania).  The Rush adaptors from MM6 are mashed into one Rush adaptor here that allows temporary flying and a unique &quot;buster&quot; in which Mega Man throws his fist at the enemy!  There is also a new Rush function called &quot;Rush Search&quot; in which Rush can find hidden items (including the EXIT option).  I also loved how this game connected with MM6.THE BADThe sprites in this game, particularly Mega Man's, is funky.  The music is mostly subpar with only a handful of tunes that are memorable, and the sound effects sound like they came off of a game boy!  While the level designs were alright, Mega Man's sprite is just too damn big for the levels and this goes against manuvering.  Proto Man also doesn't do much but give advice here and I wished he was given more game time (that doesn't come til MM8).  Like MM6, this game seems like it was rushed... and it is the rarest Mega Man game known to man.OVERALLWhile this game holds onto many qualities that the series has, it has many factors going against it.  If Capcom had spent more time on the game before its release, it would've probably been a great Mega Man game.  Alas, it didn't come out too well.  My suggestion: only get it if you are a Mega Man fan, AND get it for a reasonable price.  It's not a gamer's heaven, unfortunately.",3,A major letdown.,1059177600,"07 26, 2003"

The reality is this is a series that overwhelmingly depends on player choice forming the story line. Abandoning that dynamic at the end of the series makes the entire exercise pointless. That said the only thing this series really has going for it is the story telling. Once you remove that or look beyond the fantasy. What you are left with is at best a very mediocre shooter, or a outright anemic attempt at a role playing game. With an absurd amount of time sinks which have no real entertainment value.There are simply better options to avail yourself of in either genre. Mass Effect 3 as a shooter takes turns at being maddening, and yet tedious at the same time. The combat is based around a cover system married to a shield based system. Meaning that combat can be underwhelming. Except for the times when the controls cause mishaps like jumping cover, saddling up to the side of cover, or gasp walking away from cover randomly. That would be bad on the whole, but it can become infuriating in some scenarios where overpowered enemies are thrown at you, or worse you contend with a endless drill of them. So you will go through hours of mind numbing repetition only to find yourself getting hung up in a arena like area for upwards of an hour.On the role playing side of the equation the situation is even bleaker. The entire system is based around making tradeoffs that equal out regardless of your play style. Meaning that you only have the appearance of choice. Even then it boils down to a choice of A or B. This applies equally for skills and equipment. There is just no room for thought, or individualization. It really speaks to a contempt for the player. This developer isn't known for having a comprehensively deep system, but this is about as shallow as the pool gets. With two previous outing in this series. It should have seen marked improvement, but in the end it has actually gotten much worse.To summarize you have a story development based game which not only gets castrated at the end, but is also just plain unabashed about ripping other franchises off. It isn't homage when you rip entire scenes from movies, and television series. So the story is pretty pathetic regardless of whether your choices matter or not. Other then that you just have a very weak shooter with some pointless role playing elements tacked on top for I guess some kind of nostalgia purpose.About all that can be said for the game is that it isn't utterly horrible. It is playable even if the elements in part or whole are entirely unremarkable. You will get about thirty hours out of this title with little to no real replay value.

They have ranged from brilliant to mediocre like this latest installment. So I'm sure you're wondering where this game went wrong. Well, before I get in to all of that I'll start with the few positives about this game. There is a part of the game where the player can witness a murder in reverse; the game's main character can walk into the scene of a movie while it's playing,  additionally the last boss is interesting in design and battle. It is unfortunate though that these positives are overshadowed by all of the bad.The game begins harmless enough with the game's title being displayed across the screen then the cheese factor begins when a series of lame screams are played over and over again. Seriously, who thought that was a good idea? When the player gets tired of listening to these annoyingly lame screams and hits the start button to spare their eardrums they will find that they are confronted with even more screams.  This isn't scary in any way, it's actually very irritating.Once the gameplay begins the player immediately encounters some incredibly jarring lagging.  Yes, it is noticeable enough and frequent enough to be distracting.The monster designs are also uninspired save for the last boss which deserves some measure of praise. The other monsters range from an unstoppable red void (yawn), two prisoner types, dolls, screamers (which are basically female zombies) wall corpses, and something called a weeping bat (yes, it's as ridiculous looking as the name implies).These things compounded with a dull storyline, lack of atmosphere, boring characters, poor soundtrack , and the main character screaming like a little girl all of the time (which seems like a strange thing to have a prisoner who's been incarcerated for several years do unless he's a punk which seems 90% likely).Also the over abundance of puzzles doesn't help this game it actually hurts it.  Most of the puzzles are so random they seemed to have been tossed in to increase the game's length. This randomness with the puzzles pulls one out of the experience and reminds the player that they are playing a game, a bad game.All of these unfortunate elements make this game not scary in the least which is an insult to the Silent Hill name and the survivor horror genre.

The slightest pressure on a key activates but I had many times where I released a key IMO and it still acted as if in the down state.  The Cherry red or Blues for MX switches would of been better I never will buy black MX switches again. These switches seemed not as good as other MX switches they failed to make noise or a sense of pressure you can feel which is whole point of MX switches.Bad or Horrible Things:Software: Terrible, First the keyboard came with no software. BTW also NO instructions other than to tell you to go onto the internet.  The software only maps the Keys on the right hand side.  You can't do anything without software far as I can tell.Firmware: Terrible, The firmware destroyed the keyboard basically tells you to plug the keyboard into the back of computer and then run firmware update from Corsair. FYI: site also failed several times for download.  I ran the firmware software it said updated successfully. Then I clicked OK.  After that the keyboard flashed then all I could do was type letters all my AUDIO, G-Keys, and DIM switches basically didn't function, I bricked it. I tried to re-flash it thinking it worked like any modern device in last 5 years, nope failed said ""Failed to Find Flash"" or something to that nature.  I put in a support ticket with Corsair since the only piece of paper in the box says don't send this back put in support ticket. Emailing the problem. No reply. I waited as the site stated for 3 business days.  Now over 2 weeks. No email. Now sending keyboard back to Amazon since the manufacture doesn't respond.Support: Non-Existent for Email.  No Reply.Instructions: None.  The worst is they tell you go to website. Once on that website it has no instructions just a download of program and a shopping site for manufacture. Program doesn't tell you what keys even do for example (MR-Key) I don't know if that's a way to record without the software.The keyboard as a programmable keyboard is useless.  If you have to use that software all the time to record G keys on the left. If anybody knows how to not use software leave instructions below because the keyboard didn't come with software or instructions on how to use it.Also I wanted the W to do something like a macro. I wanted Shift held down and W when I was pushing W, I can't do that with software.All I can do is program G1 to hit shift key then hit W but not hold shift and W at same time.Even if I got it to do that it would be inconvenient since G1 is farther out of reach than Shift+W.  Hench unless your going to do a complicated script from the far left of your keyboard and hit those keys the macro feature is almost worthless cause even a $14 keyboard you can do a better macro.  If as they mention in their video you can take it with you that is worth something however I bricked my keyboard with firmware updates.I am getting a replacement directly from Amazon but am worried about that firmware and really considering about taking a hit on shipping but send it all back.

The gunplay is much easier than that found in TR 2013 (Indeed, the gunplay in ANY TR game prior to the 2013 release is easy), but the grappling was a bit ""glitchy,"" although it worked.Two of the most difficult battles I have played in the TR series are found here -- one in Japan -- and the very last one in the game, the battle with ""The Amanda Beast.""  This last battle was the most difficult battle in all of the TR games, including Lara's battle with the ONI WARRIOR GIANT (and company!) in TR 2013.  The very long motorcycle battle and lightning-fast episode in the Khazakstan section was tiring, if only because it went on and on and on.The graphics and voice-overs were excellent and Lara's costumes were, to say the least, fetching.Some complain that this version of TOMB RAIDER was too short!  What do they want?  There were several subdivided localesof interest here:  Peru, Bolivia, Ghana, Japan, Khazakstan, Nepal, Croft Manor, and finally, more Bolivia, and, except for Croft Manor, the player spends considerable time in all of the other locales, including the final area (And don't go telling me that you killed the AMANDA BEAST in 5 minutes, because I won't believe you!).And so, because of the sheer excitement involved with Lara's dangerous adventures in all of these beautiful countries, replete with Buddhist monasteries, ice caves, shelves, slides, and mountains, not to mention Japanese skyscrapers, fast-moving railroad trains, and man-eating tigers, leopards, and snow leopards, I gave this beautiful game 5 stars because it deserves it!

Like another reviewer, I really wanted to like this game. I bought it based on my blind faith in Bethesda, and was hoping for an open architecture gaming universe like Oblivion, but I couldn't have been more disappointed.The single player campaign is a tightly choreographed, scripted series of linear missions. No deviations from the missions are allowed, you cannot explore the universe, and you cannot truly customize your fleet. Yes, you can buy & sell different types of vessels for your fleet of 4, but you cannot customize your ships (with extra shields or weapons, etc), you cannot choose captains based on their style, and you can't even rename your ships (if that's something thats important to you).The graphics are beautiful, and the controls are fine with practice, but the single player campaign is about 70% cinematics and 30% gameplay. Sure, it's entertaining to watch once, hearing the original captains voices is a plus, but gameplay is constantly interrupted during and in between missions with long cinematic sequences.The game is fun, but it's not great. I was hoping for Oblivion in space, where I could go off on my own to explore and pick up various assignments and achievements in a non-linear, open end gaming experience. Sadly, the single player game is essentially warp, fight, repair, warp, fight, repair, with some special objectives thrown in for variety.Bethesda really let me down on this one.

Even after paying only $15 for this game I felt ripped off.Graphically the game is lacking. I understand it's a launch title but the design of the whole thing was so sterile and lackluster it's not even worth looking at. The 3D was well done, especially with the airplane. The inclusions of Miis was a disappointment to me. I know that this is an area where it's personal preference, but the Miis need an overhaul. They are so generic at this point, I really wish they would've updated them to be more detailed for the 3DS. The inclusion of your Mii in this game makes already dull scenery even worse.The controls are well done. Each type of aircraft has its own feel and controls are responsive and well mapped out.Gameplay is fun for about half an hour. Woohoo island is WAY too small and only helps the game lose its appeal faster. You can only fly around the same tiny island so many times before you're ready to take out the cartridge and put it back in the case.

4474,42475,A3S8H5I0A9M2YP,B0000ALBWU,"Brian T. Hayes ""ravenAMP""","[8, 14]","First of all, let me be direct, Metal Gear is my favorite series in gaming history every since Metal Gear Solid for the Playstation.  It's intricate plot, realistic characters, gameplay, and music rivals all games of all genres on nearly any level.Now, allow me to explain that while this game has yet to come out I have already allocated it five stars.In the first Metal Gear Solid (MGS),  you play out as the legendary hero of ""Outer Heaven"" (Metal Gear), agent Solid Snake.  You are sent in from the U.S. government to Shadow Moses, Island Alaska to quell a terrorist insurrection at a Nuclear Disposals Facility.  As you make your way past genetically enhanced guards and fight members of your old unit, Foxhound, you hear of the return of one of the Military's greatest black projects, Metal Gear: a nuclear equiped bipedal vehicle capable of launching undetectable nuclear warheads at anywhere in the world and it's been seized by the terrorists!  Filled with treachery, deception, love, rivalry, revenge, sniping, shooting, demolitions, Metal Gear Solid is perhaps the pinnacle of games/stories to ever hit a console system in the world.Then there was Metal Gear Solid 2: The Sons of Liberty.  Gameplay quality was heightened to a wonderful high as the player could now fire in first person mode.  Hold up guards and threaten them for items.  Hide fallen enemies in lockers.  Hide in the lockers themselves, hang from railings, etc.  Unfortunately, however, the storyline of Metal Gear Solid 2 did not live up to the first game whatsoever.  While the first hour of the game is filled with fun snake-play action, the story quickly turns it's focus ten years into the future from the opening sequence of events to a new rookie member of FOXHOUND, codename Raiden (A.K.A. ""Jack the Ripper"").  Raiden's story is filled with plot twists, deception, love, revenge, etc.  But unfortunately the player is introduced to this character halfhazzardly and very bluntly in my personal opinion.  The problem is is that those who have played Metal Gear Solid know their hero Solid Snake, they know his past, his troubles, his triumphs and his falls.  Raiden . . . we know nothing about him and yet we are expected to accept him as the warrior he is.  Now, granted, Kojima does a fine job of developing Jack, but his character is not yet the hardened warrior that Solid Snake is, and thus, even then, he's lacking.  Overall, the gameplay of Metal Gear Solid 2 is excellent, the storyline of Metal Gear Solid 2 is poor.Kojima, however, has left us hanging as to what is next for Snake,now that Raiden's story has come to an official end, what will happen to our old friend Snake who we've missed for about 4 hours of gameplay :(Well now, we're not sure, according to Metal Gear Solid 3 trailers, we're looking at the 1960s era where a ""Snake-looking"" individual is fighting off enemies in Viet Nam Style territory.  Gameplay wise, Metal Gear Solid 3 looks like another improvement.  The terrain allows for Snake to use camoflauge, hang and snipe from treetop, feed on snake, alligator, fish, and the like, create traps for enemies in the wilderness, etc. etc. etc.  But my main concern is the storyline.  Is Kojima taking a break from the current day storyline to tell the story of Big Boss? (snake's ""father""-explained in MGS).Is Kojima telling a past story (ridiculously young snake?)Time travel (pfft, I hope not)Or is it the more likely option:  Kojima is screwing around with our minds again and we won't know til the last minute whether or not the story is any good from the start (just like mgs2).Despite this, the gameplay looks like it will compensate for a poor story, but nonetheless I hope that there will be an amazing storyline to help explains the whole patriots conflict, which seems to be what Kojima was alluding to in the last minute of mgs2 (reference mgs2 storyline).Other Metal Gear Titles not sited nor explained:  Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, Metal Gear Solid: Ghost Babel, Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance, The Documentation of Metal Gear Solid 2, Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes.",5,Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater Prequal? or Sequal?,1078012800,"02 29, 2004"

6924,59132,A3KZ7OH4VRL048,B0009Z3IZ0,Jonathan,"[0, 0]","The Ghost Recon franchise, after the disappointment that was ""Ghost Recon 2,"" returns to what works (including a first-person perspective!) with ""Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter.""The plot is typical of a Tom Clancy game: that is, a [terrorist group/rogue warlord/enemy mole] is threatening [national security/a government official/to start World War III] and you are [an elite operative/special forces soldier] that has to stop him. Let's be honest - you don't buy these games for the plot, you buy them for the action, tactical action at that. GRAW delivers with good gameplay; good enough that the nonsensical plot (and rather swift, unfulfilling ending) is almost forgotten.The graphics are decent for the PS2, and the AI - both allied and enemy - is a good step above previous GR games. Allies will fire around corners, enemies crouch to fire a few rounds then dart somewhere else. This actually balances pretty well, because although the enemies are much tougher your allies now behave like the special forces they are (and not the inaccurate idiots that passed for them in GR2).The tactical aspect that was missing in GR2 is back here, while retaining its fairly easy use system. There are two ROE modes - recon and assault - as well as follow, guard and attack commands, all of which can be issued as ""Go!"" commands a la ""Rainbow Six."" Your teammate is smart enough to use discretion when it comes to grenades, planting explosives, sniping and the like.Yes, I said teammate, singular. With the exception of a few missions where you run solo, you command the two-man Alpha team. There is usually another team - Bravo - that is operating on the same battlefield with its own objectives, although you end up working together many times, although you don't directly control them. Various support methods - artillery, a sniper team and an Apache, among others - are available in some missions. They have limited functionality, usually to do a specific task to forward the mission, but can be devastating if used correctly.One thing I miss is the ability to pick your gear kit for each mission. In GRAW, you are given a set kit for each mission. Usually it works, but I find myself missing the sniper rifle more times than not. Speaking of which, the ""hold-your-breath"" feature to balance your shots is back, making sniper rifles useful again.The way that GRAW gets around the gear kit issue is you now carry two primary weapons into combat (a battle rifle and a sniper rifle/sniper grenade launcher/bazooka, usually) and two items (usually grenades/grenade launcher and a pistol/demo charge). Toward the end of the campaign, however, you're stuck with just a rifle, which makes no sense because if you order your ally to attack in those missions he can whip out grenades and a rocket launcher.Another thing that is missing is the ability to lie prone, although the environments you fight in, particularly the Mexico City missions that make up 75% of the game, are not conducive to lying down anyway, so you don't miss it as much as you would think.All in all, GRAW takes Ghost Recon back toward its roots, which is a good place to be. It just needed to go a hair further.",4,A step up from GR2,1252195200,"09 6, 2009"

How wrong i was!So much has changed from the previous games, that the only similarities are the characters from the Rainbow series, everything else is different.The POV has changed so that everything is through goggles, this is not a big deal like all the reviews make it out to be, the outline of the goggles do not get in the way of any of the view, but when you get shot bullet holes appear in the googles glass obscuring all the view. I do not know what kind of goggles these are, but if the person was shot 3-4 times in the eye making these holes they would probably be dead.The gun selection has been severly limited, and although the names are different from the other Rainbow games they are just different varients and that is why the names are different. It did seem that they took away all the popular guns, like the G3A3, M16,M60 and others, and added many smaller machine pistols. I can not speak for other people but i would rather be killing people with a huge assault rifle than with a gun the size of my hand. You can only use a sniper rifle when the game lets you and the are next to no guns with scopes or silencers(the ones that do have them would definitly not in real life). All the gun sight systems are left to the stock option of needle and hole sighting, which is not typical of any special forces when they have red dots, scopes and lasers. This does get annoying when lining up a target because most of the gun gets in the way when looking at an  enemy.The controls have been drastically switched around, which seems to be for no reason since no new button options were added making the relayout a pointless joke. The way they have changed the button configuration has made it awkward for old Rainbow player, the left trigger used to be for changing weapons, now it throws grenades(real nice when im surrounded by my teammates and i frag them on accident)It seems that the games controls have been made very similar to Halo and other FPS games, just so that those people can get into it quicker.The graphics are in my opinion the biggest let down, they arent as good as the others, which is a shame because the others were quite good. The guns do not look realistic and instead look almost cartoon like, the scopes on the very few guns that have them do not reflect light or interact with the environment in any way. Every enemy is one of about 3-4 designs, and the environment is nothing special.The AI of both the team mates and the enemies is disgusting, i dont understand how other reviewers can say that they are intelligent or that they set up traps because the most i have seen them do is miss constantly with their guns only a few feet away from me. The enemy are almost as stupid as your own team mates who in every gun fight hide and switch to the hold option, causing you to go off without knowing that they are at the beginning of the map and you are at the end.The game would be semi decent if it were not the sequel to the other excellent Rainbow games, and its expectation of being better or at least the same smashed. The game is far too easy, but i have found many glitches that have stopped me from progressing. On the fifth level a door jamned and the only way i managed to get through was by constantly running at it until i fell through it. Other things like terrorists managing to shoot me whilst they are in the reload sequence(impossible) and the heart beat moniter only sometimes working properly have all dampened the game.The reviews that have given it a low score are from people who have played the other Rainbows, like good games, or expect better from xbox. The reviews that give it a good score are from people that are into quick fast paced games, that sacrafice quality and realism for a game that can be beaten quickly and easily.I would recommend renting it because there are a few fun aspects to it, but not enough to actually wish you had bought it.",2,What went wrong?,1127779200,"09 27, 2005"

I've played on hundreds of games over a few years and this and only a few others do I think should be remembered as one of the best.  I only review games that I think are worth it and so a lot of them say how good a game is, but this one is certainly worth the five stars that it is given.Obviously unless you live in a cave you'll know that the game is based around you as a God.  It's far more though.  You not only govern your own population in any way you want, but also you get to rear a creature from a tiny little guy to a massive creature that if taught properly can help you no end to create a working system for your population.And no kidding, he really learns what you tell him, if you were near him and you perform a miracle like shower, then he'll point at it in amazement and learn eventually how to do it himself, and if you make sure he's on the side of good (white) he'll help your population by creating food using miracle powers you have taught him, and he even helps with carrying things like wood to the store.  You can tickle him to tell him he's done something right and he'll learn from that, or you could hit him to tell him off if he eats a person or something, and believe me, if you let him and he's hungry, he will.A large part of the game is looking after your creature.  The story line is that there is an evil God called Nemesis who wants to take over the world, and it's up to you to stop him.  He has allies that you'll meet and wipe out hopefully in a good or bad way.By making nobody believe in a God in this game will destroy him.  Because it's belief that makes a God, when someone believes in one, one is born, and so obviously if you take over his realm in a good or bad way, he will cease to exist because nobody believes in him anymore.  That's the whole point of the game, make everyone believe in you and not in him.The game does require patience.  It's so varied that it takes a very long time to learn and half the main game is a structure of training teaching integrated into the story line.Only half way through will if all make sense.The atmosphere is by far the best ever experienced on a computer game.  You being God and providing your influence stretches far enough can zoom right out so that the island is a small object surrounded by blue sea, and so far in that individual grass's can be seen.You can go anywhere on the whole island again providing enough people believe in you to create a big enough influence.  Once you have gain control of one island you'll go through a portal onto the next.Throughout the game there are scrolls.  Some silver and some gold.  The silver ones when clicked on are side missions that get you something to play with like a beach ball.  I never go to another island without it.  As soon as the portal opens, I chuck in my beach ball to play with when I'm bored.  Some Gods prefer to through rocks, trees, sheep, cows and people, I prefer the beach ball.So the single player game is an excellent experience that you can play in any way you want.  You look after your creature at the same time and you can even fight other creatures with him and he can get hurt and need some TLC, it's cool.The management side of the game really requires patience and good thinking.  It's pretty demanding to make your people totally happy, so don't worry if their not, just give them the essentials through miracles and make sure enough are breeding to continue the population and make sure the keep improving their belief so that you can go further from you town centre.There is also a Gods playground, which you can visit at anytime you want to muck around and throw things about.  And also as a side to the excellent main game you can play a skirmish game against one, two or three Gods simultaneously and try to win over the populations.Also, finally, the game has what I think the is best ever seen and largest quantity of game statistics ever.  It's got loads of graphs and numbers showing births deaths, population of male, and female people, and even the amount of food eaten and number of houses.So, to say that this game isn't good just because it's a tad hard on the brain isn't fair at all.  It's one of the finest and original games I've played on so far and deserves nothing but praise.",5,Underestimated excellence,1020988800,"05 10, 2002"

After the initial shock of the eye-melting visuals subsides, you are not left with much. The fighters are hollow and don't have nearly as much attacks as other fighting games. That said, the game's reversal system is extremely smooth and satisfying, though much too easy when it comes to timing the counters. The reversal system is based more on luck than actual skill, decreasing the game's longterm value. The sound is equally hollow and is made up of lifeless grunts and yells. Being the fighting game player that I am, I am very strict about how complex I want games to be and my  expectations are high. But for the casual fighting game players, add another star to my score and buy the game. The graphics alone are reason enough to purchase this game and show your friends why X-Box is the UNDESPUTED champion when compared to the other consoles!",3,"Not The Deepest Fighter, But It Sure Is Pretty!",1022889600,"06 1, 2002"

(Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...,"[0, 0]","King & Balloon, Bosconian, The Tower of Druaga, Dragon Buster, Grobda, Motos, and Rolling Thunder are neat little additions to Namco Museum's portable outings, but let's be completely honest here: You most likely got this collection because of the new four ""Arrangement"" games included. If you did buy this for your memories with the classics, including the ones I've mentioned above, then good for you! That's just more for you to enjoy. However, the Arrangement games are arguably the meat of the package, so let's focus on those for a little while.Each Arrangement game is, unfortunately, not the mid-90s updates to their respective arcade classics, but instead they are all-new games that attempt to serve the same purpose. If you have an iOS device, you can buy these games individually for $3 each (Except for New Rally-X Arrangement, oddly, as it's not on the App Store) although they're labeled as Remixes instead of Arrangements for some reason.Pac-Man Arrangement is a no-brainer - It takes the classic dot-munching, ghost-avoiding/chomping maze gameplay and expands upon it by giving the yellow blob multiple worlds and environments to travel through. The game is colorful and vibrant, and the mazes sometimes provide a small gimmick or two that would change how you would plan your way through. At the end of each world, you even ""battle"" a giant ghost boss that you must defeat by splitting it up into smaller ghosts and eating them. Perhaps the only major problem I have with this game is that the enemies hardly put up much of a fight. Even the regular ghosts you face as you go through levels move much slower than they did in the arcade hit, and the bosses are monotonous, as each boss follows the same format. It's just overall not a challenging game. It's otherwise a very fun game, but I just prefer the 1996 game of the same name (Which you can find in Pac-Man Collection for the Game Boy Advance, or Namco Museum for the Gamecube, PS2, and Xbox).Galaga Arrangement doesn't quite revamp things to Pac-Man's extent, but it's still a nice variant of the shooter. This may not be your papa's Galaga, but he can still jump right in. There are only a couple major differences between this and the original, and those differences are the numerous new wave formations of aliens, and the boss battles you face at the end of each world, which do in fact put up a fight unlike  in Pac-Man. I just wish the double-firepower ability returned - Instead, you get a slightly stronger variation of your default gunfire. Compared to the 1996 Galaga Arrangement, this isn't bad, but I miss the extra little things the 1996 game offers (Including but not limited to rotating environments).And now we head to the games that force me to dock off a star on this review.New Rally-X Arrangement feels incredibly half-baked. It does nothing to add to the original game's formula other than subtle things like mud sliding (Which hardly ever affects your movement), and ramps your car jumps off to reach an opposing area. But by the time you reach the levels you finally use those things, you're probably already worn out. While the game doesn't really do anything to improve the mechanics of the original, it does provide some frustrating AI as time goes on. Don't be surprised if there are levels where you crash almost right after picking up a flag.Just play the original New Rally-X, which is included here...Dig Dug Arrangement fails to satisfy thanks to a similar problem. The enemies may not be any tougher than they were before, but the obstacles such as boulders move in illogical manners, such as SIDEWAYS at times. On top of that, Dig Dug himself is painfully slow. The last thing you can expect from this game is a solid pace.Of course, this review can't be complete without providing an at least brief look over the arcade classics that are included in this robust compilation. Here we have games pulled from the Pac-Man series, Galaxian series, Rally-X series, and the list goes on. Like I mentioned way earlier, King & Balloon, Bosconian, The Tower of Druaga, Dragon Buster, Grobda, Motos, and Rolling Thunder are more obscure classics that are relatively new to the Namco Museum series, more-so the portable outings, and I'm glad Namco decided to include those. After all, it's a little tiring to obtain the same games as Namco Museum installments continue. I think I have enough versions of Pac-Man.In terms of being a video game collection, Namco Museum Battle Collection is a must-have for PSP owners. If you are looking forward to the four Arrangement games featured here, just don't expect much from the latter half. They aren't worthy to be in this otherwise really great handheld compilation.",4,The best portable Namco Museum!,1382745600,"10 26, 2013"

I bought it ASAP, not expecting a clone of TLJ by any means, just hoping for a good adventure game.Well, I have yet to finish Syberia and it's been 9 months. The game is breathtakingly beautiful to look at, and obviously designed with care.But as lovely as the game is to look at, the story is kind of plodding, the voice acting is (frankly) terrible, and the game just has no personality. The player is given little chance to explore environments or make choices -- you simply have to point and click your way through every (often very derivative) puzzle to get to the next point.One of the things I loved about &quot;Longest Journey,&quot; as well as &quot;Sanitarium,&quot; &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; &quot;Myst 3&quot; and the &quot;Monkey Island Series,&quot; was the sense that we got the chance to contribute to the story or character's choices and personality. Characters like April and Guybrush really sparkle simply because the game doesn't just want to get you from A to Z, but to help you explore a world and feel part of it. So there are those little extras, like clicking on an object or a character just to enjoy the protagonist's responses to it (&quot;I'm not picking that up!&quot;) and to learn about the character. There's nothing like this in Syberia.I wish I'd liked it more, and do hope to finish the game someday (I got about 2/3 through before finally giving up in boredom).

32,130798,A2KJXEXBBUDHXA,B002BSC54I,B. Gentry,"[0, 0]","Legend of Zelda games were defining moments for me growing up. Discovering the original NES game, spending months with ocarina songs in my head, and the pitch-perfect story of Twilight Princess. In fact, I still wrestle with the idea of getting a tri-force tattoo on a regular basis. The first couple hours of this game triggered all those memories and hands-down the thing that tugs at my heart strings the most: the sound design. Every little sound that's been carried through each incarnation makes me indescribably happy. That's why it's almost painful to admit that Skyward Sword was only an average game when compared to the rest.Two-thirds of the game can be described as a fetch quest. This painful aspect comes in the form of, ""Oh you've collected A, B and C? Now you can collect D, E and F!"" However the best example I can give- at a certain point you must gather a piece of song from a forest god. You talk to this person, they recognize that you were sent from the Goddess herself (thus, the Creator has vouched for Link's journey) but still they feel the need to test you and scatter twenty objects across the land. Those objects don't add up to a new weapon or heart piece, they're just a pointless exercise to waste your time. This can be summed up saying that I rarely felt like any of these missions directly related to my final goal.Most locations have rather clever design and throughout the game they keep it interesting by transforming the landscape. However, in the more detailed temples I'm never given context for the design or past importance of these areas. Previous Zelda games had unique tribes living in each area that would give you the history of the land. However Skyward Sword takes place in a land that's been vacant for a very long time. Literally and figuratively it robs the game of life, story and a level of subtext that, in previous games, gave reason and purpose to each new land. The only constant resident here is your new guide, Fi, who is annoying as ever, even more so than Navi. She will state the obvious, ""this door appears to be blocked by a gate,"" and chime at you each time you should change the batteries in your Wii-mote.My biggest gripe however is that I was expecting something new in the way that Twilight Princess accomplished. I had high hopes that as Zelda takes out on her own journey early on, that she might rise up and become a hero as well. They position Zelda and Link as two heroes on the same journey, just on different sides. As such I was excited to see Zelda channeling the powers of the Goddess so that they would literally be fighting side-by-side in the end. No such luck, even with all the powers of creation inside her, she's relegated to a damsel-in-distress that is either on the sidelines or needs to be rescued. It's been said before but when Zelda is constantly dismissed in this way, it begs the question of how it became known as the Legend of ""Zelda."" This game was an opportunity to finally make this her story and it completely dropped the ball.The good aspects of this game are everything you most likely already know. The sound design is some of the best in videogame history. The clawshot, bow, Master Sword and even a few new clever devices. A vital part of the story always worth telling is the underlying mythos of the tri-force and Link/Zelda. One of my favorite things about this franchise is that they essentially tell this story for each game but every time they add something new to the mix. This game does so, but only in a vague way by lightly hinting that the struggle is cyclical. Trying to tie the stories together isn't necessary, after this long we've come to accept that each Zelda game is an alternate version of the same story.The game is not all bad, in fact it's still better than the majority of the games out there. My level of comparison for this game is based on past Zelda games and what I expect out of this franchise. I'm not comparing it to other AAA titles and I'm far more in favor of an adventure game such as this as opposed to an ultra-violent space marine shooter. So if you're a huge Zelda fan it's still worth picking up (it clocks in at 40hrs) but you're also not missing out by skipping this one.",3,"Same Great Game, Nothing New",1336780800,"05 12, 2012"

6772,42864,A2IF5C0I5BH11F,B0000C0Z0O,Kala,"[11, 12]","Let me start this off by saying that I absolutely LOVE the Lord of the Rings.  I got this game for Christmas and I was dying to play it!  I started it up and it worked great!  It starts with some video clips from the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers movie, then throws you in to the Battle of Helms Deep as Gandalf for a ""tutorial.""  It's a little confusing, but also an interesting and unique way to learn the game.  I did manage to beat it with no problems.From there, I've had nothing but problems though.  To put it simply, the game is WAY too hard.  To make matters worse, there is no way to save in the middle of a level.  After you beat the Helm's Deep tutorial part, you have three options.  You can play the Path of the Dead (as Gimli, Legolas or Aragorn), play the Road to Isengard (as Gandalf) or an Osgiliath level that I have not tried.  I tried the Path of the Dead level about 20 times and managed to make it to one ""save point"" but kept dying after it.  I finally gave up for the day, only to come back later and find that the ""save point"" isn't really a save point.  If you decide to come back and try again a few hours later, you have to start right from the beginning.  I tried again and again, and could not beat the level - even on EASY.  Also, on Path of the Dead you pick who you want to play and the other two characters follow along.  All of the bad guys go straight for you, never for the other two.  So when I was playing Aragorn, all the bad guys came after me while Legolas and Gimli sat around and did nothing.  Every once in awhile Legolas shot off an arrow, but he never killed anyone or did much damage.  Why even be there?  I got so frustrated I was screaming and cursing at my PC.I decided to give Path of the Dead a rest and try the Road to Isenguard.  In that one you play as Gandalf.  I managed to make it past 2 save points and finally hit another roadblock.  There is a very difficult portion of the level I haven't managed to beat. I've died about 25 times on it so far.  It's just way too hard.  I switched it between ""normal"" level and ""easy"" level and there was ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE.  Easy level is insanely hard.  And without any option to save in the middle of a level, it's just plain frustrating.  Games are supposed to be FUN.. and while this one has its moments, it's been more of a frustration for me than a good time.I finally decided to look up some cheat codes on the internet to see if I could get some assistance because the game was basically kicking my butt.  I come to find out there's zillions of great cheat codes.. YAY!  But wait, there's a catch... you can only use cheat codes after you have beaten the ENTIRE GAME without using any!  ARGH.  Why even have cheat codes?  Do lots of people beat the game on their own, then want to play it on an easy level using cheat codes?  Most people I know, when they beat a game they then want to play it on a HARDER level.  I honestly don't know what the game designers and programmers were thinking.  Maybe it's because this game was designed for a console and was poorly converted to PC, I don't really know.Another big annoyance is the camera angles.  They switch on their own, you have absolutely no control.  This tends to be especially aggravating when you're running around a corner and the camera angle suddenly switches and you can't see what's ahead of you.The graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is interesting.  It's more than just running around killing guys.  My favorite part on the Road to Isenguard level is where you have to blow up the arrow towers (which is also the part I keep getting stuck at).  Some other reviewers complained about the cut scenes, but I loved them.  I adore all three movies which is the main reason I wanted to play this game.  I am just so disappointed that it is so hard and so frustrating, with no cheat codes or anything available to help ease the difficulty.  I was so impressed by the graphics and I so wanted have a blast playing this game.  If it wasn't so hard, or had the option to save more often, I would enjoy it so much more.  So for graphics, I give it 5 stars.  For enjoyability (is that even a word? &lt;g>) I give it 2.  Overall, 3.5 and I will round down to 3 because I too often end up wanting to punch my computer screen after playing this game for an hour.The makers of this game should have spent more time making it PC friendly.  Also, there should have been effort to make this game friendly to casual gamers who don't have the skill of the ""uber gamer"" who like games to be so hard.  There are different levels for a reason, easy level should be just that: EASY.",3,WAY too hard,1074384000,"01 18, 2004"
7321,53472,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B0007P8FN2,Terry Mesnard,"[67, 69]","From the people who brought us Knights of the Old Republic comes another genre-blending game with a fabulously twisting plot.  If you own an Xbox, you should own this game.  It is not only the best Action RPG on the Xbox but one of the best RPGs played in recent memory.For those who have played KOTOR, this game will be instantly familiar.  At the offset, you pick a character and are thrust into a world of moralities.  Unlike KOTOR, the morality system is a little more complex for the most part.  Instead of focusing on good and evil, your character has the choice of being endlessly helpful, understanding and tolerant of everyone (in other words believes in the power of the human spirit) or someone who reveres strength.  As an example of this strength concept, there is a decision early on about a dam that is open and has caused problems for a town because the sailors are land locked.  A wine merchant wants the dam to remain open so he can make a killing off of the sailors.  If you follow the Way of the Open Palm you would probably close the dam so that the town can prosper in what is should be doing.  If you follow the Way of the Closed Fist, on the other hand, would decide that if the town were strong they will survive this current hurdle and that it is only that, a hurdle.  It gets a little more tricky than that and does open some areas for roleplaying your character and deciding what you would really do in that situation.  Bioware is also wonderful at making you think about your decision as they give you new information just as soon as you make a decision that might change how you feel about the situation.My only complaint with the system is that while they say that the two paths are different from looking at things as good and evil, there are still some instances where there is a ""good"" and an ""evil"" way of doing things.  I might have rationalized why I would be doing something that way, yet I would get points from the side I didn't want because it was clearly delineated as ""good and evil choice.""  So, that's a bit frustrating given that their system isn't supposed to be good and evil.  But, overall the system works well and really makes you think.I didn't really care for KOTOR because of the battle system and that is probably the reason I'm enjoying Jade Empire much more.  The fighting system is simple yet deep.  As you progress you will learn different martial arts style that you can map to the D-pad for quick and easy access.  And you will be constantly changing your styles as the techniques to defeat enemies will constantly evolve.  Some monsters are immune to certain attacks so you will have to experiment and find the best ways of devastating your foes.On the simple side, the combat is really about rock, paper scissors.  You have a quick attack and a time-consuming attack (and a knock back attack that really only helps when you are surrounded and need some space).  When someone blocks you use your time consuming attack, otherwise you mostly use your quick attacks to offset their own long attacks.  It's pretty simple and easy to used to.  However, some battles can become a button masher either way you look at it.  But it's still exhilarating and fast with many ways of deciding how you want to play.  Do you want to focus on using weapons, martial arts, magic, transformations?  A little of the above?  It's all up to you.The game is beautiful most of the time.  The art style is impeccable and really helps create a full-flesh universe.  Since it's based on oriental myth, it doesn't take place in the Orient as we know it but a mythical world that incorporates themes from oriental culture.  Because of this, the desiginers are free to create whatever their imagination can make.  And it's beautiful.  There are some places that I stood for awhile and just looked because it was so surreally beautiful and soothing.  It made me wish that sometimes our world wasn't so industrialized and that we could go back to what was a more simple beauty.  It was that affecting.  However, sometimes, the backgrounds look painted on.  Some of the hills and areas that act as blockades for where you can't go aren't that well designed.  Also my character's body type makes me laugh because his pecs are super large and his abs are indented in his body that I laugh whenever I see it.The game moves impeccably fast as well.  Your character runs and I mean runs through the areas.  The framerate is great.  But, like KOTOR before it, the game stutters sometimes when you are running and turning the camera.  When the camera pans, the game flutters sometimes as it tries to take in everything that happens.  In battles, the game hardly ever stutters.  And the battles can end up having a good dozen or so enemies fighting you and your partner so they can get pretty hectic and the graphics engine does a great job keeping the motion moving.Aurally, the game is a treat.  You will find some cameo voice actors that are immediately familiar (look for John Cleese in a hysterical role).  The music is well done and has a wonderful oriental bent to it (of course).  Also, Bioware hired a real linguist to help create the fictional language used in the game.  It is very familiar to oriental language but isn't real.  It was created solely for this game.  And that's amazing.Unfortunately, my problem with the dialogue in the game is the same problem I had with KOTOR.  It's great and all but all too often the plot developments and dialogue becomes a ""talking head"" type situation where anyone who has something important to say gets a close up of their face while their lips move and the dialogue is heard.  This is unfortunate for me because I get impatient sometimes and will just read the subtitles and skip through most of their dialogue.  It's never ""dynamic"" in cutscenes like in some RPGs I've played (hands down the best use of dialogue in an RPG goes to FFX that used dialogue to move the plot but it wasn't a novel dialogue; it was more of a movie dialogue).  The dialogue in Jade Empire is sometimes like a novel.  So, for those who aren't interested in talking heads delivering dialogue this might get annoying after a time.  But the dialogue is genuinely well voiced and excellent.My only other complaint is the load times.  While not as annoying constant as Fable where each and every small zone no matter how small had to be loaded for a good 5-10+ seconds, it still is a pain when you have to go through zones for a quest.  For instance, in the beginning of the game you have to go through the town to the school (a load screen) to get a quest, go back to town (load screen) to talk to someone, then back to the school (load screen).  And it's unfortunate because the actual quest takes maybe a minute, but a good 20 seconds of the time is spent in load screens.  That's a uncharacteristic load time though as generally the areas are big and don't usually require many loads.  Although another incident where it is very noticeable is in an arena combat situation where before and after each arena battle it has to load for a good 5-10 seconds.  The kicker is, some of the arena battles are over in about a minute or much much less and yet you have to deal with two load screens comprising a good 10-20 seconds.  So, in some areas it can be annoying and definitely pulls you out of the game when you should be pulled further in.  And, it becomes especially annoying considering that games like Halo 2 are seamless after the original load.Overall, though, this game is gold.  It's perfectly plotted and paced and has Bioware's trademark in excellence stamped all over it.  It ranks as one of my favorite games this year so far along with God of War and Psychonauts.  I would definitely recommend buying this game.  There are some problems that I have noted but you know regardless of the problems, this is an excellent game with an excellent story.  And, at 22+ hours, this adventure is worth taking.**NOTE: You should definitely pick up this, the Limited Edition of it if you can still find it.  For the initial run they are all Limited Edition and after they are gone, you will only be able to get the standard game.

Part of it is that I always loved games where ""point A to point B"" was relatively simple. Not that I want easy games but I like games where I can just pick up and go and after a bit of brainteasing, I figure out where next to go whereas in this series you can explore continously and still find more than you thought was there. With the first Prime being my favorite, Fusion is another one of those games where it's expertly done and well-crafted but you end up treating it unfairly to other games, either in the series or in general.Story: More story-extensive than anything (that is, until Corruption), Samus was infected by a strange parasite known as X while on SR 388. Almost dead, scientists use a Metroid-based vaccine to cure her but while on the space station, the parasite breaks out and quickly infects the various areas. Not to mention a Samus-like enemy, the SA-X, is after her and with the help of a computer AI named Adam, Samus has to rid the station of X before it infects other planets and civilizations.Graphics: With the help of some cutscenes, the story in Fusion feels more grander than before and through rather simplistic screens (i.e an image of Samus with overlayed text) it's a more immersive story. As far as the ingame graphics are concerned, they're fairly commonly seen and everything is as it should be but it has a bit more detail and levels have a bit more going for them.Sound/Music: As always, the music has that otherworldly quality to them where it's quite haunting and eerily beautiful in its orchestration as the music is meant to help support the gameplay rather than be its own catchy tune a la Final Fantasy music. It might not be a downloadable soundtrack but it's a pleasure to have on anyway, that is if you like that ambient stuff.Gameplay: Same old, really. Samus starts with barely anything and through exploration, upgrades her suit and weapons which include staples such as the morph ball, charge beam and various suits. My one complaint is that there wasn't a lot brand new. Most of it I've seen before and aside from one upgrade I probably haven't seen yet in the 2D ones, everything feels too familiar. Also, many people might not like the hand holding the game does since every new area or objective completed has you go to a navigation room where Adam will tell you what to do next, even say with red arrows (literally) what room it's in. I didn't like this and preferred Prime where it told you the specific room but not exactly the route on how to best get there.The difficulty is fine aside from the bosses since like most of the series, the bosses can easily whomp you and quite a few almost made me throw the DS across the room since it felt too unfair at times. I don't mind a game that challenges me and keeps me on my toes but games where quick wits and careful playing still nets you game over screens just isn't my idea of fun but I guess it balances out the game: easy exploration, tough-as-nails bosses.It might not be my favorite entry of the series but any Metroid really tends to be worth a playthrough and Fusion is no different.",4,A solid entry into the franchise,1132358400,"11 19, 2005"

In essence each faction is battling for control of the planet, across continents, battling with the other 2 factions in a space-combat setting.We were playing this non-stop during the beta, so we were familiar with the game when we bought the full version. Still, the built in training is very helpful, and doesn't require you to be on line. The virtual practice areas let you keep practicing if you have more questions.There are a variety of terrains and environments to fight in, and the graphics are well done with lots of detail. You can customize your character's voice and look and of course be male or female. Your character can have a variety of skills, helping you fit into the needs of your faction. You can be a heavy-duty soldier, or the guy who flies the dropship, or many other roles.The game does a great job of encouraging team play. There are many ways in which team members can help each other out, gaining experience and cash as you go to get more skilled and wield more weapons and armor. With an ""Instant Action"" option, you can even teleport immediately to where a battle is taking place!As with much of the web, people with slow connections or hosting through slow ISPs are going to have issues. The graphics and volume of users playing mean that it pays to have a decent machine with a good video card. But that's no different than any other on line play.

The Playstation 2 was my favorite console and may very well still be. But the PS3 was doomed by it's own name. When your on top, there are those who say you can only go down from there, and I feel that right now this is what is going on with the ps3. I kept hearing talk of the graphics. People were talking about how amazing they would be. Often people hear this and just have in there heads that the graphics are outstanding. While the graphics do look good, you will not notice much unless you have a high deff tv. I know alot fo people have them but I choose not to spend over 1500 dollars on a tv. So unless your a person with a really great tv the graphics will not be as good as they could be. Sony cut alot of there market by doing this. You must think of every one in order to succeed. Then I hear people talking about the sound. Well once again sony took off alot of fan base with the sound. Unless you have a receiver and surround sound, you will not hear what is ment to be heard. Now to the games. From the reviews I am reading, both fans and media, there are only a few games out that are any good. I know this is how most systems are when they launch but if I am going to pay 599.99, I want gold. Every game I play sound be as amazing as the last. That is another thing. The price. I don't know how many people can just throw out 600 some dollars for a toy. I hear the 20 gig Playstation 3 was discontinued. If Sony is so secure about it's product then why would it do this. I hear that there are game companies with Playstation 3 games finished, but they will not release until the fan base grows. So even after companies spend all the time and money on the ps3 games they still will not let sony sell them. They would rather loose money. That is how low the sales of the ps3 are. The reason the price is so high is because Sony is failing in there $1000 blu-ray dvd players. So they put one in the ps3 to get people to buy dvds to use it with. Then I'm sure they think people will buy a blu-ray player. So what it comes down to is Sony is failing in psp,blu-ray,umd,and ps3 sales. I chose not to take a risk of wasting my money on something that I am not sure will stay in the industry. I'm not saying don't buy a ps3. If you want to, go for it.

In the case of Revelations, there are some added content which is great, others not so much. Die-hard AC fans have played three games arleady, and most likely exhausted all there is to be given. For Revelations, it still stays true to the classic AC feel. Classic enough that they brought back Altair from the first game of old, but the fact that he has a changed look and voice might disappoint players who have played the game series till this point. I can tell in some dialogue that the actor they put on tried to follow the same format as the original voice of Altair, and cudos to him. Nevertheless, the accent takes away the stoic nature. Now, I don't wish to put out that the game is horrible, I say the contrary.Story-wise, it is the same but with a new twist towards Constantinople. The story was well put together, with two different main objectives for the story line. The ending, and I speak from my own experience, does bring nostaligic players to some sad moments, but I digress to avoid spoiling it.Gameplay is pretty much the same as Brotherhood, but vamped up slightly to fit the new disc. You now get a hookblade, which vastly increases freerunning and climbing cabability. Also, challenges for different factions unlock different perks, such as weapons or faction abilities. In fights, it was a job well done. The higher ranking officers do sometimes make a fighter finally take the flight, either for difficulty reasons or it just takes too long and isn't worth it. Otherwise, there are many different types of guards that force the player to adjust in mid-battle. And, of course, along with the good old throwing knives and then the infamous crossbow, you get bombs. You get a good selection of bomb types to choose from, which is a good way to determine a sense of style. The only issue I had hear was with some aspects of gameplay, such as sending assassins to do missions across the country. It is the same thing, but with a little more need to always look at the map and see how annoying it is to keep an area occupied. But Ezio is now a mentor, so that is an excuse.In regards to combining the first game and the second and thirs game, the developers did a good job. I mainly liked the soundtrack from AC1 and was sort of disappointed that the darkness was sort of taken away onward. But this game does a good job combining both styles music-wise. But, that is just me liking music. The game strongly advertised the ability to play as both Ezio and Altair. What that did is sort of put high expectations on how much you get to play as Altair, when in reality it is less than half of what you can do with Ezio. However, this is still Ezio's game and Altair is looking over the shoulder, so if you want to get Revelations just for Altair round 2, find a different reason.Multiplayer is still fantastic, and the gameplay has been advance for all good reasons. I say that multiplayer was the best thing that developers had done to continue and add off from Brotherhood.In conclusios, this is a great game for fans (Assassin noobs may have some trouble following the story obviously). Though the main story is short compaired to its predecessors (Especially AC2), it still satisfied me. I don't give it a 5 star rating only for the little annoyances that got me, but the fun factor is all the way up.

The whole piece is a cinematic love story with various plot twists to make it interesting to find out what happens next. The graphics were beyond phenomenal for its time and has hold up pretty well over the ages due to its pre-rendered back grounds. The CG as most reviews have said, are a work of art. Music are up to the veteran composer's standards and the new Junction system is an interesting departure from the norm.To the bad:The only thing about this game IS the story. There is nothing to ""Role-Play"" in this game. None of the choices I make have any lasting decisions and I am just left pressing the okay button to literally tens of minutes (if not more) of dialogue and in-game cut-scenes (which are admittedly gorgeous) before the next few random battle/boss battle only to repeat it over and over again - I am not kidding about this either - let me interact and play! It's called a ""game"" not a ""book"". You also can't really explore the world until late in the game, every area is off-limits until the appropriate time it's introduced. You can't modify your equipment as readily as you were able to in previous games and there is little point to the weapons themselves as the entire battle system seems to revolve around the Junction/GF system (Unless of course, you're doing limit breaks). Magic too is not as effective as the GF system - which is another fault on its on:As beautiful as it is to see these gargantuans of magic come to life to slay my enemies, each summoning takes around 30secs, and there is no turning off this animation - the worse part is that the amount of damage they do does not correlate in any way to the amount of time it takes to summon them. This means that every random battle (and there are a LOT until you learn the appropriate skills) takes about some amount of time to finish just due to the summoning animation.I had some high hopes for this game as I really enjoyed the preceding games in this series - overall, it's not a BAD game as some would suggest, but it's nowhere as addicting or fun as it could've been.",3,The Negative Reviews have their points,1341532800,"07 6, 2012"

Thankfully, ""The Force Unleashed"" proved to be much more enjoyable than I'd initially thought.  My first impression was bad because of several factors:1.  I'm not a console gamer at all, and so am unfamiliar with how these games are usually designed and implemented.  The roving camera is the main aspect that took quite a bit of time to accept.  The delay in its timing to assume the default position behind the player was really frustrating at first, and I would constantly lose my bearings.  After realizing that I'd need to pause for a few seconds for it to self-correct, that problem was solved.1a. It was crucial for me to find out that when engaged with an end boss, you have to option to set the camera focused on your opponent, regardless of what direction you are facing.  Boss battles in my initial attempt were horribly frustrating until I gleaned this basic piece of info from the Training mode.2.  Most games that I've played and enjoyed repeatedly are the ones that introduce skills slowly, so that the player has time to practice them and commit them to memory.  ""The Force Unleashed"" gives you access to most of the Force powers in the first level of the game, and it is overwhelming.  The pop-up windows that occur throughout the first part of the level not only interrupt the flow of gameplay, but are also too numerous to read, comprehend and remember.  I would recommend that anyone playing this game for the first time to go through the Training mode several times, as there are LOTS of different combos that can be employed through deft handling of the Wiimote and Nunchuk.The one downside to figuring out the answers to my initial frustration was that all of a sudden the vast majority of the game became quite easy.  Even the boss battles become fairly repetitive affairs.  Online guides will suggest different tactics, but the vast majority of big baddies go down the same way.  Because the game becomes a bit of a breeze once you figure out effective combat tactics, the only reason to play through the game more than once is to see the alternate endings.  Yes, there are also lightsaber hilts and crystals and holocrons to find, but none of these items are beneficial to play.  However, the lightsaber hilts and crystals are fun as they allow you to augment the appearance of your character, and it's cool to be able to choose your lightsaber color and style.  The holocrons just give you access to production art for the game.  Meh.So, definitely a fun game as long you practice all the special moves before you really dive into the fray.  However, it's a fairly short (and sometimes repetitive) ride, so don't pay more than twenty bucks!Dave S.***initial negative review below***I cannot review this game on its storyline merits.  I hear they are terrific, but since I view the new Star Wars films as decidedly sub-par, I really don't care about the story or character aspects.What I care about is fully enjoying the opportunity to finally wield a lightsaber in a realistic fashion and kick some ass!  Isn't that what any fan of the Star Wars franchise really wants?Yes.Does this game accomplish that?Not really.I'd had the opportunity a few months ago to play around with this game at a friends house, and recall enjoying the experience overall.  When my folks surprised my wife and I with a Wii for Xmas, I had no small amount of anticipation at being able to plunge back into heated lightsaber battles!  Alas, time had gilded my memories because my second venture was VERY short.I didn't play the game that long, probably around 10 minutes, before I turned off the Wii, took the disc out and said to myself:  ""Wow, I just saved myself a lot of money and even more frustration!""  While it's definitely entertaining to swing the lightsaber around, I had a LOT of difficulty replicating the special moves that seemed so simple during the training sessions.There are two major problems:1.  The camera never stays behind your character as you move, making it EXTREMELY frustrating when you constantly lose your bearings and have to move around a little so that the camera will take its default position behind you.  The fact that the game does not have a setting to root the camera behind you (no matter what direction in which you're heading) is an inexcusable error at this point in video gaming history.  It's ""all too easy"" to find yourself running in the opposite direction you want because the camera keeps swirling around you, as if unsure of where it's supposed to be.2.  The complexity of the game play does not develop slowly as you progress.  You can learn all the special moves before you begin the first mission, but retaining all of them so quickly proves near impossible.  Given how many different ways there are to utilize the Wii remote and the Nunchuk, it seems to me that it make MUCH more sense to introduce the special moves gradually so that the player can get used to them and memorize them for the future.  IMHO, the best games will teach you how to play them while you play them, and don't expect you to know every single thing from the moment you start.  Why should I be able access Jedi-level training moves when I haven't even played the game as the main character?!  He hasn't even been introduced yet!!I'm so glad that I was able to borrow this game from a friend.  Now I don't have feel like I've been ripped off by yet another Star Wars product that just doesn't measure up in any way.Try Boom Blox Bash Party instead!

In Dragon Age 2 you play a young refugee who is fleeing from the event of the first game and then try to build a new life for him or her self in the streets of the city Kirkwall all the while trying to develop relationships with a colorful cast of allies and maneuver through various conflicts within the city.The first thing I should mention about Dragon Age 2 is that there is no grinding, this game was clearly designed with a wider audience in mind and as such it do not just cater to the RPG fan who might enjoy spending hours just grinding through hordes of monsters to level up one's characters, in Dragon Age 2 you go through quests, and while quite a few of the quests will lead to combat there are no time in the game where you have to fight and fight and fight to develop the character, you can enough EXP just by doing quests.One of the problems with Dragon Age 2 is that is had become so simplified, the combat system have lost most of the strategic elements from the first game, you no longer can choose between a wide range of backgrounds and different races when you create your character, you have to play a human and your only choice is whatever or not you are a mage, a warrior or a rouge, and what sex your character is. Equipment is also simplified, this choice might make the game more approachable to novice RPG players and gamers who prefer other genre, but it might disappoint long time RPG fans, leveling, equipment, fighting, none of these is really important in Dragon Age 2, what is important is following the storyline, something that would be good, but...In Dragon Age Origins you have a complicated and epic storyline, there are allot of side quests yes but there is a overarching storyline, in Dragon Age 2 the whole game feels like it is patched together by side quests, yes some of these side quests from together into bigger story lines, however I have some difficulty telling you what exactly this game is about, mostly you run around, do quests and build your standing in the city, in a way this game feels a bit like D&D; meets The Sims. That being said the various quests are often interesting, the setting is excellent and the various characters you meet are well made and the game make good use of it's brilliant cast of voice actors.Sound in this game is very good, the music is appropriate, sound effects work and the voice acting is amazing, it is quite funny just to listen to the various characters chatter amongst themselves. Graphics wise the game is quite good but it do slip up at places, however technically the game is solid.Me and my hubby is now on our second play through of Dragon Age 2, the game is big and have multiple ways to go through the game giving it excellent replay value, I do wish that there where more of a prominent storyline in the game, however all in all I do not have many complaints, Dragon Age 2 is a good and fun game with characters you will get to care about, it is also a good starting game for fans of other computer game genre as it do not contain endless grinding to level one's characters. Also while having played the former game is a benefit as Dragon Age 2 reference it often, this game is a stand alone game and you can easily enjoy it without having playing Dragon Age Origins.*Spoiler Warning* One thing I feel I have to mention for Norwegian audiences is that Dragon Age 2 have one plot twist towards the end which might upset those affected by the recent terrorist attacks in Oslo and on Utya. Towards the end of Dragon Age 2 one of your allies, a mage name Anders places a magical bomb in a key building in Kirkwall and blow it sky high for political reasons. Now a blond, political radical named Anders (The same name as the Utya terrorist)blowing up buildings in the middle of the city might be a to painful remainder for those affected by the Utya terrorist attacks. Now I am not saying this game is inspired by the attacks, it was finished long before they took place, however coincidence have created elements in this game that is eerily similar in some ways to what happened and for some Norwegians this might be just to soon.*End of Spoiler.*",3,Solid RPG Title,1315958400,"09 14, 2011"

In my frank opinion, this filler title would have bankrupted a smaller game developer. The guns are horribly nerfed (no suprise there). The first person animations are either jerky, or seem to be absent. Enemy AI is not bad, except that, yet again, fear is not a factor. There are multiple levels where ou have a flame thrower, and maybe I'm just odd, but if someone is charging at me with a flame thrower, my priorities will change. Speaking of enemies about 90% of them are OBVIOUSLY infinitly spawned. The levels are fraught with 10' hallways with unopenable doors that 100+ armed men pour out of.My play style is DSM (dedicated squad marksmen), that means I snipe at 100-300M, and move up when clear. Unfortunatly, the enemies only stop spawning when your in the aforementioned hallway. Add to this that the 30-06 M1 Garand (2800-3000 ft lbs impact) takes atleast 3 rounds to kill, assuming you can hit anything. To be fair, when I sight in a weapon, I like the target to be on top of the iron sights, they put the target behind the front blade. Because of this I shoot alot of window sills.To call your allies roadblocks would imply the stop the enemy too. They dont. They stop you from being able to move. I have on more than one occasion had to jump to a checkpoint because an ally decided to take cover next to me, thus trapping me in a corner. It seems the only function they serve is to occupy any available cover, thus throwing you under the bus, and to yell supid expressins. Further more, the only true objective to this game seems to be not getting pidgeon-holed. The grunts from Halo threw less grenades, and somehow a solder who is on enough drugs to shrug off a BAR ban land a grenade in a pie dish from 60 yards away. 10+ times per level, I will be prone behind a box/bench, bush, etc and a grenae will land so close I can throw it back without moving. Also, this same enemy AI can make a headsho, while running, through smoke and bushes from 50 Yds, but your allies can't hit a guy taking a casual stroll six feet from them.The only moments in the game I truly enjoy are watching the AI Bonsai chargers beat the crap out of the immortal squad AIs. This can go on for up to a minut, and is very satisfying to see SGT. Roebuck in such pain. As for historical accuracy, the historical footage in the loading sequences seems to be purely or shock value, offering no insight into the mission, or meaningful information about the sitiuation. In addition all of the missions seem to be in fast forward, as 500+ Japanese/German troops are occupying a 4 acre island compound/city block.On to the good. The third person animations are good, and the enimies will occasionally, although obviosly scripted in advance, move things to make cover. The weapon variety is not bad, all the classics are there, with some new additions. Being a late war game, the shelled out theme is obvious, and expected. As usual for the WWII COD series, you get to drive a tank, and shoot out of an airplane. It wasn't fun the first time, it isn't fun now. That being said, the game is complete, and dosen't have any major bugs (clipping, missed animations, sound gaps, etc), just really stupid allies. The marines in Halo were more useful, atleast the got out of the way, and carried ammo for you.All together, this is not worth a buy, unless you have never played a shooter before, and have no expectations.I am presently in my final semester for my game design degree, and this is my 20 somethingth shooter including COD 1 and 2, ETQW, all 3 MWs, the Mass Effect trilogy (RPG yes, but lots of shooting), 2 Halos, MOH pacific assault (slightly better then WAW actually), and a small assortment of online shooters (Combat arms, etc). The nicest thing I can say about World at War is that it's like Chrome Hounds. Could have been a great game had Mech Warrior never came out.",2,"Terrible, just terrible.",1376956800,"08 20, 2013"

Yeah by the 25th balloon I had to save, it did feel monotonous but everything else was well-done. Including some of the villains that were sorely missed, Spider-Man 3 is basically the same thing with new features. With the Wii controls, it offers a different type of gameplay but polish is really lacking here as it feels unresponsive, lazy and even sluggish. Kids won't mind but this is definately not one of the better Spidey outings.Story: It incorporates the storyline of Spider-Man having the Alien Symbiote attached to him (honestly I couldn't figure out where he even got it in the game). Doc Connors has mutated and rampaging through New York while rival photographer Eddie Brock gets the Symbiote and turns into Venom.Graphics: The textures just look...ugly. Buildings up close are fine if a bit repetitive and lack of more refined details while it seems like the higher up you go, the more fuzzy they get. And of course enemies pretty much have 4-5 different settings and you beat up each one over and over. At least now we can go into the sewers.Sound/Music: Voice acting remains largely intact with Tobey Maguire and co. providing their character voices. It's difficult to badmouth Maguire since he basically says the same things over and over (production thing). The best though is Bruce Campbell providing our Narrator voice. He gets some hilarious things going (my favorite is the Spider-Man who doesn't act Spider-y on walls. ""You're just 'Man'? You're playing, 'Man 3?'"" The music is fine but I barely notice.Gameplay: For swinging you use the nunchuk and Wii-mote. Press Z or B and swinging the controller will send you flying. It takes some getting used to but eventually you get hang of it, although I notice it was more comfortable to just use the Wii-mote. Fighting is different as well with shaking the Wii-mote making your combos, A button for kicks/uppercuts. It works fine but the controls are a bit dodgy since it's hard to gauge just how fast to swing and pressing the A is rather slow, causing you to press it 5-6 times before he even does his kick (by which time, enemies are already beating you up). The ideas behind the controls are fine it's just they don't have the responsiveness needed.As for the game itself, it's very much like 2: very mission-based but thankfully the side missions are kept to a minimum a bit. Some seem slightly inconsistent though. One boss fight took so long because his health went down like a paper sliver with every punch. The one thing that is a pain is that there's these moments that seem like warped reaction commands from Resident Evil 4 or Kingdom Hearts II: at certain points a graphic will display, telling you swing your nunchuk sideways or your nunchuk or both. But they go so far and your reflexes can only go so far so it's a bit of a trial-and-error at figuring out how fast to go.Do yourself a favor and rent Spider-Man 2. While we do get enemies like the Lizard and Venom, 2 is just way funner.",3,"Like a lot of tie-ins, it feels rushed",1178496000,"05 7, 2007"

10254,68647,A8RGWWCC1PVMQ,B000FQ2D5E,NeoTristan,"[6, 6]","Funny how the original 'Stealth Espionage Action' game was born. Failed to create all-out action game due to the limited technology, video game auteur Hideo Kojima instead created a game where you avoid firefight and sneak around the enemy. Since the original inception of Metal Gear in 1987, the series have always represented the best of the best the gaming industry can offer.Although loosely linked, each iteration was stand-alone game that requires no knowledge of the previous games. It all changed in MGS4. If the past installments slowly build the background of one of the finest video game storyline, MGS4 not only creates an immensely excellent stand-alone plot, but also brings suddenly all previous story to the stratospherically mythological level. One must experience all past games to fully understand and appreciate the level of genius MGS4 provides. MGS4 interweaves all the story so clearly into one satisfying epic culmination and brings its story to a closure. In doing so, Kojima eradicated all the past shortcoming and confusion in the plotline of 'MGS2: Sons of Liberty', and making Raiden the coolest video game character you wish you could play as. (Never thought that was possible, did you?) The ultimate joke on us compliment of Sir Hideo Kojima and his far-out sense of humor for ridiculing him on MGS2 for so long.Close Quarter Combat (CQC) was improved upon MGS3, and not only you have free-camera, the 3rd person perspective is now over the shoulder instead of over the head, you have the 1st person-like accuracy. Furthermore, you now can shoot and move around in the 1st person perspective. All the movement and combat mechanics have been vastly improved and refined here compared to MGS3.MGS4 is a stealth action game first and foremost, but now you have freedom to choose how you go about your tactics. You can sneak around without killing, or you can sneak around killing everyone. But most of all, you can just go around killing everything that moves. With tons of high tech weaponry at your disposal, you no longer have to rely solely alone on stealth.  Improved upon camoflouge suit from MGS3, you now have octocamo suit. It adapts automatically to any environment you touch.  You also have 'snake eye' that replaced binocular and also works as infrared goggle.  You also have a useful aid from miniature metal gear called 'MK II' to survey the surrounding and even knock your enemy unconscious.  All these do not mean the dynamic of the gameplay changes into all-out action like gears of war.  You have to constantly monitor your psyche level.  Continuosly shooting your way around will decrease your psyche level that directly affects your efficiency in combat so stealth is still your best course of action.Metal Gear Solid (MGS) series always pushes the envelope to the very end of bleeding technology of its time. But here deploys Hideo Kojima a truly amazing in-game cutscenes generated by in-game engine to the CGI level seen from Final 'Fantasy VII: Advent Children'. All the staple camera techniques frequently seen in top Hollywood production is deployed here. They even use hand-held camera technique. We are talking about cutscenes directly generated by in-game engine itself, not pre-made cutscenes like CGI (computer-generated imagery). Truly beyond amazing achievement if you ask me. Natunally, the gameplay itself also looks outstanding. Possibly the best looking video game to date.All the good looking graphics and techniques will mean nothing without excellent voice-actings headed by David Hayter as Old Snake. The music composed by Harry Gregson Williams is another area MGS4 matches on par with the top Hollywood production. Voice-actings and music enhance the overall cinematic experience to another level.Level design is nothing short of excellent. His near perfectionist attention to details is shown in every single rubble in each level. Maps are very large, although devided by small section and loading screen. One fact that always bothers me no matter which game it is.  Loaging screen here is not as bothersome as ones in RPGs but bothersome nonetheless.There are so many hidden jokes, references to the previous games, and his usual far-out, often wierd sense of humors you need to find to fully appreciate how deep the game as whole truly is.Is this game perfect? No game ever is. But in this case, I am more disappointed for what it doesn't have.*****SPOILER WARNING*****First of all, the game is still too short for game of this magnitude. Gameplay itself last about 14-15 hours if you attack everything in linear fashion. Cutscenes are about 7-8 hours; total about 20 hours give or take a little.  'MGS3: Snake Eater' still stands as the longest game in the franchise.Next, Shadow Moses was a somewhat letdown gameplay-wise.  First time I enter Shadow Moses, and I hear 'Best is yet to come' from MGS1 in the background, it was a spine-tingling experience.  Then I run into Gekkos and suicide Gekkos.  In the plot sense, that was inarguably the best course, but I wanted to play more stealth action against soldiers and alarms and turrets as in MGS1. I can only hope in the inevitable 'Special Improved Edition' in the future, they give us a standalone mission set in Shadow Moses guarded by the FROGS, turrets, and alarms with boss fights at the end of each stage as bonus so they don't have to disturb the existing plotline.Next, we need cinema mode just like in MGS3: Subsistence so we can watch all the cutscenes and concentrate in story alone. Right now we can watch all the briefings cutscenes but we need to play the game again to watch the rest.Next, VR (Virtual Reality) Mission is something you could use to finetune your techniques just like in MGS1 and MGS2. Virtual Chamber in MGS4 just doesn't cut it. Give us VR Mission in the Special Edition.Finally, I would never thought I would say this. I want to play as Raiden. Give us Raiden, Kojima-San. Maybe Raiden's mission like Snake's Mission in MGS2. Better yet, how about the alternative path like 'Ada Wong' in Resident Evil 4 Director's cut so you can blend him in the existing plotline such as Battle with Vamp, etc. I humbly ask for your forgiveness for our ignorance of the past. Pretty Please with lots of sugar on top, Give us Raiden.Get the limited edition if you can by all means. It comes in excellent and cool-looking hardbound case. It contains the same original game disc in original Blu-ray case with artwork. But it also contains the second case that harbors two discs. One is Blu-ray disc contains about 150 minutes worth of documentaries from the history of MGS to the Making of MGS4. The other is soundtrack of MGS4. Must-have collector's item for the long time series fans.At last, Solid Snake's story comes to an immensely satisfying grand conclusion. This is one game that is meant to be thoroughly experienced; you invest your time in characters and storyline so much, you feel attached to the avatar in your actual gameplay. MGS4 is as close to Hideo Kojima's envisioned Magnus Opus since the inception of Metal Gear in 1987. At the end of the game (Be sure to wait and watch until the very end title shows), you will know you just experience the most cinematic video game ever created. The emotional resonance will ringer long after the end credit rolls. MGS4 is man's game like 'Dirty Dozen', not a cheek flick like 'An Affair to remember'. Just like all the previous MGS games, your heart will be filled up with such emotion that makes even grown men cry. Go ahead! Stand attention. Give this soldier a proper respect and one last salute. He really deserves it with all your heart.",5,The Grand Finale of the Solid Snake Saga,1214265600,"06 24, 2008"

It has a decent selection of games but most of them lean toward younger children, that is the way Nintedo has always been and will always be, but that's great for the kids. They often have 3rd party's censor their games to not include themes that may be to mature for the younger audience. This is a great move to protect children, but if you're older, it does get annoying. If you're a bit older, and looking for some mature games that aren't geared torward the pre-10-12 year old crowd, the system has a few but very little in that category, maybe a handful or more. GC lacks heavy 3rd party support and the little it does have, make a few mature titles but are usually quick cash ins with little substance, such as Capcom's recent announcements. But there are a couple good ones to be found, just very miniscule compared to the other consoles on the market.The system itself is very small, and that's great for fitting it in tight spaces. Very durable as well. The system doesn't play DVD movies or music CD's though, just a special mini disc that play the games for the system. And because the disc are smaller, it has less storage space, so some GC games often include less content that the versions of the same game on other consoles. If you want a great game console that plays games, DVD's and CD's, then this isn't what you're looking for, you'd be better with a PS 2 in that case.The gamepad is great though. Very comfortable but the button layout is a bit akward for certain games, but overall it's good. It also has 4 gamepad ports so 4 player games are definitely fun. But it does not include a modem, harddrive and the memory cards have very little save space that get filled up quickley with certain games, so expect to buy many memory cards down the road.The graphics and sound are also impressive, and most games have very fast load times. The system does not have an optical(toslink) output like the PS 2 does, but it is capable of prologicII whch sounds great, although not quite as nice as DTS/5.1.Overall, a nice system, but limited in terms of features such as DVD, CD, and 5.1 playback and also very limited in variety of games, and mostly geared toward children. It also does not have an online structure, so you will not be playing games online for quite awhile if at all.

8751,222697,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B00CSLIYXY,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[18, 21]","Platformers have never quite been the same since the end of the PS2 era. It's a genre that has mainly fallen into the hands of various indie developers, who seem to try and reinvent the wheel several times with each passing year. Sure, we'll get our Marios and Donkey Kongs, but for the most part, platformers have become an increasingly less marketable genre. Heck, even the latest Banjo game had the formerly lovable mascot driving Lego-esque vehicles. As a whole, the market has become incredibly cynical, and not open to games that, well, feel like games, and most of the AAA platformers we do get are stale or outright bad, with the exception of most Nintendo products.Which brings me to Namco, who has had a very similar struggle to reinvent Pac-Man, its flagship character for over 30 years. You name the genre, there's been a game with his bright, rounded face on the cover. Yet, with the exception of a string of great 3D platformers about a decade ago, and some wonderfully trippy Championship Edition entries, the old dog has relied mainly on ports and retreads to survive, while his wife has been a permanent fixture in bowling alleys, laundromats, and bars the world over (along with Galaga, of course.)So it's fitting then, that these two struggles collide headfirst in ""Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures"", an attempt to reboot the character inside of a 3D platformer. The result is a refreshingly uncynical romp that hearkens back to the early 2000's, when a game didn't have to do anything more than be a game. Surprisingly, in today's cutthroat world of people criticizing games for not having enough ""emotion"", this carefree formula delivers in spades.There's not much here in the way of narrative, but for formality's sake, here's the basic set-up. Pac-Man is a student in a futuristic city, which is suddenly set upon by ghosts led by the evil Betrayus. After surviving the initial onslaught of them, however, he discovers that his two best friends have been kidnapped, and that the villain has also taken a volatile device known as the Fridgidigitator. That's pretty much it, but honestly, you're not left wanting for much more than that. The dialogue is cute and even charmingly clever at times, like some of the better Saturday morning cartoons out there. But then again, nobody's necessarily playing a Pac-Man game for the plot.So that leaves us with what really drives a game in this series, and that is the gameplay itself. And even though I can't believe the words being typed right now, it must be stated that this game is absolutely wonderful on that front. This is one of the rare modern, 3D platformers that succeeds on almost every conceivable level at being a fun, engaging, and progressively challenging little adventure. The controls are smooth throughout, ensuring that every life lost feels like the fault of the player, and not of faulty development. Movement is incredibly fluid, with Pac-Man himself having jumps that have a satisfying weight yet forgiving float to them, and a brisk running pace that finds that nice balance between a sprint and a jog. Whether they're outrunning a dragon's deadly fire blasts in a cavern, or jumping between disappearing platforms above a city, players can count on the tight controls to carry them through their adventures. Impressively, that carries over to the combat, which can be a messy affair in most platformers. Here, though, it's kept pretty simple, and plays out like a pared-down version of the ""Batman"" Arkham series' system of melee combat; Pac-Man's basic attack is a chomp, which can be chained between each enemy and lead to combos that allow him to activate a special ""scare"" move. Everything here is simple, but it works exactly how it should, which is more than can be said for a lot of games these days, regardless of the genre.Namco-Bandai went the extra mile, though, and added in an element that could have either made the game or broken it, and it's pleasing to say that the former occurred. The power-ups in ""Ghostly Adventures"" are a sheer delight, and elevate the game to a level that's head and shoulders above the competition. None of them feel gimmicky or tacky in the slightest, each of them contributing something to the wide variety of worlds. Obstructed by a lava geyser? Freeze it as Ice-Pac, then use it to hop to the next area. Want to bounce between a maze of vertical walls? Turn into Rubber-Pac and bounce away. The other power-ups are just as fun, and allow to do everything from shoot elemental blasts, magnetize yourself to metal surfaces, or turn into the Pac-Man equivalent of a Katamari ball, except with more destruction and less collecting stuff. These are all very charming little abilities, and add an extra layer of depth to the game overall, making it one with more variety than others out there.Altogether, the game really plays like a dream. Levels are not too long or too short, for the most part, and considering you'll occasionally need to replay one or two to progress, which is one of my only gripes, that's a godsend. The boss fights are all very creative and fun to battle, and never feel like something to dread. And to top it all off, there are things to break up the platforming, like lava-surfing and sliding down icy passages. To be quite honest, this game comes at a funny time, because almost every single complaint I had about the recent ""Sonic Lost World"" is completely inverted in ""Ghostly Adventures."" Things I hated in that game are things I love about this one, due to the fact that they are done right here, and it never feels like the game is trying to be something it's not, which is an unlikely occurrence into today's marketplace.Now, it seems that the developer did not necessarily have a huge vote of confidence in this game, which is probably why the graphics are a bit on the lower budgeted side. It's certainly not an ugly game, but some textures are kind of jagged and flat, and don't really pop out like other games today. Some levels certainly look better than others, though, and so it's kind of a mixed bag in the end. What's not mixed, though, is the creativity present in each level, which makes up for the lack of graphical prowess. Environments are widely varied, even within worlds that have specific designations like fire or ice. Even the more dark, murky levels are alive with colors and clever visuals which lend a fun, snappy vibe to the entire experience. So while these are certainly not the best graphics you're going to see in a game this year, they may very well be some of the more colorful, which definitely works for what kind of the developers were trying to make.The music and voice acting in this game might be pretty divisive for some. True, the tracks are somewhat endearing, and certainly fit the mood of each level. However, they're not necessarily the most memorable pieces, and it's a real pity that most of the incredibly fun boss and mini-boss encounters don't have tracks of their own. As far as the voice acting goes, I personally find it to be rather adorable and endearing, with each character having a defined attitude and snap. Pac-Man himself is a fun little guy, constantly making puns which are so terrible that you may wince, but are ultimately going to make you laugh out loud. Some may be put off by it sounding exactly like a kids' cartoon, right down to how simplistic the story-telling and cutscenes are, but it didn't damage my experience at all. In fact, it lent a little something to the overall tone that struck a chord.That tone is one found in many platformers of yesteryear, from ""Crash Bandicoot"" to ""Tak and the Power of Juju"" to, more obviously, ""Pac-Man World 2."" This game shows a remarkable amount of restraint, like those games, and never tries to be something it's not. There are no gimmicks or marketing ploys here, only gameplay and funny, pithy little story that simply serves the purpose of pulling you from one level to the next. Furthermore, there are no attempts here to reinvent platformers, or some pretentious drivel like that. Instead of buying a new car, Namco-Bandai refurbished the parts and gave it a new paint job. That is to say, they took an established, classic formula, and managed to do in a way that feels truly sincere.Sure, there are some trivial little bits, like arcade games in which Pac-Man pilots little vehicles, or a miniscule hub world that allows players to interact with the denizens of the game. Putting those insignificant things aside, however, players are given a solid core game that is fun and fresh enough to stand on its own, to the point where I found myself playing bonus levels simply for the sake of experiencing more of what it had to offer.""Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures"" is precisely what the doctor ordered for the troubled 3D platformer genre, having solid gameplay enhanced by fun power-ups, varied levels, and an environment of innocent fun that feels alien in today's cutthroat world of competing military shooters, sandbox games and the like. Sometimes, it doesn't hurt for a game to try nothing more than being a game, and that is precisely what Namco Bandai has done here.Grade: 7.75",4,A-Maze-Ing,1383609600,"11 5, 2013"

Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. This game could have been great, but the technical issues and poor control scheme and UI made it nearly unplayable, at which point I completely lost interest in the game. I still finished it because I wanted to see what happens, but it felt more like a chore than a game. Overall I give this a 2/5. Read on for details.Graphics--------Samus, the ship, the monsters, the cutscenes and the environments are all beautiful to behold, but the poor lighting and confusing color scheme made it nearly impossible to navigate some areas. Paths around corners were way too easy to miss because the walls all blended into each other. Due to the lack of shading in the graphics engine, I spent way too much time muttering, ""There's supposed to be a path here somewhere"" than actually going from room to room. Nevertheless, despite this shortcoming, the graphics themselves are excellent. I give it a 4/5 for graphics.Music / Sound-------------The music was very well done. It was subtle, and you won't recognize many of the themes, but they added real atmosphere. Like a great movie soundtrack, you don't really notice it while you're there, and only really appreciate it in retrospect. The sound effects were all appropriate, with lovely explosions and beam noises and stereo effects. I find no faults with music nor sound. 5/5.Controls--------This is where the game really starts to fall apart. With the lack of a calibration system, you can't just point your Wiimote at the screen and expect it to aim where you want; you have to be able to see the cursor. Unfortunately, with all that's going on, you can rarely see it, so half the time you have no idea where you're aiming. The Z-targeting, if anything, makes it MORE difficult to aim. When you go to/from the ball, it often shifts your perspective around. This is extremely inconvenient when navigating in tight situations where there's no room for the camera. I never got used to the three different 'helmets' in the game, and I was always going into the wrong helmet for various tasks. I give it points for the space boost and the screw attack control scheme - that part worked pretty well. Overall, though, the controls were frustrating at best. 2/5.Gameplay--------Metroid should be fun. This was not fun. Going from place to place took FOREVER because doors wouldn't open when you want them to (due to a long-standing bug - they have to load the adjacent zone before the door will open). Looking up things in the menu system was incredibly frustrating, and the fetch quest at the end was contrived and pointless. The plot was uninteresting and convoluted, and about half-way through the game I no longer cared why I was performing these tasks - not that I could follow it anyway. The 3D map system is horrible. It's nearly impossible to read and using it is often more confusing than just looking around the room you're in. Between the poor load times, the frustrating control scheme, the monsters that just kept coming back over and over again (didn't I just kill you? what the...), the INCREDIBLY LENGTHY boss battles, and any number of things that robbed the game of any fun-factor it had at the beginning, I can't give this game more than a 1/5 for the gameplay.Replayability-------------Even if this game were replayable, I wouldn't want to. When you finish the game, it does allow you to go back and play it in ""hyper difficulty"" mode, but why would you want to do that? 33 hours of frustration later, and you want to leap back into it? I think not. 1/5.",2,Huge disappointment - shoddy controls and frustrating gameplay,1228953600,"12 11, 2008"

WHAT???!!! how awkward is that setup?  only preset #2 is worth using.4. graphics. i had everything maxed using evga 8800gts so obviously it doesn't require much. the graphics just aren't as crisp as split second (which i enjoy playing over this).in short, do not mix mario kart and need for speed into 1 game.",1,simply terrible,1275091200,"05 29, 2010"

And for a few months I did like the PS3 games; I think i played that Ratchet and Clank and Uncharted.  But at the time I wasn't really all that enthralled.Then after my 3rd Xbox 360 defecated the bed then I wound up busting out the ol PS3 for the actual games.  I used it every day for the blu rays but nary for the game playing feature itself.  I quickly became enthralled with a slew of the PS3 exclusives.  Infamous 1 & 2, Ratchet and Clank Crack in Time, Gods of War 3, Journey, Killzone 2 & 3 (especially 3) and the list goes on and on.See, for the first time ever when my previous ten console dies I plan on buying another one.

9703,44169,A2WPX0EE2DZGYK,B0000ZUA7I,"Axle F. ""The Brutally Honest Critical Reviewer""","[12, 13]","And this game sure delivers on that! The character animation is horrible and the story/plot line of the game takes only a few hours to complete. Don't get this game if you are looking for structured linear gameplay... Also don't get this game if you dont have a good programmable joystick and throttle control. Also don't play this game if you are looking for an awesome battle soundtrack (use you own music for that... rob zombie music makes the battles awesome!). I love the game because it has an option called scripting thats activiated through a sort of cheat code making a console window appear on command ingame allowing endless modifications and add ons. Since the laser battles in this game stock are pathetic and slow there are scripts you can get from fan sites to speed up or slow down or even animate and automatically take care of the boring stuff so you can go out and blow stuff up and take over the entire universe... there are even scripts that get rid of all spaceship sounds sines some people want realisim in space battles while keeping that menacing rumble of a starship in the cockpit view... But YOU NEED A FULL JOYSTICK. I actually broke my joystick from playing this game so much and pulling hard manuvers.Since most reviews here are a little blan Im going to describe what its like after it's modded and scripted correctly. Tweaked to my tastes, if you will.Imagine cruising in with your carrier class starship... bigger than anything else in the game. You ship is upgraded and modded to the max... this is something that could scare the gods themselves as it unleashes its full load of 150 heavy, medium, and scout class fighters to all swarm in on the usually overpowering enemy. The battle lasts for hours and you have to do everything in your power not to let your beautiful and heavily armed Carrier or battleship from getting destroyed by the enemys larger ships.You have your own personal and heavily armed corvette class ship waiting in your carriers docking bay for a quick escape just incase the unlikely event of having your carrier or battleship destroyed happens or if your carrier or battleships jumpdrive is destroyed and or the engines are damaged to the point you can't save the pride and joy of your armada. The battle begins to shift in your favor as your fast, heavily armed, corvette class ship squadron breaks off of their sector to sector patrolling to aid in your fight. They exit the jump gate into the system and begin wiping the enemy out of existance almost effortlessly, using their own single scout ships for coverfire or as extra moving sheilds. Missles, laser light bolts, ships, debris, asteroids, even foolish trader and passenger ships fly by your view as the battle rages on.After a few more intense moments... the enemy system is now yous to plunder and take over. You have your corvette class ships go in for repairs and then back on their patrols to keep the errant pirates or alien ships from messing with your trade routes and freighters and stations. You send out your carriers wing of heavy freighters to search and pick up all the spoils of battle. Bringing you back enough supplies and parts to not only upgrade, and repair your damaged ships but to buy you a second battleship.And when the battle is over you now have fame! Every distressed system in the universe wants your help! After re-arming and repairs, you head off for yet another intense and extreme space battle... where there is no right side up or down, and there is no gravity to slow you down. The enemy can, and will, attack from every possible angle... And this time, they know your weakspot... and the enemy heads right for your prized carrier in a kamakaze style attack... It's time to get in your personal, customized, one of a kind corvette class ship and help with taking down the enemy in the hopes you will be able to get your carrier to limp out of the battle and to a station for repairs before it gets destroyed completely.Now it's time to be sneaky and use underhanded tactics such as hiding in asteroid tunnels and blasting anyone that flys by. Or using the sun in that system as visual cover for your ship while you come roaring by, blasting everything that moves. Strafing, sliding, barrel rolls. Making your fast and heavily sheilded corvette class ship a big enough of a threat to the enemy that most of them break off the attack on your wounded carrier, giving it enough time to limp its way to a jump gate and get to a protected and friendly star system.You also send your other ships along with it... It's now you and your corvette class ship and it's single docked medium fighter against 10 enemy battleships , 4 enemy carriers, and hundreds of every size enemy fighter coming to splatter your atoms all over the universe... You can run for your life... Die (surrender is not an option)... or... you can turn up your heavy metal battle music, grin, and charge full speed at the unstopable hoards of enemy fighters and capital ships and damage and destroy as many of the smaller ships as possible by getting them to crash into each other or follow you into an asteriod tunnel network and have them crash into the rock walls in the darkness before blasting out of the ateroid with a huge fireball following you, leaving the battle and jumping to another system while the enemy now fears you... it's your choice... there is no commander to give you orders... there is no structured storyline to hide in and recover for a while...

This remake pales in comparison, and smacks of a desperate attempt by a design team to get a few extra bucks out of a franchise.First and foremost, there are bugs galore in the game. Serious bugs. Bugs that make you reset the PS2 (although I've heard that some have even had to restart their games, I've never experienced this). This is unacceptable. I don't care how good the source material is, it's shoddy and unprofessional to rush something with a price like this.Which brings me back to my original point - the source material has already been published, and can be found for a lower price than the remake. All that is given here are better graphics (though they're nothing to write home about - for the time, ""Wild Arms"" for the PS1 had very nice graphics. The same is not true for ""Alter Code""), some extra characters (which cannot be accessed until late in the game), and a couple of extra dungeons. What's more, the battle sequences in the remake are much poorer than the original offering, and much MUCH more annoying. They are over-long and often very tedious.Sorry, but I don't see the love for this imitation. Bugs, design issues (the surprise encounter rate is ridiculous - but only when your characters are of a high enough level to avoid most encounters), and just general sloppiness make this one of the more tired RPG's I've played.

If you haven't played the old X-Com, this is a squad combat game where your troops progress in equipment and skills as you fight your way through a series of battles.  Combat is turn-based, and troops can retain the ability to react to enemy movements by not using up all of their time on a turn.There are some definite improvements on the original.  First off, the game looks great.  The cut scenes are excellent and the combat zones look great.  There's a somewhat limited view, but that's because you see only what your squad sees.  The special abilities of your troops make for an even better strategy experience in combat.  Some troops can finish their action with a shot, giving you a chance to point-blank the enemy if they've moved.  Some are pointmen due to their reflexes, some snipers, some heavy weapons.  The game rewards planning and using your mix of skills properly.  The terrain is deformable, i.e. you can blow stuff up.  This was a big part of the original.  Why search a building for the enemy when you have a rocket launcher to blow the walls off?  It's fun (and effective).It's not a perfect game.  The 'top' part of the game, the overall strategy, is much less flexible and involved than it used to be.  For most players this is probably a plus, but some will miss it, especially base design.  On the other hand, no more picking up clips and doing other scrounging or inventory management and packing.  The game is not going to be as long some other X-box titles, but hopefully there will be DLC to add to the play life of X-Com.All in all this is the game X-Com fans have anticipated for a decade or more now.

I can't understand why they changed the controls for batting. It makes it frustrating to get through. Instead of the swooping swing of the right stick to control the bat, power hitting is now just down and up which feels like it throws your time off. You're either EARLY, VERY EARLY, LATE or VERY LATE. You can't control the direction you want to hit it in anymore, that's been replaced with a fight-off-pitch feature, and if you just hit for contact, which makes it easier to time the pitch, you end up blooping it, or grounding it to the Short Stop or the Second Baseman.Another problem I had with it is the defensive part. You pitch the ball, the guy on first goes to steal second. So far, no matter how fast the ball gets off from the catcher, even if the pitcher throws a fastball, you NEVER get this guy out, even when the ball gets there first. He just magically slides in behind it. On more than one occasion, I've had a batter hit a weak pop-up just over my second baseman's head. In 2K9, you could run your second baseman after it, because your right fielder is too far out. Not in this game. In this game, the second baseman runs out so far, then, for some reason, will just STOP and run back to where he's supposed to be, turning an out into single or a double. I've just finished a game where I had a ball hit into right field, and instead of charging the ball, I couldn't make him move. He just stood there and waited for the ball to take its time and roll to him. So much for a quick throw to first.Another fault I've notices is the check-swing. I've been robbed of a lot of hits, because I send the stick up from the down position for a Power Swing, and it gives me a check swing, which gives me a strike. I can't tell you how many times this has happened. It's all the time now. And the stick is all the way up. I thought it was me but it's not. It drives me nuts!MLB2K10 may look better, but it doesn't play anywhere near as well as 2K9 did.

The combat system is very well done in which you choose your armor, weapons, magic rings/amulets, and spells in a menu and can change these based on what you go into combat with.  The countless possibilities of combinations are numberless, and there is a slight variation in quests each time you play.The theme is basically a medieval one in which you venture deep into an underground labyrinth to battle monsters and such that you've heard about, and you end up having to face monsters of mammoth proportions (The Butcher), Magical Skill (Lazarus), and a combination (Diablo).  The game really shouldn't be intended for kids that are at an age where gore and such could sicken one, as there are themes of death, sacrifice, and unholiness in the game.I found the game very enjoyable however, and at the moment it's at a bargain price.  If you have played Diablo II already, you'd probably like the first Diablo, although Diablo II is much better.  I'd still suggest playing the first one before taking on Diablo II.  There are numerous spells and such that you can learn to aid you on your quest, and items appear randomly after battling Monster bosses (regular monsters with special powers...i.e. one with magic resistances).  The game implores you to learn the lay out of the dungeon, and you begin to press deeper into the valleys of heck.The degree of difficulty is not too bad, where after you get used to the game, you realize that all you really need is time to beat it, and plenty of saves.  The usefulness of the shops and magic items also turns the tides against darkness in your favor.

You rappel down a highrise and are treated to a really expansive view. All of this is really nice but the bland not quite last generation graphics don't do any of it a justice. The textures just don't pop and many of the enemies and bystanders look like they came from a PS2 game.The controls in this game are an issue as well. The cover system seems random and works when it feels like it. I can't understand why this game didn't include a cover button instead. The aiming feels off as well and there are times when it appears that you hit someone but the shot doesn't register. This wouldn't be so bad but certain missions have you shooting at people speeding by in bulldozers and helicopters. That said, the command system is fairly well done but the A.I. doesn't always respond in the way that you would like. It really is frustrating to send someone to a strategic vantage point only for them to abandon it in favor of running into a hail gunfire. This too wouldn't be so bad but if one of your teammates dies, it's back to the previous checkpoint unless you can make a quick suicidal rescue attempt.IO Interactive is making a sequel to this along with the movie which is fine by me. I hope they learn from this release and make a much better game for it.Personally, what I want from them more than anything, is to make a sequel to Freedom Fighters. When I first played through the Havana level in Kane and Lynch, I realized this game blatantly copies that games command system and controls. That would be all well and good but that game was released on the PS2 in 2003 and was actually a much better game. So in closing, buy Freedom Fighters instead of this and pray they bring that series back or maybe a next gen Hitman game that isn't some lame port of an X Box game. I purchased this game for around four dollars with another four with shipping. I'm not terribly upset about my purchase but I would be furious at buying this short, generic, unfinished game at full retail. Playing cops and robbers was kinda fun but not sixty dollars worth of it. This game really isn't as terrible as some of the reviewers here say but  I think I'll wait for Kane and Lynch 2 to hit the bargain bins before picking it up.",3,*@#$#!! Seriously!

9271,68712,A1YRS2JSQQ99IO,B000FQ2D5E,Steven Rinck,"[1, 10]","I've been a fan of the series all along (you can view some of my previous reviews), so keep in mind this review is someone who has been a fan of the series all along.  I have played every canon metal gear game up to the point of this one's release (ie every MSX/playstation/PSP release except the acid series), and even some that weren't.  It's hard for me to say this....but this game is not that good.GRAPHICSNothing wrong here.  In face, it's some of the best I've ever seen.MECHANICSThis is my major gripe.  Metal Gear is a game focusing on stealth.  Traditionally in the series, you get past enemies by either avoiding them entirely, or separating them and taking them down before they're aware of you; Aka direct combat is usually either a set-piece / boss battle, or punishment for screwing up.  This game punishes the hell out of you.- Camouflage is 100% useless.  Even with a 95% rating, lying prone and unmoving you will constantly be spotted by guards from far away.  If they have line of sight to you (and they all have about about 270 degrees of sight), they will spot you instantly, even from a great distance.- Most means of evading enemies once spotted don't work (ie lockers, cardboard box etc).  I tried utilizing them 100s of times (not after being spotted; ie when they find a dead body three rooms over), and NONE OF THEM EVER WORKED EVEN ONCE.  All enemies make a Bee-line for your current position (even if you're not spotted, but they see a clue like a downed body).  Usually changing areas or crawling into a vent unnoticed are the only means of escaping detection.  When detected in most areas, enemies will spawn and attack you indefinitely; no such thing as cleaning out the area.  Cardboard boxes didn't even help me evade detection when I wasn't in a caution/alert mode and was tucked into a corner with other actual cardboard boxes.- Enemies are very frequently scripted to do things when you're getting close (not because they detect you, but merely because you're at a certain point in the game) like modifying their patrol routes, checking out the passage you're coming down etc.  In order to get by undetected you usually have to know the change in their behavior is about to happen so you can trigger it and immediately move to a place that avoids or counters their changed behavior.  Reacting to the situation in progress without coming to blows is almost impossible, excepting if you are very quick with the mk22 tranq pistol (which I was, but see below).- While the game may look like multiple paths exist...they really don't.  Almost anytime there's a branching path, every path but one has an infinite enemy-respawn at that point.  This either leads to a never-ending battle, or the ridiculousness of having DOZENS of sleeping enemies (if you go the tranq route and are a quick shot) because one, two or three immediately run around from the corner the instant you eliminate/tranq a guy...until they all start waking up...and then you've got the never ending battle again.- You can be trying to hide in the ranks of an advancing militia, but the moment *you* fire a shot (even if you kill the guy and no other enemy has line of sight to you) the entire PMC goes into alert mode and starts spawning enemies to come after *you*.- I frequently found it easier, even on the higher difficulties (that's right, I played it again...I really, really wanted to like this game) to just run through crowds of enemies instead of making any attempt at stealth.In short, the gameplay is lousy.  The worst in the entire series except for Portable Ops (and that is lousy mostly because of the limited PSP controls).PRESENTATIONMost other reviewers mention the cutscenes.  Metal gear has always been long-winded.  The series has always been wordy (even the early MSX games had pages of dialogue in an era where most games had 1-2 sentences). but this takes it to ridiculous levels.  I still can't tell if the ending of the game is a parody or not; in one scene a dying man appears to pass away no less than 10 times during a 45 minute monologue, only to start talking again.  The game will spend a 30 minute cut scene to give you 10 seconds of information.  Even skipping cutscenes (just because of the loading between each one) can make you spend upwards of 10 minutes between gameplay sequences.  This game took me over 40 hours on my first playthrough, and less than 6 on my second (harder difficulty) playthrough where I skipped cutscenes.PLOTI thought it would be hard to get worse than MGS2 in this department.  The game does finally explain away many plot threads it's been hinting at for 10 years (and by hinting I mean hammering you in the face with, but with critical bits conflicting or incomplete).  The plot in this one is unbelievably dumb.  I mean that in the literal sense.  You know how in some games enemies do stupid things like stock large amount of clearly-labeled barrels of high-explosives for no reason and then use them to take cover behind in a fire fight?  Stretch that level of stupid out into a 25-hour narrative arc and you've got the main plot thread for this game.  Many of these revelations are disappointing and feel pulled out of thin air, but at least they're resolved.  Well, most of them are.  I still can't fully understand what the whole Liquid-Ocelot story is.  Many of the character motivations are completely screwy at the conclusion, not to mention one character's in particular is in complete contradiction to events at the finale of the game.  Without spoiling the feature-film length ending: the game (I mean entire Metal Gear Series) teased at the ending it deserved, and then blew past it to ruin it.To reference previous games in the series...I had high hopes for the ending of this, especially after the Masterpiece that is MGS3.  Sadly, this game took *everything* that was wrong with MGS2's story, pumped it full of steroids (or should I say nanomachines?) and ruined every good thing about the gameplay it had been developing since the first playstation release.

If I had any gripes, it'd have to be with the graphics. Although they were better than any previous Gauntlet released, I still don't think they harnessed the true power of the Playstation2.

I noticed that even for a 2003 game it was pretty pricey even if you get it used.I thought the game was done exceptionally well and would have rated very high when it was first released.  It's a typical futuristic FPS in the tradition of HalfLife.  There are a sequence of missions woven together by a story line with three endings to choose from.  You can play all three, of course.You start each mission by equipping your guy with a limited amount of weapons, ammo, and equipment.  You can also get weapons, ammo, and health packs from dead enemies.  Weapons include the traditional array of pistols, sub machine guns, sniper riffles, assault weapons, rocket launchers, and energy weapons, with an accompanying assortment of ammo.  To be honest, I never even used the energy weapons, because they were apparently short range weapons.  Importantly, some weapons are silenced and stealth is a required strategy on some missions.  Equipment includes health packs, binoculars and a cloaking device.  There can select a default load if you don't want to select everything manually.Objectives and places you have to go are shown on a map and directional guidance is provided by a compass on the HUD.  This is a sandbox style game, so you can wander all over on your approach to a particular target.  There are a few different types of vehicles including ""walkers"".  There are also fixed turrets that you can use.You get guidance through each mission via radio from your partner, a sexy blond (an essential and always appreciated ingredient in any good sci-fi computer game).I loaded two patches.  1.1.3.0-v2 and 1.2.0.0.  Movement was smooth and graphics, old, but clean.  I had a couple functionality issues.  Game saves started taking a long time toward the end of the game.  Then on the second ending, the game just kept crashing no matter what SAVE game I loaded up.  By restarting the game and then restarting the level from the beginning, all problems went away and it worked fine.  There are no graphics modes that fit my 16x10 aspect ratio and the subtitles disappeared off the bottom of the screen.  That was only a minor annoyance, though.My 5-star rating is based on what I would have given it back when it was first released, but it's enjoyable even in 2009.

This game felt like it was basically rushed into production long before they could do justice to it and make it a truly challenging, engrossing, and expansive game like the Civil war theme deserves.Pluses: The period weapons were very neat. Um - I guess that's about it.Minuses: The gameplay stinks. You basically just move down a prescribed path (no free-roaming or wandering or approaching from different angles like in Operation Flashpoint) where enemies just come at you, fire at you, and stupidly try to reload their guns in plain sight of you (so you can just gun them down). You're mostly on your own, and even the guys on your side mostly just do their own thing and ignore you - so it's not like you are part of a squad trying to do something or a leader of a detachment tasked with a mission. You just wander around completing missions like blowing up a cannon, then stealing a document, then delivering it to your commander, etc. There is no feeling of being in the middle of the line as the enemy charges your position, or conversely, charging the enemy as part of a huge division while the enemy is encamped behind a wall on a hill, which is what most actual Civil War combat was all about. If you were a cavalryman where most of the time you WERE out as part of a small detachment doing raids, reconaissance and other unconventional tasks, then it would make sense, but the game depicts you as a regular foot soldier.Also, most of the weapons of this period were single-shot musket-rifles. Repeaters like the Henry, Spencer and such were in extremely short supply, but this game makes it seem like they were the rule rather than the exception.Still, some of the gameplay was pretty fun, such as Gettysburg and Chattanooga, because those battles were depicted fairly well, but most of the other battles were pretty worthless, IMO.",2,Very Disappointing,1231027200,"01 4, 2009"

4719,116399,ADJKMC7AO7YN3,B001IK1BJ0,Amazon Customer,"[0, 1]","It's really hard to sum up an all inclusive review on a game that is so deep and expansive with all the other reviews before it, but I'm going to give it the old college try anyway.Dragon Age: Origins can be considered a spiritual successor to some degree of the classic PC based Baldur's Gate.  Like most RPG's it is set in a medieval/fantasy realm where the land and it's kingdom have befallen to a demonic presence and it's up to you and your chosen party (you can change your group makeup throughout the game) like so many clich&eacute; games of this genre before it to bring justice to those that betrayed the fallen king, rid the realm of demons, and of course all the requisite side quests along the way.The main thing this game has going for it is of course it has been developed by BioWare.  BioWare is considered to be one of the best developers of said type of game and their track record of great games assures this to be another hit.What you can always expect in BioWare games is great writing and depth.  They really prevail in immersing the player in a well thought out world where the aspects of religion, politics, interpersonal relationships between characters and NPC's .  For those that are fans of deep RPG's, this should be right up your alley.  However, I also find that this can be a hindrance to some along with the casual player.  The story at times is almost too deep, and there are periods of time where the action is interrupted abruptly by numerous cut scenes, very expansive dialogue tree conversations, and encyclopedic like entries on discovered notes and quests.  It feels disjointed at time to be hacking and slashing one second, just to end up reading endless text passages the next that seem to drag on for lengthy periods of time.Depending on what school of gamer you are, again, the back story, quest lore, and cryptic notes that are discovered and placed in your Codex (think detailed personal journal) can get ridiculous at times.  While its great to have detail, I also believe developers need to walk a fine line in not supplying so much the player feels overwhelmed with tons of ingame texts.  There are times I feel like I am just reading and reading and reading, just to make sure I'm not missing one small clue.  One other complaint I have is that the text can seem small at times.  Even on a large 42"" TV, I feel I'm straining to read the `fine print'.Quests are the usual sort that is typical for this style of game and there are some unique twists and puzzles along the way that keep you engaged.  Boss battles do feel epic and skirmishes can be fast paced and rewarding.  On the flip side, some quests can also feel to drawn out, or multiple prerequisites and/or sub quests must be completed before the story progresses.  In one example (non-spoiler) in order to save a possessed boy as part of the main story arc, you are shunted over to a mage infested zone for a clue only to then be sent to liberate a tower for the mages.  Once at the tower, and questing through that, you must rescue your party in a whole new deep puzzle laden zone to acquire yet another item to liberate the tower.  In other words, in order to move forward in main quest `A', you must do `B', which requires you also complete `C, D, E' to get item `F'.  Before you know it, you can't even remember what `A' was to begin with.  Not all quests are like this.  There are plenty of isolated smaller quests and random encounters, but the epic ones are fairly involved and sometimes I began to wonder when does it end and I get to get back on track.Graphics are above average, but not perfect.  There are some occasional glitches where body parts disappear into others, body movement can be wooden, and lip synching is off.  There are some graphical inconsistencies as well.  You may equip a certain helm or item on your person, and depending on the cut scene or camera angle, you are wearing it one second, and not the next, only for it to reappear again later.Inventory management is `okay' but can be frustrating at times.  You have only so many slots to carry loot with the option to sell it to a merchant, augment it, or equip it.  The problem comes from the longer quests (see example above) where the ability to visit a merchant is not available for quite some time, so the player must decide what to take and what to leave behind or destroy.  I would have like the chance to sell it to a merchant, or carry more, but at times you are limited and thus you have to leave some loot behind in areas which you'll never come back to.  There is a `move to junk' option which is nice, in which you can sell everything labeled `junk' to a merchant, but in my case I had to destroy items to make room in my inventory slots to carry other stuff.  This equates to lost in game money.Character progression and leveling is well rounded and it's good to have a mix of party members, although I'd also argue that some of the `talents' one can specialize have very vague descriptions in some cases and too many options in others.  The actual manual that comes with the game is sparse on details, so you rely on in game descriptions, and sometimes you have no idea what a spell/talent does until you commit to them...and you can't undo once you've committed.  Again, because the manual can be vague (unlike the endless notes, clues, and lore) there is a fair amount of trial and error on learning how to craft, use items, and their effects within the game.  This also goes for NPC tactics you can assign and customize for each character.  Explanation and examples within the manual are virtually not existent, leaving you as the player to muddle through this on your own if you feel so inclined.  It adds a great layer of additional customization and minute controls over party actions, but figuring it out on your own can be daunting.  I suspect many will just leave the defaults as they are.EA and BioWare have done a great job in supporting and providing plenty of DLC.  As of this writing of this review, there has already been at least 1 hefty expansion available as well as other `episodic'-like content that can add additional hours, loot, spells, etc.  This is on top of a game that is already very long and deep out of its initial package.Finally combat:  I'm reviewing the game for the Xbox 360, so all your controls are handled by the controller and not a keyboard.  While the `command wheel', somewhat similar in nature to the one you use in Mass Effect, isn't always as intuitive in the heat of battle as one would like.  Using a combination of both triggers, shoulder buttons, and analog stick, you can temporarily pause the game and issue orders/behaviors for your party (or you can take control of any of them at any time).  But when battles get intense, this can be somewhat unwieldy to use.  Sometimes it's hard to determine who is doing what when there is a lot happening on the screen.  Visual effects can sometimes block your visual cues and get in the way of determining what actions are taking place....this is where I find a traditional PC keyboard and mouse more favorable.  You can still get the job done, but extra attention is needed when using a console controller.Overall, the game is very good and deep.  This is a true RPG that feels `huge' and that's without the expansions.  Spoken dialogue and stories sound very professional although feel at times not as original as they could have been.  The Xbox handles the action quite well, but close up cut scenes don't feel natural as the characters seem stiff and jerky with un-synched speech and graphical continuity gaffs.  Text is a bit small at times and the balance between fast paced action and drawn out explanations in text trees or spoken word can take some time getting used too.",4,"Epic and deep in scope, but needs a bit of polish",1271635200,"04 19, 2010"
1028,21972,A37DLZMMT4AKEG,B00005O0I3,Gabriel Perdue,"[3, 3]","Dead or Alive 3 is a fast paced and graphically outstanding fighting game.  The game is three dimensional and the comabt is based on a mix of punches, kicks, throws, and counters - moves that catch punches and kicks and reverse them, usually damaging the opponent.The standard mix of modes are available: story or arcade mode, versus mode, a practice mode, team battles, a timed attack mode (beat eight enemies as fast as you can), and a survival mode (beat as many enemies as you can before you fall).  There are ""tag battle"" modes available in the versus mode, which allows you to control two characters and tag them in and out during a fight.  You can even get them both on the screen at once for special combo attacks.Graphically, Dead or Alive 3 is one of the ost stunning games made thus far.  The visuals are absolutely breathtaking.Dead or Alive 3 has one, major flaw: it is not very deep.  Well, actually, that isn't fair, the depth is there, but it is nearly inaccessible.  Good fighting games are built on strategies that go several layers deep and we have that in DOA3.  Counters can defeat punches and  kicks, throws can defeat counters, and strikes can defeat throws.  The different characters all have a huge assortment of moves in each category and each move does varying amounts of damage and works at varying ranges.  Furthermore, none of the characters are broken or unfair, so all the elements are there for an outstanding fighting system.  Unfortunately, the game is too bloody fast and the moves are too hard to do.  This observation may just be a reflection on my skill as a gamer, but I don't believe it is.  The pace of the combat is simply too fast and the number of options is simply too large to allow combat to evolve very far from button mashing.DOA3 is still a lot of fun to play with your friends, and its lack of real depth actually keeps the game balanced between veterans and beginners.  Veterans will definitely have the edge as they will be able to get at some the depth that should be there and exploit strategies the beginners can't, but anyone can still fall sometimes to some wild button mashing.All in all, if you really have to have a fighter, you'll be able to enjoy DOA3 as a quick fix for your addiction, but it won't provide the sort of lasting satisfaction and near infinite replay value that some of the classic fighting games have given us.",3,"Flashy and sexy, but not very deep",1007078400,"11 30, 2001"

The controls are terrible. Possibly the worst I have used. I could definately see how this would be far better on a computer, but it could have been done better on a console as well. Getting the troops to move where you want them to is tedious at best. However the game does offer some chalenging game play and is the closest thing you will likely find to a strategy warefare game on the 360. This is basically a RTS (or more accurately an RTM -Real Time Micro-management- because lets face it, there is virtually no strategy involved in those games. It is all about micro management) with a couple key differences. It gives you the ability to pause and servey the battle field and direct your troops any time you want. This is a huge advantage over other micromanagement games. Also, there is considerably more strategy involved, though it is simple (use archers agains poorly armoured troops, put heavily armoured troops in front of archers, use pikes and halbards against cavalry, cavalry against archers, etc.). However, there are not nearly enough cases where you can effectively use terain to your advantage. No seiges, no castles, no seige equipment, and the best equipment does not even become available til half or even more than half way through the game. The game actually gets easier as it goes on because you learn what works, and can upgrade your army. It would have been better if they made most of it available from the begining and challenged the player through varying tactical scenarious.I could have done with out the whole leveling up aspect of the game, though it is kind of cool watching your troops become more powerful until they can level other inferior forces in seconds. You are given options as how to aply experience points which depends on what kind of troops they are. What you choose depends on how they are armed, which, again, adds a bit of strategy and planning beyond that found in typical RTM games. It took me a while to get past the tediousness of the movement and focus more on the strategy, but after you get past that it is well worth it. Which brings us to the next point. Price.I purchased this game used for $20. and think that is a fair price for the game. There is not a lot to it, you can't make your own maps, you can't even use an army you have created to play short battles outside of the campain. This would have been a no brainer. Or composing your own battles, choosing armies and weaponry on each side. They could have done a lot more in that regard, making the single battle option fun, instead of just mostly worthless. I played the English campain through twice, once on medium and once on difficult. There is not much difference from what I can tell. But you can make the game more challenging by simply using less troops, and figuring out a strategy to make it work. All in all I would say this is a good game and far under rated. I suppose most people don't want to be challenged in a strategic maner with video games. Too bad because I would really like to see more of this stuff with some improvements and more of a focus on different maps, varied terrain and generaly more strategy and tactics.In short, if you like to be challenged mentally, and like actual strategy games, but don't feel like playing chess, I would suggest giving this one a try. I actually think it is one of the better games I have played recently, though to be fair, I don't really play a lot of games.",3,Closest thing to an actual strategy game I have played on a console,1354320000,"12 1, 2012"

7351,175509,A2BZ4HSRBB5V6A,B004P8GL60,Michael,"[43, 56]","You've probably read better reviews elsewhere, but, nevertheless:NCAA '12 is a solid game, through and through, but it doesn't introduce very many new exciting ""back of the box features,"" though it does improve on the core gameplay, Dynasty, and Road to Glory modes from NCAA '11.  Without a doubt, the game is MUCH better ""shipped"" than NCAA '11 was -- which had recruiting glitches, tuner necessities, patches, and all sorts of stuff before it even became playable.  NCAA '12 is solid out of the box.The changes to Dynasty mode are appreciated, mostly, the Coaching Carousel enhancement which really let's you live out as a certain type of coach -- working your way up from a coordinator where you only control half of the on-field action, all the way to a head coach.  The mode isn't completely flushed out, but it's fun and rewarded, with a 'goal oriented' design that rewards you not just for long term success, but for small in-season successes.  Perhaps next year it can be improved with micro-enhancements within each game, like rewarding your team for playing with good sportsmanship, spreading the ball around, or bringing in other players into the offense.  Additionally, full conference editing is a great addition, which will allow history junkies to recreate conferences and matchups from year's past, or replicate future changes.  Conveniently, this also allows for better custom team integration.Other than that, Dynasty mode hasn't dramatically changed, which isn't a bad thing -- NCAA 11's dynasty mode was the most addictive that the series has ever had.Road to Glory is fine, but still lame... it's not ""Road to the Show,"" from MLB The Show series, but it's not bad either.  It takes very little work to quickly become the best at your position, and so the challenge really isn't there, but at the same time, you never quite feel like you're ""grinding"" like you do in the expansive, but tedious, Road to the Show.Unfortunately, some modes got completely left out.  Online play is identical, Online Dynasty is relatively unchanged except for the additions made to offline -- and the only new additions to online dynasty itself are either locked until August 1st (lame?) or sit behind a pay wall, which is similarly lame.  Adding new features but making you pay small amounts for them is really not okay, because consumers are still paying $60 each year -- it's not like we're only paying $4 here and there for new features like Coaching Carousel, and not paying ~$50 for the features that remain the same from NCAA '11.  I'd appreciate it if EA thought about this mentality more:  IF they're going to charge additionally (on top of the $60) for ""enhancements"" and ""new features,"" then it would be consistent for them to NOT charge for the features that stay the same.  I understand they're trying to maximize profits in unique ways, especially in a down economy, but, c'mon, stop nickle and dimming the hardcore customers.To casual players, gameplay won't feel changed, but to those who have played these games a lot, you'll notice key differences.  A new tackling engine removes suction tackling, which is a great addition that pays immediate dividends for the game:  The game feels more organic than it ever has, which is really nice.  Still, this engine makes for a few new 'skating' animations, where players see a burst of speed breaking free from a tackle.  It's not the end of the world, but it's noticeable occasionally.  Other than the tackling, the defense has been balanced so you'll need to mix up zone and man coverage, as opposed to NCAA '11 where zone coverage was completely useless, so you could play a Cover 2 for the entire game.  Zone coverage works and it's refreshing.  The defensive line pressure is effective, the most effective perhaps in the history of Tiburon-engine football games, so you see far more d-line sacks, which is really refreshing.  Offense hasn't wholly changed, but everything feels good... QB's aren't as accurate, but at the same time, DBs don't mirror routes anymore.Playcalling is still EA's broken playcall philosophy where the CPU has psychic abilities to read your plays, and then randomly chooses their play based off of what you pick.  This is still obvious in any fake situation, any goal line run or pass, and any situation where you're trying to 'trick' the CPU with a clever playcall.  It's all psychic playcalling with built in randomized ""mistake"" generators, which is lame.  But, this is par for the course with EA games and if it's never bothered you before, it won't bother you now.Graphics are excellent.  This is the best looking football game ever, probably.  Improvements to grass, replies, presentation, and everything else, are much appreciated.The sound is, still, terrible.  Stadiums sound good, crowds are nice although mostly unchanged, but the commentary is the same that it has been since the PS2 era, and it's basically identical to what it was last year.  The same canned remarks, the same lousy analysis of plays, the same things you've come to hear thousands of times.  If you've never played one of these games, you'd think that the commentary is fresh and great.  But if you've played any NCAA Football game in the last 5 years, you'll hear lines recorded from 5+ years ago just recycled ad nauseam.I'm hitting some negatives in this review, but honestly, the game is an improvement over NCAA '11, which was the best NCAA Football game -- perhaps -- ever released, and the best football game from last year.  It's still an EA engine game and it's still got some of the same frustrations that have plagued these games, but really, its an improvement on an already solid product, and so if you've liked these games before, you'll still really like NCAA Football '12.",4,"Solid Showing, but not much that's new",1310688000,"07 15, 2011"

Lambeth,"[1, 1]","I thought the graphics and game control were every bit as good as anything in the Modern Warfare series (which are the games that introduced me to the genre), but what pushed this title to the top of my own preferential list was the storyline and diversity that Medal of Honor offered. Instead of some unlikely World War 3 scenario with a rogue Russian madman (Modern Warfare 1 & 2), Medal of Honor is situated in the very real theatre of Afghanistan in the free world vs. Al Qaida and the Taliban. I think this injection of a real-to-life situation is a vast improvement to the world of fist-person-shooters.As far as the diversity of play is concerned, the player-characters range from a special-ops teammate to a ""regular"" Army Ranger to an attack helicopter pilot etc. Player characters also get to drive ATVs and snipe and stage stealth attacks in addition to the regular run-and-gun sessions that define this genre.Another piece of the game that makes it absolutely superb is the sense of camaraderie for the OTHER teammates in the special-ops/ SEAL team. As a player, I found that these other guys really seemed to ""care"" for my player character. I also found myself wanting to do a ""good job"" for them in battle, covering their flanks and supporting them as much as possible. Knowing in my head that it was all a synthetic video game didn't keep me from connecting with the other characters in a peculiar way. This sort of thing is exactly what separates the good from the great when it comes to video games. Well done, DICE and Electronic Arts; I am a convert from the Modern Warfare franchise.My ONLY gripe is that the campaign mode was too short. This is a universal problem amongst otherwise fantastic first-person-shooters including the Modern Warfare series.

In some ways, it's better than last year, but in many ways, it's actually inferior. For one, there's all this music in the game, including the theme songs for a few of the recent PPVs, but you can't use them for your CAWs entrances. What's that about? I can't afford to download all my songs on my list and port them to my PS3 for that, I just have too many.I also got my wish of getting the Abilities system back, but until I get a word somewhere about how to unlock them, they gypped CAWs in that department, not allowing them to have Resiliency and the like right off the bat, when you get mostly useless abilities if the ones that are availiable to them right away aren't the ones you want them to have. I mean, what were they thinking? Last year, we had to unlock them and you could start Career Mode with an actual Superstar or Diva to find out what you need to do to get them. This year, you can change them to suit your whims, but even if you do Career Mode with someone who is there, they don't freakin' tell you what you need to do to get them! Although, there are abilities that weren't in there last year.And why is it that half the single player Road to WrestleMania stories are for unrepentant heels? Seriously. Edge and Randy Orton are two of the characters you can use in RtWM, and in both stories, they're as intolerable as ever. In fact, Randy Orton's story has Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase making an even worse heel turn, and they keep Orton the same. I mean come on, if that were to happen on the actual shows, Randy Orton would be cast into a face role. Or, if they wanted Orton to stay the same, it'd be DiBiase and Rhodes making the face turn, but not here. Their characters all just get worse. What were they thinking?!And why is it that the music that plays when you're doing anything but playing matches and making your own stories that of heels? I don't want to see The Miz, so what makes them think I want to hear his music? I can't bloody stand any of them who are heels whose music they chose for that. Mark Henry and MVP don't count because they're faces on the actual shows despite still being heels in this game.And where do they get off putting us on a points system for our CAWs? 48 points. That's what we get, and if we can't get the desired look with that, then we can't have the person we wanted to create. They may look like they're actually people who are there, but they're not as flashy as the real ones. Oh, and the Paint Tool is no help if you're not good at art. Still, I favor more simple character designs, so for many of them I could create, 48 points is more than enough.Inclusion of Legends like The Rock, Cowboy Bob Orton, and the Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase is a nice touch, though. Even if you can't use them in Road to WrestleMania. Seriously. They got the Million Dollar Man and Dusty Rhodes to do voices in this game, so why couldn't they have a Legends Road to WrestleMania and have one or both of them be the ones? And since we're on the subject of RtWM again, I think it should be mentioned that the only Diva you can use in that mode is Mickie James. And yes, Stone Cold Steve Austin was only available through GameStop. Sorry.But it's WWE, and you can have your CAWs become champions. That's good, especially when you consider all the titles up for grabs in this game compared to previous iterations. Seriously, you could have one of your CAWs become Champion of Champions.And on the subject of CAWs, if you use them in any match, not just Career Mode, they gain ability points which you use to increase their skills. To improve said skills, they have to level up. To level up said skills, you have to consistently have them do that in matches.You may be noticing a pattern here. I'm mostly focusing on the negative things. That's because they didn't make enough good choices! I actually prefer SvR 2009, and that game is horrible compared to previous SVR entries. Not nearly as jacked up as SvR 2010, though. I am seriously disappointed with this game. I am not kidding when I say this game is brand new, but already I'm eager for SvR 2011.

There is simply not a lot of replay value here.I suppose that they were in a rush to get this highly anticipated game out before Christmas but this is a change from Valve's typical policy which is ""It will ship when it's done"".  But, the content that is here is highly polished and the levels are decently populated with trash and overturned vehicles.  The zombies are well balanced difficulty depending on the skill of the Human players and indicators are very helpful at helping new players get up to speed.Once you've played for about 10 hours there's not much more to discover...Edit (long-term impression):  This game does have its moments.  Like I said the balance is pretty good in verses mode.  The game can be very intense at moments to the point where you are shouting out loud or jumping out of your seat.

I had some fun with the PSP version so I rented this title for my PS3.  I was very disappointed.As you probably already know, Ridge Racer is an unconventional racing game in that you must master the drifting (letting your car slide through corners) in order to win the races.  In other words, you cannot hope to win any race without adequate drifting (which in turn gives you nitrous boosts).  While mastering drifting is not hard for the average racing fan such as yours truly, the technique gets tiring quickly.  It's pretty much the same thing every time, and after a few races you'll probably come to dread cornering rather than enjoying the racing.So gameplay is problematic.  You may also take issues with the fact that none of the cars modelled in RR is a real car.  Instead they bear such silly names like Age, Absoluto, etc.  This is not surprising given that the kind of drifting advocated in RR is not real at all and there's absolutely no real-world physics involved.For a PS3 game, the graphics is terrible.  While frame rate is good, the tracks (which are probably rehashed from previous RR games, a common practice in the RR series) are surprisingly low-res.  This is apparently so when you compare RR's graphics with that of the Gran Turismo HD Concept demo, which is can be downloaded free from the PS3 store.  There are very few environmental effects, and the tracks feel way too generic and unexciting.I absolutely advise against paying the big bucks for this game.  If you want to relive the RR drift racing or what to give drifting a try, rent the title or find a demo.  In fact, you'll probably get more satisfaction from a PS2 version of the RR series since you'll be paying much less for the game.",2,Poor graphics and unconventional arcade driving = poor game,1170028800,"01 29, 2007"

You get to follow orders from a director who demands you do some of the most stupidly rigorous tasks to complete stunts. Some of the stunts are cool, but the game gets hard at about the 4th level. The first movie you shoot is like a tutorial. I rented this game, and never beat it. The first level of the first real movie in which your basically like dukes of hazards is tremendously hard. You have to do things in split seconds, and the game is so hard that it is frustrating. The game has no good points that I can think of. On one of the first missions I didn't barrel roll and I still won it. Another time I was suppose to hit a  board and spin sideways near a garbage can, I barely did it and I won.But once you get to the dukes of hazards type movie, no. It's ridiculously stupid. There are cooling towers in random places falling on your car. Then you have to jump through a train at the start which is kinda luck. Anyways, the game could of gotten things right. For one, the game is fun when your not all stuntman. Right after you jump over a house, you get to cruise for like 30 seconds, which is fun considering the environment looks good. The game though doesn't lay out maps for you and doesn't give you any help. The director almost wants to make this thing as hard as possible because he never edits the movies(like normal directors and stunt coordinators do) and he never attempts to tell you where to go beforehand.

Other times, your guy won't go prone because he is too busy getting shot up to move.Audio is awful.  The music is not on key at all and holds notes until you reach your next destination.  I had to turn it off.  There's klaxon alarms that sound like they came from a microwave that just drill into your skull.  They added a growl to the goliath model to make it more mean but its too obvious.

It does offer a wide range of exercises that incorporate the Balance Board and it really can make you work up a sweat. The big problem is that it constantly chastises you for not moving quickly enough to keep up with it, and the BMI charts it's using call everyone obese. I tried it myself (I'm 6'0"", 185 lbs) and it started harping on me about my weight. Maybe Nintendo meant for this to be motivating, but I find it becomes annoying very quickly.

You play as Snake, a commando who must navigate his way through enemy territory to thwart the communist plans to develop a new ICBM launcher.The first bad thing you'll notice as you play this is the cut scenes.  During the first three hours of the game, you'll only play for about 1/2 hour.  The other two and a half hours you'll be sitting there watching it.  The cut-scenes unfortunately are pretty awful.  Snake talks in a monotone throughout the whole thing, making it almost comical in it's badness.  So much of the stuff is just incredibly boring to sit through.  It would be really boring as a movie, it's even more boring when you were expecting a game you could actually play instead of sitting and watching.  By the halfway point of the game, the cut-scenes decrease in volume and actually become pretty good, but by then it's just too late.  You're so sick of watching the game that even good cut-scenes can't save it.The other gigantic problem is the camera system.  You get a third person view which only extends for a short distance around your character.  Enemies will almost always attack from beyond that distance, so you'll have bullets flying at you and you can't see where they're coming from.  So you switch to first person view - the problem being that you can't move while in this view - you can only stand still and turn.  If you've got someone shooting at you, it means that all the other bad guys in the area have been alerted so there will immediately be four or five guys after you.  Trying to fight five guys with the awful camera system is an exercise in frustration.  You stand in place, aiming your gun.  Just as you get one guy in your sights, another guy (who has run right up to you while you were aiming your gun, but you couldn't see him) will knock you down.  You get up and try to aim again, and just as you've got the enemy in your sights, you get knocked down again.  This is the routine throughout the entire game.Overall, this game is completely ruined by the awful camera system and the ludicrous amounts of really bad cut-scenes at the beginning.  I hear that Metal Gear Solid 3:  Subsistence is the same game except with an improved camera system and online play - I would definitely urge people to give that one a try instead.  It speaks volumes that the manufacturer would go through all the trouble and expense to release the identical game with a new camera system.  They wouldn't do that if the original camera system didn't suck so incredibly bad.  I could almost sit through the cut-scenes if there were some good game play to look forward to, but this game leaves you with nothing but frustration.",2,"So much potential, but ruined by an awful camera system",1179360000,"05 17, 2007"

A good part of the excitement on the show is the different personalities and Howie's comments to the people and all the silliness.  The voice of Howie Mandel is real in the game, but there's no way to have the interaction and the give and take that you have on the show.  That said, if you were playing the game with other people in the room watching in 1 player mode, or playing one of the custom games with up to 5 players, the conversation on your end might supply the party atmosphere that you see on the show.Everything is otherwise much like it is on the show, with the audience, the banker, etc. and you can play with your Mii which I thought was kind of a nice touch.  The one thing I was not impressed with is the graphics.  Howie looks similar to the real Howie, but there are lots of ragged edges to the graphics.  They should be smooth.  I'm playing on a big screen TV and using component cables, but the graphics were rough enough that I went back to check my settings to make sure that I had it set to 480p instead of 480i.  For me, graphics in a Wii game don't have to be fancy, but the ragged edges are distracting.  Maybe on a smaller screen it would be less noticeable.  I posted some photos under the customer images, but it's kind of hard to see since they reduce the size here, but have a look anyway.There are several options in the custom games that can be played with up to 5 players.  There's a Special Event where you can have from 2 to 13 $1,000,0000 cases.  There are also challenges in the 1 player mode like the Variety Ladder where your play one game of each special event type and try to win as much as you can, or Risky Business where you have to win increasingly larger amounts to keep playing.  In the Banker's Challenge you play 3 games in a row against computer opponents where the first game is against one, the second against 2 and the third against 3.  Again, you try to win as much as possible.There are some mini games included such as Sharpshooter where you shoot the cases, Blackjack which plays like the card game but instead of 21 you're playing to $2,100 and instead of cards, you're dealt cases.  There's also a Marathon that has you playing each mini-game in random order, trying to score as much cash as you can.  It's probably good that they have the mini-games since playing Deal or No Deal would get boring after a while.All in all, I think for the price it's a reasonably good game except I wish the graphics were more smoothly rendered.  I think it would be a good game at a party, even with only one player at a time because the interaction would make it more like the TV show.

The story moved with narration from another character and talked about you and your deeds.  That narration helped moved the story along.  The action was also a big plus so it was a fun game to like.So I didn't hesitate to buy Resistance 2 and I've got to say I'm disappointed.  I'm not disappointed by the multi-player aspects but that wasn't why I bought the game.  It was story and level design that is off.  Without getting into the story, it's that there isn't much of one. The character is simply thrown in the middle of battle after battle.  There are no major cut-scenes with story telling in the middle.  It's just a jump from A to B with a little bit of splash narration.  Then there are the levels which aren't that exciting.  And it's not that that this isn't a pretty game.  Because it's very pretty.  But that it's very linear.  You get to explore a town that has  been overrun by the Chimera.  But you can't open houses.  Only certain ones.  So you never feel like you're exploring to find the enemy.  You're just funnelled into a series of encounters again and again and again.  So you'll find yourself watching for a new gun and then have to duke it out with some enemies that just pop up again and again.More story, bigger levels that weren't so linear and this would be awesome.

Not to much is new with this game but considering Asylum and City were my favorite games on this generation of consoles this is one of the times I would say thats not a bad thing. The one thing new that separates it from city however is Multiplier which if you can manage to start a game (doesn't seem to be many playing online yet) it can add some extra fun to it expecilly taking down thugs with batman and robin and it appears like there may be more modes in the future. However I feel its more of a bonus if your getting this game for the multiplayer you may be dissapointed. Also The have improved crime scenes in the game but its more for show your still basically holding X for scaning it kinda feels like batman is cheating on his detective skills.

As for the voices I think the did a great job with sure it doesn't have Kevin Conroy or Mark Hammill but the new actors fit this game more since its about the early days of batman when the were much younger. The one thing I am dissapointed with in this game however is the Easter Eggs theres rarely ever if any random tie ins anywhere which the previous developer was amazing for so there isn't quite as much detail and of coarse the city is all criminals with few random citizens on the street.

This game is wrapped with STEAM so STEAM is a legitimate issue, even if it is the only issue.Now .. . . I've read virtually all the reviews of this product and have some things I want to say:1) STEAM is not a product protection service, and does not discourage piracy. As most of you know, anyone can download a pirated copy of any popular game in a matter of days.2) STEAM serves no purpose other than being a marketing platform for products. Sure, ya don't have to care for a DVD if ya download a game and ya have to keep your key . . . big deal. And ya, it may be convenient to find your friends to play an online game with, and various other small time benefits to make users feel they are getting something great by having STEAM on their computer . . . but . . .3) WindowsBlowUp is hard enough to keep working properly without some resource hog that can't be controlled starting up, as if WindowsBlowsUp doesn't have enough unnecessary processes already.4) STEAM is a horrible security risk. To see a discussion of this go to [&#8230;]. BTW, I would not be surprised in the least if STEAM had already been compromised. Buy a good book on computer forensics. The stories of companies getting hacked, getting their files stolen, paying a ransom, and NOT reporting it to stockholders let alone the public is stunning.5) Programmers are notorious for leaving backdoors in programs. If ya don't know what a backdoor is, or are skeptical go to this link -[&#8230;], and you will see how vulnerable computer users are.6) STEAM server is secure? Think again. It takes one skilled system wise programmer working in the STEAM server installation to download all the customer information onto a portable device and sell it to the highest bidder.7) Some reviews and comment talk about the ""ethical"" and ""moral"" character and responsibility of corporations. Hogwash! Enron had an corporate ""ethics"" policy too! Remember Enron? If not look it up. I worked for years in business and there is only a couple rules companies (most of them) follow. Executives focus on personal advancement above all else, and the corporation will do whatever it takes to ensure its continued existence, and growth and will exterminate any threat if possible using whatever means it thinks it can get away with. Profit IS everything!8) Anyone who thinks that STEAM is concerned about individual user satisfaction is delusional. STEAM is concerned only by numbers and statistics. Really . . . if STEAM was concerned about user experience, there would be a check box which gave the consumer the ability to completely disable STEAM until the time the consumer wanted to connect to get the patches or look at products available.9) I predict that when STEAM (if and/or when they do) gets a market share that is great enough to monopolize the gaming market, they will increase the price of the product, charge for the service, etc.10) I use as an example MicrosoftBlowsUp as an example. As an operating system it sucks donkey balls and is way over priced. Ubuntu is way better and free too. Any program you want is available for FREE. Every driver you could ever want is included as a loadable module so ya don't have to install drivers for your printer, or any other peripheral you use. Never defrag, no corrupt registry or files, secure, and fast. MicrosoftBlowsUp has used every trick it can to maximize its profits and extinguish any competition to the detriment of the consumer. STEAM will do exactly the same thing IF it gains enough market share. That's why I dumped my PC's and just spent $4000 buying two MacBook Pro's.11) I've had multiple STEAM accounts ""restricted"" for who know what reason, have had download times that were in the 12 - 20 hour range for game data, STEAM not available so I can't play my game, and others report corrupt files, game patches being installed that make game saves obsolete, support only through e-mails and very slow too. Go to the STEAM forums to find all the complains of service, or days of non-service. Lets not forget the pop-up ads. For those with bandwidth limitations this uncontrollable service can be a killer and can put the user over their limit with sometimes extremely costly over-usage charges.12) Let me list just some of the problems STEAM causes the consumer (all these comments come from 1 star reviews):""I have a rather stingy 450MB daily download limit so it REALLY pisses me off that a friggin' video game publisher would presume to waste my bandwidth with an always on connection and download updates uncontrollably.""""At present, I have been waiting for two hours for Civ V to load, for it's been trying to install an update for that period.""""[STEAM] . .. is intrusive and a waste of system resources.""""I've written repeated e-mails to Steam support and 2K Games and get the automated response that I will be contacted within 72 hours.

It's okay, actually, for download-only games... I don't mind it. I also don't mind the activation scheme. What I do mind is how much it degrades the initial and very important installation experience, and how you have to run steam to run the game -- I hate that! You screw up the install process and you put the user in a really bad mood right away -- not good.It took me thirty minutes of watching steam say ""Checking file 1 of 1"" and two restarts of the installation to figure out that it was, in the background, downloading a 4.6GB update for Civ IV, along with 2 other updates totalling 2.0GB!!!! AND IT NEVER EVEN TOLD ME! So, I paused all the downloads and clicked the ""Play Now"" button next to Civ V, got a loading screen, then a dialog box that really p*ss*d me off: It said ""Updating"" with a greyed out ""Play Now"" button.""",1,STEAM rant . . . .,1289001600,"11 6, 2010"

But, just like EA wants me to do, I buy it just about every year...For me though, I think I've got my money's worth out of FIFA 10. It's always fun to play/ waste time with when I should be doing something more productive with my life. The action is pretty much non-stop once the game gets started, so soccer has always been awesome on the consoles. For me, the fast pace is a great reason why I buy a soccer game every year - no timeouts, no call-the-next-play, no pitch-selection, no free-throws, etc.Things I like about FIFA 10:The Create-a-player is very good. I like that you can gather experience/level up's in different areas of the game. So if you're playing in the practice arena, you can get points there. If you're playing with your created-player in the Manager Mode, you can get points there.Gameplay is good. Actually when I started, it was a little frustrating in that it's definitely harder than in previous years to score goals. It does take practice. Even dropping the difficulty down a level, it was still quasi-difficult to score when the teams are evenly matched.I've played a few (not a lot) online games. My experience there has been pretty good/ pretty stable. Sometimes I will get a game that is really lagging/ slow. I suspect that it's either my internet connection or my opponent's though. I've found that it's either a nail-biting close match or I get completely destroyed.Graphics are great. Animations are good. The number of real-life stadiums is pretty good too. And I know it's lame to say, but I actually like the soundtrack.Things I don't like:Skill moves - as another reviewer mentioned, the skill moves are difficult to use in most matches, so I don't really use them a lot.OFF THE POST! - as other reviewers have mentioned too, an absurdly annoying amount of shots end up hitting the post. That issue drives me crazy.Manager Mode - This is where I've spent hours of my time. Overall I'm just not really loving this piece as much as I would like to. I want it to be something epic, but it's just blah. It's not significantly better than last year's. The transfers are easy to understand though. I've taken to now just searching for Any status (instead of For Sale only) and buying players from lesser divisions for cheaper fees/much cheaper weekly wages.EA, I would love it if you could do something where you create your own club in the bottom-most division of England/Germany/Spain/Italy/etc. You would create your own Team Name, City, Colors, Jersey Pattern(s), Alternate Jerseys, Sponsors (and how that would look on the jersey), Customize your Stadium, Name your Stadium. Then you would start your journey with some random players and a budget. Then over the process of 10-20 seasons, you try to work that club up to the Premiership/Bundesliga/La Liga/etc, and into the Champions League, etc. Now, that is what Manager Mode is missing in my opinion.Overall though, FIFA 10's a great game especially if you don't have last year's already. I feel like I get my money's worth out of it, so that is why I keep coming back year after year. I'm generally happy with the game.",4,FIFA 10 PS3,1266883200,"02 23, 2010"
5597,212480,A334SLFQ5WGVAM,B009K6YJTS,"Samuel Mitchell ""Sam I Am""","[39, 44]","I was really excited for this game, especially after watching a few of the videos that I will post in the comment section (Amazon doesn't allow linking to other sites in their reviews). I went so far as to pre-order the game on Steam and now wish I could get a refund.The ONLY good thing about this game is that the whole thing can be beaten in under 5 hours (less if not for the bugs). According to Steam, I played this game for 7 hours so far and have had 4 crashes, as well as encountering literally countless bugs, the best of which was doors NOT OPENING, or getting STUCK in the environment - forcing me to reload multiple times... Yeah. No idea how this made it past quality assurance... Way to go Gearbox, way to go.But honestly, the bugs aren't even the worst part. What makes this game so terribly boring is that it feels like an on rails light gun game, with terrible and uninteresting level design (there are some exceptions to this). Why an Aliens game has such limiting environments is beyond my understanding. Invisible walls and missing textures also serve to bring down the little immersion that some of the better designed areas bring to the table.The enemy AI is absolute garbage and allows you to easily blast one Xeno after another as they calmly walk in front of your shotgun (or get glitched in the environment and just stand there). Getting hit in ACM by an alien is virtually impossible.Eventually you also get to fight some humans, but nothing changes. You can still Rambo your way through everything using your trusty shotgun with what feels like unlimited ammunition and pinpoint precision.Next up is the AI of your squad mates, and wow... It is not uncommon to see someone glitched in the environment or running around in circles during a firefight. You simply can't make stuff like this up!All in all this game has the absolutely worst AI I have seen in recent releases, which is even more disappointing seeing as how Gearbox promised us ""incredibly advanced AI"".Gameplay doesn't fare any better. At one point you are forced into a stealth level and a few Work Loader sequences. That's it. And they are all as bad as the rest of the game. There is NOTHING new or even marginally exciting in Aliens: Colonial Marines. In fact, it makes the disaster that was Duke Nukem Forever seem like a masterpiece. I also don't understand what happened to ACM's graphics and animations. A few of the older demo videos of ""actual gameplay"" that Gearbox was showing off look much better than the retail game does on my (almost) top of the line gaming machine. Even on the highest settings this game looks like Doom 3, which looked good when it came out years ago - but has not aged too well in the graphic department. For some reason ACM also animates much worse than D3 - the animations seem stiff and forced.Even if I could forgive all of the above, the story is terrible (even more so considering that this is supposed to be the sequel to the films), complete with COUNTLESS plot holes, and ""WTH"" moments. Without giving anything away, dead characters are brought back to life with no explanation, and areas that have been nuked are now back in perfectly serviceable conditions (once again with no explanation).I suggest that you stay away unless you can get the game for around $10, since in its current state that is all ACM is honestly worth.I am currently working with Steam to try and get my money back due to all the false advertising Gearbox did before the game released (links in the comments section).

At first you won't want to admit it (because you just dropped sixty bucks on a game with some history in the name) but eventually you'll accept it and will be able to admit that this game will be in the bargain bin in about 2 months.When POP Sands of Time came out for PS2 I was instantly hooked. I was so enthralled by that game. The maneuvering, the visuals, the imagination, etc. Fast forward several years and then Assassins Creed came out. POP SOT was the first game I thought of. AC was like SOT but oodles better. Then I heard a new POP game was coming out.I remember being leary about this title because of the cell shading. The ""cell-shaded"" graphics (as they're apparently called) is really just a cheap way to opt out of having to develop lifelike graphics. The character graphics look very last gen. The environment graphics don't look much better. It's like you're playing a comic book.But, I'm always willing to forgive lackluster visuals if the game has good gameplay. I am not exaggerating when I say that 98% of this game is nothing more than running around and exploring. No fighting, few puzzles, and no risk of dying or restarting at a checkpoint. It is literally impossible to die in this game. The gameplay is basically run, jump, climb, and then repeat. I don't understand what Ubi was thinking with this game. There is almost no point to this game. For every hour of gameplay, you might encounter one or two enemies. That's it. Seriously.My advice: fight the urge to buy this. Hit a few local rental stores and try it out first.

I almost gave up and ordered one off eBay from China, until one popped up at a good price. Looking back, I may have been better off ordering the knock-off from China as it seemed to have better contours.This one's made by Cyber Gadget, and their other grips are wonderful. At least their later ones. I own one for my 3DS XL and it's my favorite grip out of them all; it's almost as good as the most comfortable controller. The PSP and 3DS XL grips are made from the same rubber-like material.What makes a good grip for me is having a fat eggplant shape so your palms can extend out the back of the handheld, and legs/arms/handles that stretch downward, this way your hands feel like they're holding a controller rather than having them scrunched closely to the sides of the handheld, like you weren't holding a grip at all.This grip has excellent construction, no doubt, like any other Cyber Gadget grip, but it's missing one crucial feature mentioned above: the eggplant shape. This means that, while there are arms hanging downward, my hands come into a rather awkward and unpleasant position. I've had to train myself to hold the grip as if I were holding the PSP by itself, with my palms resting on the arms, except now I've got nothing for my fingertips to hang on to. So they curl back in toward the PSP. That would be the end of it, except the right handle, as you can see in the picture, has a cut out to make way for the power slide, but it didn't need that much chunk taken out. So what that means is that my right hand is a lot more uncomfortable than my left.It sounds weird describing it, but that's how it is. It's still better than using the PSP by itself, and the mechanism for tightening and loosening the PSP is fantastic (there's a little knob on the bottom that unscrews to let you slide down the bottom and insert the PSP), and the back opens and snaps just fine to remove and insert UMDs. It's just not as comfortable as other grips.I'm hotly debating if I should order a knock-off grip with the same design as my 3DS XL grip.",2,Okay at best.

I have played a few hours into it, but I doubt that my opinion will change much from now until I complete it.The game controls well, looks great, and actually provides a challenge (which is everyone's most surprising aspect).  Enemies can take you out in just a couple hits if you don't watch yourself, so the dodge function is an ABSOLUTE must.  Your size and power grows as you obtain relics throughout the stages, and this also serves as your health.  The bigger knack gets, the larger his health bar becomes.  Although that doesn't really seem to matter much since when you get bigger, so do the enemies.  Then those larger foes are able to once again take you down in one to two hits.Like I said, I doubt that this game will change the world.

I agree it makes no sense. Having a god-child come out of no-where and tell you 'we destroy you to save you', yeah that doesn't make sense now does it. I understand that there has been a lot of arguing about gamer 'entitlement' and how Mass Effect fans had their hopes up about how their choices would matter in the final battle. Well they didn't get that and now their pissed. Can you blame them, because I don't. And for the record THERE IS NO ENTITLEMENT. What Mass Effect fans had was trust, and a lot of it. We trusted Bioware to give us a game that would wrap up the entire franchise they way our choices culminated. That didn't happen, instead we got three color coated endings with a Deus Ex reference and an Adam and Eve allusion. However, Bioware stated many times that there would sixteen different endings and that your decisions would matter over the course of these games. But that was a lie, and lying costs costumer loyalty for future titles. Even the BBB (Better Business Bureau) said that Bioware did indeed falsely advertise Mass Effect 3. So, does this make Mass Effect fans whiny entitled brats that they didn't get what they want. No, Mass Effect fans have every right to voice their outcry against Bioware for lying to them, and calling the ending their 'artistic vision'. If the ending was just some simple happily-ever-after ending; I'm sure the Mass Effect series would still be remembered for years to come.This is how the endings should have played out.-Happily-ever-after(Shepard with Love-interest)-Bittersweet(Shepard sacrifices himself/herself)-Bad Ending(Reapers continue their harvest of galactic civilizations)With that terrible ending though. Mass Effect 3 is still a great game with an okay MP. However, I did not buy Mass Effect 3 for the game-play or the MP. I bought Mass Effect 3 for its compelling narrative.

Half the people you come up against will automatically drop and shoot and it gets really old.  I don't know why it's so prevalent in Black Ops 2, because it was only a minor problem in the first Black Ops and even less of a problem in the other CODs.  This needs fixed, and it needs fixed YESTERDAY.I really, really want to like this game.  The Pick 10 is brilliant and a ton of fun to tinker with.  The weapons are fun to use, have a lot of ""pop"", and the graphics overall are fantastic.  But this dropshotting nonsense has got to stop immediately.-- Update 11/15/2012 --After giving this game a lot more time, I've come to the conclusion that Black Ops 2 suffers from many of the same problems that Modern Warfare 2 did.  Let me explain:Modern Warfare 2 put an overemphasis on killstreaks and they also sped up the gameplay.  This was a substantial departure from COD4, against which I measure all CODs.For these two reasons, MW2 was one of my least favorite CODs.  Along came Black Ops, which slowed the game back down.  Call of Duty was strategic again, instead of a killstreak/explosion/camping fest.  It was great.Treyarch obviously did not understand why Black Ops was such a hit, because the things that separated it from MW2 now return:  grenade spam, rocket spam, blah blah blah.  Constant scorestreaks in the air and on the ground.  Objective-based games are absolute cluster****s.  Allowing points from scorestreaks to contribute to the next scorestreak was an utter failure.The game isn't strategic; it's just about who can direct the most explosions and scorestreaks at the objectives.It just isn't fun, which is a crying shame because the game is gorgeous to look at, and Treyarch has always done a phenomenal job with sound.Anyway, back to Black Ops for me!",2,"So close, but dropshotting and meatgrinder maps ruin MP",1352851200,"11 14, 2012"

For the most part the creators of this game have done a wonderful job.  The Kinect does a great job of tracking my movements accurately.  I wish my living room had a bit more space, but that's not the fault of the game.  There's a huge variety of workouts with difficulty levels from beginner to advanced and the majority of the routines I've tried were quite a bit of fun.There are a couple things that kept me from giving this game five stars though.  First, I have yet to be able to find a place in the game to see how long I've worked out in a particular session.  My goal is work out 30 minutes per day yet it appears the only way to track this is to note how long each routine lasts and add them up.  Usually I'm way off in my estimate though.  30 minutes on my clock at home doesn't mean I've worked out for 30 minutes in the game since you need to go back to the menu so often - more on that in a second.  It would be much easier if the game had a running total for time and calories burned in each session.My second complaint is that you can't really string together routines for a complete workout.  For instance I'd love to be able to choose a warm up, ab routine, cardio, and boot camp and then have the game string them together to form one whole workout - maybe with a 30-60 second break in between each.  As it is you need to select a single routine in the menu.  Once that's finished you go back to the main menu and search for the next routine.  By the time I've done this my heart rate has dropped and I feel like I'm just doing short bursts of exercise rather than a real workout.Having said that I really do think Ubisoft has done a great job and can't wait to see what they come up with for the next version.",4,Pretty Good Fitness Game,1358294400,"01 16, 2013"

The controls are sluggish and just like any other shooting game that doesn't have a gun peripherial, it gets boring FAST.

5554,138806,A1V3U1IQ5F89LD,B002I0J4AM,Thomas Vaughan,"[9, 13]","This game illustrates a lot that is broken with today's next-generation games.This game does have its good points.  It was put together with a lot of technical skill: the graphics, models, and animations are excellent.  The music is fantastically good.  The user interface was pretty smooth--you can tell this company has built many of these games before.  The game was a reasonable length, and all the levels were pretty detailed.  As far as I could tell, the Japanese voice actors did a great job.However, the story was terrible.  In fact, there really wasn't much of a story at all.  The dialogue was so bad it hurt.  The English dubbing was horrible.  The game is just a long grind and there is nothing at the end that makes it worthwhile.  Sure, some of the mechanics along the way are fun, but there was no story to pull you in.  As others have noted, the combat targeting system was useless.  In fact, at least one boss battle took advantage of the poor targeting system to make the battle even more of a challenge.  At times there were no save points for long stretches.  I left my PS3 on for a long weekend just because this game left me with no way to save progress and I had other things to do.[Yes, I finished it.  I knew I was going to write a low-star review, and I didn't think that would be fair without finishing it.  It took me several weeks to get through the last few levels because I really didn't want to play it.]Having finished it, I am pretty certain that this game was created by a directive: ""make a bunch of different levels and then see if you can stitch them together somehow.""  They obviously had a target demographic in mind (I think it was 14 year olds, with a reading level of 12 years old maybe?  No offense to any 12 or 14 year olds out there--you deserved better) but some of the subject matter seemed jarringly inappropriate for anyone that age, and there wasn't anything that would appeal to older audiences.The lack of quality writing was evident at every point.  There was no plot.  The characters were caricatures that never changed.  I mentioned the dialogue was bad, but that is understating it.  It reminded me of awkward middle-school fiction assignments.  At times it was like a bad horror movie, with important plot turns being defined by people doing the absolute dumbest thing they could do.  And the English dubbing was laughable.  I tried the game in English at first, but it was terrible (people just reading lines in near-monotone, not acting) so I turned it off.  I tried turning the English dubbing back on a few times, but it didn't seem to get better.  The writing was terrible, but at least the Japanese voice actors did a good job with what they were given.All of this meant that the cut scenes, while beautifully rendered and animated, were painful to watch.  The cut scenes usually had little relevance or purpose other than to mechanically advance to the next level of the game, characters had emotional reactions that were totally unbelievable and usually aggravating, and again, there was no story to speak of.  What meagre story there was seemed to center on powerful beings who preferred oblivion to existence.  After several dozen excruciating cut scenes I started to see their point.So what did I (and other reviewers) do?  We skipped the cut scenes.  Which meant the company spent millions of dollars, and thousands of hours, on cut scenes that were never watched because the writing was so bad.  When the final credits rolled by I felt sorry for the many people that spent so much of their time and effort just to see their work wasted.I think a lot of today's games are like this: a high level of technical execution in most areas, completely undercut by a lack of writing.  Other than flashy graphics, there wasn't much point to playing this.Like many others, I bought this for something to do before Final Fantasy XIII came out.  Having spent a lot of money on this, I don't think I'll go anywhere near FFXIII, since it looks like more of the same.",2,Not worth it--play a good PS2 game instead,1273190400,"05 7, 2010"

After playing it with my daughter and husband, we really cannot understand why people like this game.It opens with a REALLY long, slow, boring monolog from the King (written, not spoke) that goes on forever and then some.  When you finally get past that, there is another really long boring monolog before you can do the training session. Yawn. The training mode has you roll around gathering up larger & larger items, and demonstrates the game. After wandering aimlessly for a LONG time around a non-intutive, unlabeled picture screen, you eventually luck upon the one icon that starts the ""game"".The 1-person mode is kind of cute for about 10 or maybe 15 minutes.  Roll around gathering small items and then gradually larger items. There is a strict time limit that stops you from getting your ""garbage ball"" too big. This short time limit was really annoying. Then, there is more slow, boring, can't skip dialog and pictures while you score, and another delay before you can play again. Throughout, the music is Chinese and has Chinese singing -- my daughter thought this the best aspect of the game. The graphics are primitive (see the game's cover picture for a good example).The 2-person mode is really stupid. Two people try to push the same ball.  Neither one has a sense that they are really in control; and it ends up being pretty frustrating and dull even with adults who work well together. Our conclusion after trying the 2-person mode was that it was entirely worthless!If you want an excellent 2-person Playstation 2 game, tryThe Adventures of Cookie & Creaminstead.",1,boring dialog with a very poor 2-person mode,1294185600,"01 5, 2011"

My main complaint is the graphics -- they are still using MW 1 and MW 2 quality graphics. Compared to GoW 3, Battlefield 3, Rage, etc., etc., (and even older games like Crysis 2), MW3 sucks by comparison. Not even close. It's like the difference between an HD football game and a 360p football game -- it's really, really noticeable. I should note that the single player graphics are better than the multiplayer textures, however, which is the opposite of Battlefield 3.They did add in some new game modes and stuff that are nice, and the single player campaign is still quite fun (even with the sub-par graphics), but I can't believe this game is projected to sell 17 million copies in the first week. This game will do well, but eventually their momentum will slow with this kind of sub-par performance. It's like they aren't even trying because they don't have to. Think: IBM in the 80s. It can, and will fizzle unless they get their act together -- Activision's Call of Duty is NOT too big to fail.Multiplayer is different from Battlefield 3, which emphasizes massive, well, battlefields, with lots of heavy tanks stuff. Fairly different gaming experience. The two are not directly comparable. But if you like the up and close combat of Modern Warfare I think Gears of War 3 is vastly superior.Bottom line: spend your money on Battlefield 3 or Gears of War 3 -- game franchises that are still innovating. They offer a somewhat different experience, but it is a much better experience. I would buy this for $30, but not $60. By the time you add in DLC like map packs and stuff, much less the Elite service, they are asking $100+ for it. A remarkable act of hubris, and as another reviewer said, rather insulting. If the price was more reasonable I would rate the game higher.I'd say more about this game, but I don't seriously expect many to read all the way to my review.

It seems like maybe just a little oversight in the production of the game, but my issues...* You can't use your Miis.  I love creating Miis.  Jeopardy allows you to use them, and still has the system of rewarding you for different things in the game with new outfits and stuff like that.  There are only I believe 16 characters that you can choose from in this game.  Not a huge deal, but It would be a little more fun with the Miis.* There's no host.  The gameplay is advanced by a kind of weird voice over.  I think this game might have been developed after John O'Hurley left the show, but before Steve Harvey took over.  Either that, or they just opted to not include either one of them...  either way, why not just have someone?  It makes the game more like the TV show.* The AI on the computer is pretty bad.  For the first five or so rounds, they are just as dumb as a bag of rocks.  They will provide answers that are sort of related to the survey, but definitely not answers that anyone would actually give.  If they win a faceoff, they just pass the play to you at the beginning (which is actually OK - who wants to watch the computer play the video game you just bought? Even still though - not really like the show...).  Sometimes, they will repeat an answer that you already gave.  That happened 3 times in a row - with them repeating the most recent answer we gave on their opportunity to steal the survey.  Then - after 5 games, the computer just all of a sudden gets pretty good and competitive.  There's no gradation to it - it's just bad stupid computer opponents in one round, and the next round, they're quick and generally answering correctly.  They get a lot of the more obscure answers.* Kind of glitchy in the responses.  I guess it's kind of like that on the actual show too.  The survey was ""Something real or imaginary that kids are afraid of."" I responded ""Witches.""  It flipped over ""The dark"".  On other ones, and I'm struggling to remember exactly what they were, but I responded very close to what the actual board said, and was denied.  Like I said - even the show does that sometimes, so I guess it's OK - it just seems to do it a little more frequently than the show would.* Only allows 2 controllers.  Ok - this isn't a huge deal, but on the show, it's a 10 person game.  It's not very difficult to pass the controller around if you're playing with more than 2 people, but it would be even easier if it just allowed up to 4 controllers.* You have to point and type.  In the Jeopardy game, you can use the directional pad to navigate through the keyboard, but in Family Feud, you have to point.  More than once, I typed in something I didn't mean to and was stuck with submitting the wrong answer.* Too many surveys that say ""At what age would xxxxx?""  These ones are pretty stupid.  It basically just gives you a range of numbers randomly arranged as answers, with a few outliers to keep it a spicy...  I don't know.  They're not as fun as actually guessing the other kinds of surveys, because you know that all of the answers are going to just be numbers in a short range.  One of them asked ""The age that you first fell in love."" One asked ""The age that a kid might go to get braces.""  They're not as challenging as the other surveys.That said - the game is pretty fun. The gameplay is just like it would be on the show.  It goes by pretty quick, so you can do 2 or 3 rounds in a half hour, which is about my limit on video games these days.

The setup is extremely simple and works great. There are some issues, on some games there is audio dip or phase out but mostly it is the games fault for making the game for a 6.1 system and not a 5.1 system, an example is the Call of Duty games where in Call of Duty 2 it happens more often that in Call of Duty 4.

PCF even released Duty Calls, a 1-level parody game mocking the conventions of Call of Duty- a pointless experience system, needless game mechanics, and an overwrought REAL WORLD PLOT.Sadly, Bulletstorm itself jumps into modern gaming conventions with both feet. While touted as ""not another cover-based shooter"" it is TOTALLY a cover based shooter- get shot a few times and the game will warn you (invasively) to seek cover. Why? So your auto-regenerating health can kick in OF COURSE. There's no cover button, but when the game makes you use cover anyway, that kind of makes things worse. Levels are painfully linear yet still rife with invisible walls, a condition made more apparent by the fact that you cannot jump. Space becomes a movement action button, causing you to dash, and, when EXACTLY in the right place, vault over scripted obstacles. But good luck REACHING the sweet spot when scenery and your NPC helper's collision boxes make rapid navigation of the environment a huge hassle. And are there totally automatic cutscenes where you must pointlessly press buttons to progress? YES THERE ARE. A lot of them. There's also a totally unwanted experience system that serves to break up the action.For an ostensibly humorous game, Bulletstorm also kind of fails. It may be meant to be comedic, but the story and characters come across more as serious in a late 90s kind of way- perhaps funny in a metatextual sense, but not very. Comparisons to Daikatana are not inappropriate, although your helpers in Bulletstorm require mercifully less babysitting.In Bulletstorm's defense, it is a lovely game. Animations are very well achieved, the music is good, and lighting is great; and since it's Unreal technology the requirements are quite acceptable. And the combat controls always do what you want them to, although the leash, the kick, and their associated bullet time are all mechanics we've seen before. I actually found myself preferring to not use the leash because it jars the camera around and suspends your aiming, but the game forces it upon you for a number of puzzles.PROS:-Looks sexy-Good combat controls-Music and other audio are decentCONS:-Embraces nearly every worthless convention of the modern shooters it claims to be an antithesis to-Awkward motion made more so by tight, restrictive levels-Vague, generic plot could belong to any shooter made in the Voodoo generationFINAL THOUGHTS:-Buy Painkiller instead",2,Falls into its own traps,1343865600,"08 2, 2012"

Overall, I just don't enjoy playing the game.  It doesn't feel right to me, after having played Madden since 91 on the Sega Genesis.  I bought and enjoyed Madden every year from 91 through 2007 for PS2.  I tested out a few next gen versions and I hated them so much that I have never bought them new.  I bought Madden 10 used for a few bucks and didn't like it.  This is the first time I have paid the full amount to buy a next gen Madden brand new, and I am not happy with it.  This game would have been a great start for the first version of Madden for the PS3 back in 06 or 07.  But this is unacceptable for the 7th or 8th version of Madden for the PS3.  It is an unfinished raw product.  The new infinity engine has promise, but it is very raw.  It needs a few years of refining.  The players move faster than in real life in my opinion.  It does not look realistic during gameplay.  However, I will admit that the framerate is better and they move a lot more fluid than in the previous versions.  The physics engine is a step in the right direction, but it needs work to refine it, fix the bugs, and make it more realistic.  I do not like the game interface; it is confusing and difficult to navigate.  I do not like the fact that you cannot customize controls.  I am used to using the X button to sprint, and in past versions you could change from the right trigger.  I also like using the D-pad to move my players, not the analog stick.  This year you have to use the analog stick.  I don't like how you have to wait to pull up instant replay until a few seconds after the play is over.  It used to be instantaneous.  You also used to be able to access instant replay by pressing R1 and R2 at the same time; you can't do that anymore.  You used to be able to call a hot route by pressing the triangle; not in this version.  The controls are more responsive than previous next-gen versions, but still not as responsive and crisp as the PS2 versions of the game.  The blocking doesn't seem realistic to me; either there are giant holes to run through or I get stuffed in the backfield regardless of what I do.  In previous versions I could navigate through blocking and use stiff arms, spin moves, and jukes.  The QB pocket doesn't feel normal.  Either I can stay back there all day regardless of where I stand, or I get sacked no matter what.  Maybe by Madden 15 they will have a decent, finished, tested product to sell for the PS3, and by that time the PS4 will be out.  In my opinion, if they would just take Madden 07 for the PS2, leave the interface, gameplay, and controls exactly the same, add high definition graphics and update the rosters, I would be happy.  I am going to go back to playing franchise mode on Madden 07 for the PS2 and sell Madden 13.",2,Should Have Been Released in 2007,1348444800,"09 24, 2012"

Back in the 90s I only ever played Sonic and Sonic 2 on my Mega Drive. I remember when Sonic 3 came out in about June 1994. It was out of my price range at the time and by the time I had enough money to invest the Mega Drive was already losing ground to the next-generation consoles so I never bothered.Now that I'm trying to catch up with all the games I missed I am a little bit disappointed with Sonic 3. The first sequel was released to unprecedented hype in the run up to Xmas in 1992, while Sonic 3 seemed to just appear in shops with little to no fanfare.The gameplay is nearly no different from the previous games. Sonic jumps, dashes, spins, accelerates and smashes as usual. The special stages have been changed again. The rotating labyrinths and speedway chases are gone and in their place there is the cruelest, hardest level I've ever played in any video game. Sonic runs around on a giant sphere collecting blue spheres and avoiding red spheres, all in giddy, disorientating faux-3D. It's the kind of thing that provokes seizures. And unless you have the reflexes of a superhuman gunslinger and have a control pad with responses far beyond what the Mega Drive was capable of you'll never, ever manage to succeed at them all.The music is also a bit of step-down from Sonic 1 and 2. Those tunes were catchy and fun, while the tunes in this game are just kinda middling and mediocre. A bit of a missed opportunity.And don't get too excited about the ending. The game just...STOPS. There's no epic climax, no eye-candy, no credits recap. It just ends. I do realize that this is because the game is really only halfway finished but the developers still could have put in something...anything! A cliffhanger perhaps?Despite the disappointment, I'm still looking forward to Sonic & Knuckles. It's got a lot to make up for. Afterwards I'll revisit Sonic 3 with the lock-on and see if it makes for a better experience.Graphics ASound BGameplay BLasting Appeal B-",3,Somewhat truncated as a result of the split,1275177600,"05 30, 2010"

Here are my current observations.  i will begin by saying that I enjoy playing the game a lot.CONS:1.  Probably the most annoying thing is that the commentary will lag almost a whole play behind.2.  I miss the create a school option, not so much for being able to create m y school, but at least it gave me access to play the fight songs.3.  The sideline teammates, not only just stand there and clap, but their facemasks aren't even the correct color.  I play as Oklahoma, and on the field, the facemasks are white, but on the sideline, they are dark blue.4.  I wish they'd keep the stiff arm buttons as RB and LB.  It shouldn't be the A button.  I keep forgetting this and i fumble the ball as I tend to hit L trigger after LB does not work.  I'm teaching myself to hit A button though.5.  During bowl games, i wish they at least put each team's end zone design in there instead of some generic stuff.  EA sports has done it before, and they do it in the OU-Texas game, so it shouldn't be that difficult.6.  Even though they've tried, i wish the crew would work on even more new dialogue.PROS:1.  The animation, especially tackling and mid air collisions is way improved.2.  the players, for the most part move a heck a lot smoother.3.  i'm glad they have more stadiums in the game, THe fact that the Alamo Bowl, played in the AlamoDOME played outside was inexcusable.4.  OU-Texas and UF-UGA are played in their correct stadiums.  They finally included the Cotton Bowl.  Too bad they didn't get the official games designs like prior years.  (PS it's too bad it's supposedly no longer the world's largest outdoor cocktail party too.  God forbid if college students drink alcohol.)I'm still debating if i like the instant replay saving stuff yet.  I like how fast it comes up at the end of the game, but the viewing options are quite limited afterwards.  It is nice, however, to relive the time the guy dove for my endzone, and i whopped him in mid air, and he fumbled and I recovered to keep him out.  The game isn't as bad as some people on here would lead you to believe.1 August 2007After playing a little longer, I've discovered a couple of more things about the game that I would like to comment on.Turn down the clipping attribute to almost nothing.  I had about fifteen clipping calls, so I turned the slider waaaaaaay down, and it still called them, but not as often, but almost.Secondly, while I like that the stats come up at the bottom of the screen, EA no longer lets you know if they are career, current season, or just that game's stats.a nice suggestion would be to bring back the EA ticker either across the bottom of the screen or accessible in the pause menu mode like ps1 so you can see how those other teams are doing.  with the espn tie in, it'd be even cooler to run have your dynasty's and real life scores and info running across the bottom of the screen, or at minimum, do the on the :15s like they do on espn. I played this year's Big XII championship in the Alamodome, but it was an outdoor stadium.  Go figure.  I never did check this year's Alamo Bowl.",4,NCAA Football 08,1185580800,"07 28, 2007"

A game like Dance Central is an excellent use of Kinect's technology because it enables the player to learn some new things and get a workout while doing it. Rabbids, however, falls more on the gimmicky spectrum.In essence, this game is a party game. I'd liken it to a game like Twister: it can be good, lighthearted fun when you're playing with a group of people, but it has no real appeal when it's just one or two people engaging with the game. Rabbids has a wide variety of activities, and the kids enjoy it, but it's the kind of game that you play a couple of times and then quickly forget about.The mini games, while fun, aren't anything all that original.

When I did at length try it, I thought it was excellent. Within a year, I had all 3 of the North American releases of FF. Years after, I was saying ""There ought to be a remake of the original Final Fantasy to match the new technology."" That industry has proven so profitable and popular, a remake would be nothing short of excellent.In Final Fantasy Origins, I was not one bit disappointed. The score is beautifully reorchestrated (in some cases, it sounds entirely new). The graphics are first rate (inevitable from Square), the battle system improved, and the dialogue much cleaner. You no longer spend time wandering about, wondering what you should do next, or where you should go. It is all spelled out for you. The only downside was the change of the names of locations and characters - Square might have, at least, left us these little things that all FF players became familiar with over the years. But all the good things it has make up for this little defect.Then there's FF2. Having never seen it before, it does not look any better than the first game (that is, the remake of FF1). The conceits of the plot are acceptable, but the primary complaint is how hard the game is to play. There are no levels to gain, money is scarce, side quests are few (if at all), and the characters a little dull. This all got improved as the series progressed, so it's not at all bad.

1364,53620,A1MRERC88FV5VN,B0007QCNR0,"Steven C. Miller ""milladrive""","[3, 3]","Well, I've finished ""Still Life"" and I'm happy to report it was a real treat.First off, let me say that playing the first game in this series, ""Post Mortem,"" is not essential to enjoying ""Still Life,"" although it can help in getting some background to the goings-on.  The various minor quirks of ""Post Mortem"" may deter some players from continuing on the journey, but trust me when I say that the cons of ""Post Mortem"" barely exist in ""Still Life.""  And, while I do recommend playing ""Post Mortem"" prior to ""Still Life,"" it's not necessary to enjoy ""Still Life,"" a far superior experience.Of the many terrific features of ""Still Life"" is the graphics.  They are, without a doubt, some of the finest graphics ever made.  In fact, to compare the graphics to games like ""The Longest Journey""/Dreamfall"" or either ""Syberia"" adventures (two halves of one game) would be unfair, since, although the graphics of those games are stellar, ""Still Life"" supercedes them for ambience and sheer eye-candy.Then there are the game's controls.  Dreamcatcher and Microids, in my humble opinion, have reached the pinnacle of controllability with ""Still Life.""  Whether using the mouse or the keyboard, the icons are clear in their intentions, easy to understand, and never ambiguous.  Every adventure game should use the controls from ""Still Life"" as their prototype for all future games.Next on the list would have to be the attachment derived from the characters.  Not only has the acting and writing improved since ""Post Mortem,"" but now the McPherson family is three generations strong, what with playing both grandfather Gus and granddaughter Victoria (as well as son and father Pat being a part of the scheme).  I played ""Post Mortem,"" but I became more attached to Gus in this game, and becoming interspersed with Victoria came as naturally as breathing.  She's just super.The primary comparison that can be made to ""Post Mortem"" is the realism.  In ""Still Life,"" the writing and acting are quantum leaps ahead of its predecessor.  The language and graphical realism are no places for the kiddies, and just for that it gets my vote.  It wasn't pablumized for our adult consumption.And the bugs are far and few between.  Yes, there's some minor stuttering during the cut-scenes, but when compared to all-too-many other adventure/crime-mystery games, there's nothing to speak of.  I give a full five stars to the QA department for ensuring that this game made it to the market without buggy qualms.The only real drawback to the gameplay -- albeit a very minor one -- is that when one wishes to move to a different location on the map, one is required to literally travel back to the originating point of the present location in order to bring up the map on the screen.  Again, this isn't really a biggie, especially since at very least we get to re-view the splendid graphics on our way back to the entry point.Also on the plus side -- did I mention the graphics? -- are the sound effects, game durability (it's no four-hour farce), and challenge.  In fact, I found the challenge to be so middle-of-the-road that I think it's as close to perfect as can be.  Some games' puzzles befuddle logic and other games' puzzles are simply too simple.  In ""Still Life,"" however, I think the middle ground has been found.  Like I say, this game is not for the children, but for those of us adults who happen to enjoy NOT being weighed down by too many stumpers yet enjoy several mini-games, the challenge is just right.The game is quite linear, so if you enjoy games that insist you jump around the map to find clues and piece them together in order to make even slight progress, then this isn't for you.  But if you're like me and enjoy one-step-at-a-time adventure games, then I thoroughly recommend giving it a try.Also, one needn't suspend disbelief when playing ""Still Life"" (as one is required to do when playing the awesome ""LJ"" games).  ""Still Life"" is quite realistic, with no aliens, mutants, psychokinesis, nor scenes from the future.  Quite refreshing.Overall, when rating ""modern"" adventure games (as opposed to the ""Monkey Island"" series), I give ""Still Life"" a 19 on a scale of 1 to 20.  Only the two ""Longest Journey"" games come close to its engaging qualities.  And that says a lot.Highly recommended.",5,One of the best ever...,1169596800,"01 24, 2007"

After playing it though, I am very very disappointed.Where do I start?  Lets start where the rubber meets the road: the gameplay.  It's awful.  Controlling the ships is an exercise in frustration, and the battles are really lackluster.  They seemingly drag on forever at a very leisurely pace.  On the ground, things are even worse.  Again very counter-intuitive controls and slow boring battles.The other area that sorely disappoints me is the ""Star Trek""-iness of the game.  They really failed miserably to capture the whole ""what it would be like to be in that universe thing"".  I created an Engineer, but immediately the game had me treating people in the medical bay, conversing with aliens on the bridge, and a half hour into the game I was already piloting my own ship.  In other words, there was no sense at all that I was like ""Scotty"".  I simply had some ""bonuses"" to repair things *rolls eyes*.  It was very clear to me that they simply lazily plugged the tired old ""DPS, Tank, Healer, Mezzer"" forumula into this game, and gave it a new ""skin"".The other disappointing thing was the graphics and sound.  The graphics definitely remind me of games 10 years ago or more.  Although the graphics are rendered in a more modern resolution (filling up my big monitor and not looking stretched), they simply look bad, like they were done by strictly second rate artists.  The same goes for the sounds/music only more so.  Compared to other existing MMO's, the poor audio for this game is a bit shocking.All in all, I see no reason to play this game (so I no longer do).  Poor gameplay, they failed to capture the feel of the Star Trek universe and characters, and artistically this game is a mess.",2,Would have impressed 10 years ago,1266364800,"02 17, 2010"

Hampton,"[6, 26]","I really REALLY wanted to like this game.I saw the commercials with the sharp graphics and witty funny dialogue and thought 'This is going to be a great game' right?WRONG!And I am sorry to say this.Now,I play a lot of first person shooter games and some are better than others obviously.But I've never played one that had so much promise and failed in almost every concievable way possible.Now,before I get to the terrible parts let me start with the very few positive available.Lets start off with the graphics.They are very realistic and you'll be surprised great they are.The best I've seen in a game of this type so far.The duel acessories/weapon selection is cleaver.You can repair any vehicle pretty fast with a rivot-type gun which is useful.And the dialogue the men in Bad Company during the campaign is actually pretty funny and comedy is certainly a nice change of pace in a game about war and death.And the coolest part of the game is actually firing the Artillery pieces with a airial view a lot of fun especially online.Now,here comes the bad parts which are considerable so bare with me through all of them.Let's begin on the game mechanics.Selecting weapons are cumbersome and awkward.You'll shuffle through one only to realize that you skipped it.And you would think that the standard L1-R1 weapon select system would have been more than adequate to easily get the job done,but L1 selects the acessories and R1 selects weapons.Secondary weapons like a attached grenade launcher should be on L2 and use R2 to fire,but disappointingly enough it's an acessory so you have to select it with L1 which is more than awkward especially in the heat of battle.The reticles are almost useless and is hard to guage if you even have your target on it and the recoil moves it around so much you easily lose track of the enemy.Rocket Launchers are underpowered especially up close where they shoulb be the most effective like hitting a guy in the chest and him not dyingAnd a lot of the weapons you use online and unlockable ones you need special codes and they are extremely hard to get and then even more can only the be unlocked only if you'd pre order the game LAME!Now to the campaign-The story is the backbone to any first person shooter and without one severely dilutes the online part which it does a lot.The whole concept is about finding enemy Gold and smuggling it out so everyone there can retire.Although this sounds like this is a great idea and a novel concept it's actually becomes stale and boring very quickly.Like I said I had no problem with the voice acting,but some may find it to be dumb and repetitive.Also,the intro just throws you into a Russian-type country without any backstory or explanation on how and why you are there which is the biggest flaw in the game.A good portion of the enemy A.I. even on the highest difficulty are dumb and are easy targets.And finally Online-There are only two settings(Gold Rush and Conquest mode).And you can only get Conquest Mode only if you download it off of XBOX Live and please do it's head over shoulders better that playing Gold Rush by far.There is absolutely to talking in this game which I found wierd in a game so strategic as this one.At first I thought my Mic was broken,but then soon discovered after playing several consecutive games that there's simply isn't any at all.This might be a good thing however,because there is a lot of Team Killing that occurs.And I do mean a lot of it.This was preveilent in the first Battlefield game,but no where near the level that it is now.The HUD is useles as well.It doesn't show you where your team is at accurately and enemies appear as little tiny dots that you can barely see.But you don't have to worry much about this,because Snipers rule this game.You'll get picked off from a thousand yards away and have no idea what happened until it's too late.And don't ever EVER get into a vehicle especially a Helicopter with your Teammates around,because they will deliberately shoot at you until you die or the vehicle is rendered completely useless.Most players also have better weapons available that you do and if you're up against them you might as well leave the game.You only have about five maps to play on and only two of those are worth playing.The are big a bit too big and although you can select which spawn point you select,by the time you get into the battle the actual fighting is now a thousand miles away from you and you'll find yourself running or driving to the front lines.Overall this game is a big disappointment.If you expect a great game you'll be sadly mistakened.I lay all the blame on the makers of the game who should have realized all of these problems and actually fix them.They deserve a special award for poor game design and flawed unsupervised online game play.And a thrown together jumbled mess of a story line.I could actually go on with more problems with the game,but that would drag this review even further.If you have to play this game I suggest you rent it,DO NOT buy this game!It's a waste of time and money.To finish all I have to say is this game might very well be the biggest disappointment of any video game and any genre I've ever seen and I hope I have given you all the information you need to avoid such a dreadful game as this one turned out to be.",1,Battlefield Bad

8463,147977,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B002XNW6T0,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[5, 5]","A redesign of the original ""Mount&Blade;"", ""Warband"" includes graphical and gameplay overhauls to attract a new audience to a good, but troubled, product. Combining intense medieval combat with politics, economics, and courtship, ""Warband"" provides a full spectrum of possibilities for gamers.The game takes place on a peninsula divided into six countries: Swadia (European knights), Rhodok (European peasants), Nords (Vikings), Khergit (Mongols), Vaergirs (Russians), and Sarranid (Saracens). The game's world is one of chivalry and lords, and warfare between these five countries is intermittent and legalized. The player starts as a new adventurer in this land, choosing from a variety of backgrounds and motivations. The character can be male or female, and while this choice doesn't affect stats and skills it does have some bearing on political choices and courtship.Like ""Sid Meier's Pirates!"", the game's progression is largely up to the player; they can become a mercenary, a bandit, a trader, or a lord. There is essentially a large open-world environment, and the player is just part of it. Lords amass armies and attack enemy castles, caravans travel from city to city, and brigands gather in force to attack settlements and travelers. The game largely feels like it is alive even without the player being there to cause things. The player still has an opportunity to leave their mark on the world, though; they can start as a lowly commoner and work their way up to be a lord, a marshal, or even a king.The main focus of the game is on combat, though. Soldiers can be recruited from friendly villages, and gain experience by fighting or training. They can then be upgraded for a small fee (to cover their equipment). Their advancement depends on where they're from - Swadian soldiers can become men-at-arms or knights, Nords soldiers can become warriors or archers, and so on. In battle, soldiers are commanded by the AI, but can be issued simple orders. They're basically reliable enough that battles won't be lost due to their stupidity or getting stuck on an object, which is nice.Melee combat is ""directional"" - by moving the mouse, players can attack either as a sideways slash (left-to-right / right-to-left), an overhead slash, or a thrust. The weapon needs room to swing, as well; for example, trying to slash with a weapon in tight quarters will result in the character's arm not having room to move and the attack failing. Shields are important, as well, since they're the only thing that's capable of stopping an arrow or crossbow bolt. Mount&Blade;'s combat, therefore, has a more ""common sense"" bend to it. Still, it's sometimes difficult to judge depth, which is important due to the reach of weapons and so on. This is especially true of fighting on horseback, when it's often difficult to tell if your weapon will hit or if you're at a bad angle to try and swing at someone.Politics play a large role in Mount&Blade;, as well. By aiding nobles or helping them with their problems, a character can ingratiate themselves into a nation's upper class. This can result in lands, allies, and royal favor. Characters can also marry into noble families through courtship - reciting poems, dedicating tournament victories, and so on. Nobles and ladies have different personalities, as well. Some nobles will think it chivalrous to let an enemy lord go, while others will think that it is weak or soft-hearted. Some ladies will be pleased by sappy love poems, while others will prefer more realistic or serious stories.There is a multiplayer mode in Warband consisting of short skirmishes. These can be either open-field battles or sieges, with each of the two sides being a given country. Players can choose between being a horseman, an infantryman, or an archer (though the Mongol-esque Khergits replace the horseman and archer with a lancer and mounted archer, respectively). The mode is relatively fun, although somewhat shallow.The game's graphics are decent enough - a significant improvement over the low-budget original's, at any rate. The art (used for loading screens, event announcements, and so on) is top-rate, and the design overall is down-to-earth and realistic. Weapons and armor are actual historical types of weapons and armor, rather than arbitrarily designed fantasy stuff. The sound is acceptable, but the music and sound effects get repetitive pretty quickly. Still, it's never really bad enough to detract from the gameplay.Overall, ""Warband"" is a good game to sink time into. The main issues with it are how long everything takes - from traveling on the world map to completing battles, ""Warband"" is a major investment of time to get even the simplest things done. However, it's an immersive, free-form game that allows players to do almost anything they can think of doing in its setting, and that might be enough to overcome its smaller problems.Rating: 8/10.",4,"a good, but troubled, product",1279238400,"07 16, 2010"

The PSP is more than capable of giving players a great atmosphere that's console quality but Ubisoft gave us a flat bland port.The graphics aren't up to par either and they feel rigid and bland.

I didn't get much sleep in the last two days.Out of the four or so games I played (up to around 1920 AD) I kept pushing trying to get that Civ feeling.But today I realized out of frustration that.. hey is just not your fathers Civ anymore.The direction he (the new designer) took is not a fun one.I wasn't looking for the changes, I had no agenda or otherwise critical view of it.But as I tried to play I noticed the differences more and more and then ultimately to end on what is the game killer.Some of the changes and issues:1) You can not stack your units on the same square anymore.You can't move them as a group/force, and nor can you stack them up as defense in a city.That was a big dynamic before.2) There are no more political choices.Maybe, sort of, in some kind of perks thing, but you can not for instance make your nation Communist, a Democracy, etc.3) The tech tree seem to make little differences.Before you would see bigger changes as you got more tech, and your choices was more strategy that mattered more.Example: Before somewhere around late 1800 I would have railroads, etc.; now no one had it, not even the AI.4) The balance of almost everything has changed.Example: Since you can't stack defense, the cities are more vulnerable, and now they have some kind of funky embedded cannon thing.A lot of things that you do, that mattered in the previous Civ don't here.5) Clunky interface, and, or, options missing.After all games, I don't think it's possible to manually set trade routes between friendly cites for example.There is apparently no more fun spy units too et al.6) It's got new pretty new graphics card pushing graphics, but AI turns are slow.IMHO the isometric graphics of the previous was not that bad. It made the platform requirements much lower, etc.It didn't need to be 3D; why?The AI turns are in particular slow.  I don't know how much of a factor the new graphics are on AI speed (it could be a lot more complex) but I would certainly prefer the lower resource of 2D over 3D if it made the AI faster.If at all possible I wish they would have put what ever they could of the AI on the GPU instead!7) The worst and the game killing thing is that the game was turned into some kind of micromanage economics, and Citizen Happiness SimCity kind of flow.I spent more time trying to balance the economics then anything at a certain point in all of the games I tried.  I hit the dark wall of economics and suddenly became insolvent ther forever after.No matter what I did I got a negative gold income..I even put 80% of my cites to gold production and it did nothing to fix the problem!In the prior Civ, if I got a low gold flow I would just switch maybe one to three cities to fix.Worse, the made it now where you have to constantly find and build things to keep the constantly falling citizen happiness rate up..I don't know what happened here and I don't think it's any thing Sid Meier had to do with, nor would he like it.It looks like this new designer was cut loose, reexamined a lot of the Civ and decided he new better then everyone else.The previous Civs seemed to have sort of a logical progression in the advances between the versions.This one looks to be some sort of ""reboot"" that blindly went off into directions that in reality cause frustration and just make the game not fun.Hey Civ 5 designer(s) go and find the original text ""Empire"" games and play them for a while to get the base fun and essence of what Civ was before you killed it.Although slower, have to give some credit for the AI that seems improved in some cases.It seems to finally recognize a big glaring issue in previous Civ where now it looks at adding a city in the middle of someone else's territory is like an act of war.Lets look at this like game ""The Sims 3"", the movie ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"", etc., and pretend it never happened and fast forward to another version where the designer(s) hopefully finds the error of his ways.If you got the hankering to play Civ, save your self some agony, save your crash and go back and play a previous version like Civ 4.",2,Make Civ not SimCity!,1285545600,"09 27, 2010"

About time xbox made a modern jet game!!! Now to the game... I was expecting a lot more from it to tell the truth. The graphics are amazing however the gameplay is terrible especially in novice mode. In novice mode, your plane is way too slow and difficult to turn. As another poster stated it feels like your flying through mud. When I switched over to expert mode, it seemed like the jet flew easier however defeating the enemies became way too hard. On some missions right when you start, someones already firing missles at you and sometimes two at once.Also the game becomes very repetitive. There only so many times you can go out and ""intercept"" incoming aircraft and ships before you feel like you are doing the same thing over and over again.As for during the options and briefing menus/screens, there wasnt much effort put into them. Between missions your spoken to by still pictures of cartoons... they dont even move. Between the game missions, it looks like a super nintendo game.Also, the music SUCKS!!! I'd have to say this is the worst part of the game. Who ever made this game obviously has never seen the movie TOP GUN. The music is so far from what a real jet pilot would listen to its rediculous!!So basically, it's an average game. Something that can be enjoyed for a while however it'll get old quick.

7102,109133,A1HWJ67HTSHUK,B001AWIP68,EasyTiger,"[1, 1]","I play strictly as a single player, and the type of FPS games I like are the ones where you can take your time to assess everything around you, and move about the field of play on your own terms. World at War is a game that rushes you from objective to objective in a limited space, and for me, that takes all the fun out. Rather than dash through a building at top speed because some Russian is yelling ""Get to the roof!"", I want to hunker down and pick off enemies.The realism of the game is so good, it's actually annoying. You can be lying prone and setting up your aim, and out of the blue, a lone grenade or fatal bullet from a sniper sends you back to the last checkpoint, making the game very, very, very repetitive. The grenades are especially annoying -- sometimes you spend more time running from thrown grenades than you do shooting at the enemy.Another problem is that the grenade throwing buttons are located right above the triggers. What a dumb place to put them, because in the intensity of the game play, especially when you have to run, I'm always inadvertently pressing those buttons and lobbing my own grenades at my feet.  Before I play a level, the first thing I have to do is throw all my grenades away so I don't accidentally kill myself with one.  What's most annoying is that when a grenade is thrown at you, the left grenade-throwing button defaults to a grenade toss-back button -- I've killed myself many times by lobbing enemy grenades that I unknowingly picked up while trying to run from them.  (The XBox 360 should have stuck with the top-located white and black buttons from the original Xbox controller.)What the game lacks in, well, being a game, it makes up for in cinematics. The graphics are great.If you want realism, this is a great game. But if you love shooting enemies in single-player mode, this is not the best game -- the realism has you spending too much time ducking behind cover to avoid fatal wounds, running from grenades, and adhering to the pace set by the game, not by you.",2,Little incentive to play on,1290729600,"11 26, 2010"

I constantly found myself just waving my left hand around until all of the enemies were highlighted and I could wave my right hand to kill them. Then for the on-rails portion holding your hand out and trying to direct the puppet was annoying and difficult. I was surprised that the game was pretty difficult at times, but that was only because of the crappy controls. If you could instead play the game with a controller, the gameplay would be so easy boring and simplistic that it would barely be a game. Ultimately, what any developer should remember when making a Kinect game is that you have to make sure the actions the player perform are actually fun to do. Here, they simply aren't fun, especially when the Kinect can't accurately pick up your hand motions. I couldn't play the entire game, as it was incredibly repetitive, but I just really didn't like it.

10831,91885,A1HHEMY96W1M1V,B000UU5T7E,Autodidact,"[10, 12]","Fallout 3 is absorbing and creepy.  If you are familiar with the D.C. metro area, on which the geography is loosely based, it will also be a little eerie.  The advertising for the game was pulled from the Metro (D.C.'s subway) after complaints -- after all, D.C. (technically the Pentagon) was bombed in 2001, and we get frequent terror/security warnings.As you wander through an alternate universe Capital Wasteland (forked off from our own in the 1950s, preserving 1950s culture, and then bombed to radioactive smithereens in 2077), you will have multiple missions to accomplish, a wide variety of weapons to choose from, and a gratifyingly large number of strategic choices for developing your character and skill set, starting from customization of your own character's race, gender and facial features.One of the things that I really like about this game is that you encounter both genders and multiple races -- although renderings of Asian characters are a little odd.  About time that the game world stopped being White Boy Universe.The ability to create new weapons provided that you obtain schematics is an interesting feature, but the components for these weapons, littered throughout the Fallout 3 universe, are the same fifteen to twenty objects, and one does get tired of seeing them repeat.The graphics are smooth, dark and atmospheric.  Be warned that a critical strike is rewarded by extremely graphic and messy explosions with body parts.  I would have preferred a more extensive environment -- too many directions are blocked off by impassable walls of rubble -- but the game doesn't feel short.The combat system includes both real time and turn-based elements through the VATS -- which allows you to spend action points by targeting parts of your enemy, with the probability of a hit displayed.Now for the bad news . . .First of all, the game uses SecuROM.  This is not disclosed on the game box or in the EULA, or anywhere else; and Bethesda gave very evasive answers to direct queries about whether the game used SecuROM.  SecuROM has multiple options that game publishers can use, and Bethesda opted to use it only for disk checking (rather than for limited installs like EA has been doing).  However, SecuRom registry keys with null values will be written into your computer's registry and a SecuROM component will be copied onto your system (the name and location depend on your operating system).  These will be left behind even if you uninstall the game.  You will have to look on line for instructions and a third party tool to clean it off your computer -- it involves manually editing your registry -- not for the faint of heart.  Some people have claimed that if, instead of buying the disk, you download from Steam, the copy will be SecuROM free -- I don't know.  Some apparently had problems getting the game to run because of SecuROM problems, and SONY (the maker of SecuROM) had to develop a Fallout 3 patch.  I didn't encounter this problem.However, as others have also reported, most of my gaming sessions end with a crash to desktop.  Sometimes the program spits back hex code (""Super Mutant Brute 004e901"").  Makes you wonder if it was beta tested.  Save often.The voice acting ranges from OK to mediocre, with the same voice actors used for multiple characters.  Accordingly, some of them go ""over the top"" in attempting to differentiate their characters, which I think detracts from the atmosphere of the game.  Some gamers have complained that they are the same voice actors from previous Bethesda games.  I haven't checked, but if so, Bethesda needs to review -- a couple of those folks really need to be replaced by new talent.Finally, there are some clunky features of the interface.  When you consume food, water or medicine to heal your injuries, you cannot simultaneously see your health rating.  When you engage a NPC in conversation, choices appear on topics about which you know nothing.  In some menus you are forced through the same bits of dialogue again and again (most notably with the vendor in Megaton).  And at least on my computer, dialogue boxes only seem to work with the mouse; you can't scroll up and down through choices and hit ENTER.  (Thankfully, you can hit ENTER when the NPC is speaking and cut them short.)

You've undoubtedly heard that ""Dungeon Siege"" is a game brimming with awesome graphics, ""seamless"" gameplay, and heralded sound. And that's all true. But Dungeon Siege lacks the one thing that it claims itself to be: role-playing. Don't get me wrong; it's still a fun game to play. But if you're a gamer who likes strong plots and powerful character development (as I am), then Dungeon Siege may not be the game for you. However, if you were enthralled with Diablo II's hack-and-slash mayhem, then this might be just your thing. Still, Dungeon Siege lacks any type of user-chosen skill development. Rather, Microsoft has taken the opportunity to present us with a new kind of ""RPG"" that makes your character excel in different areas, whether it be magic, bow, or weapon, depending on how much you use them. Although I understand this thinking and feel it's a novel approach to a game, I would rather decide myself where my character's strengths are. In addition, much of Dungeon Siege is run by smart AI, meaning that your party of adventurers will do what they're told, letting you sit back and watch the melee until it's time to heal with a potion or change somebody's attack scheme. This is all fine until you realize that the whole game can seemingly play itself!I liked Dungeon Siege for its simplicity, as it presents a nice break to real time-stealers like ""Baldur's Gate 2"". But I can't help to feel a little let down by its elementary nature. The eye candy and sound are awesome, but everything else simply feels rushed. Quests are limited, as are social interactions with non-player characters. Too much of the game is simply walking into a field and left-clicking until everything is dead, with a random award of treasure.If you're a Diablo fan, I have no doubt that Dungeon Siege will suit your taste. It's actually less of an RPG than Diablo II, but it's hack-and-slash nature will delight. It's hard to put down once you stop. For those into the epic storylines of Bioware's RPGs, then I urge you to play a copy of Dungeon Siege before making the full purchase. It's simplistic, unassuming tone will offend true ""RPG'ers,"" so you've been warned.All in all, Dungeon Siege is a fun game to play, regardless of its faults.

It's actually easier to kill someone with a knife than a gun!  If someone sprints toward you, don't bother shooting because bullets seem to do less damage than a knife???  Figure that one out.

If you don't like online gaming or don't have a broadband connection, do not buy this game.  The single player portion is short and non-engaging.  Although, you can tell DICE used some good military consultants to make it somewhat realistic in how combat situations are handled.The co-op missions are NOT splitscreen, only with a friend online (just a FYI) .  The missions I've played are okay, but there are only six of them so you will blaze through them quickly.The meat of this game is the multiplayer.  I've played BF games since BF:1942 and BF3 definitely has that solid BF feel to its online multiplayer.  The vehicles are all pretty well balanced and the class kits seem balanced too.  There are only a couple weapons/attachments that are abused, but DICE has or is going to patch them soon.  Back to Karkand map pack just released and it really is worth buying.  Most of the maps in the game are well laid out, aside from a couple that force you into corridor fighting like a COD game.Conquest is much better than Rush in BF3.  In BC2 I felt Rush was superior but in BF3 the M-Coms are placed so that the attacking team has to be funneled into meat grinders if they want to get to them.  I'm not a fan of run under a hail of bullets, hope I don't die, die, repeat as a way to complete an objective.BF3 is better than MW3 because BF3 rewards and encourages teamwork.  You can dominate MW3 if you are a good player but do your own thing.  In BF3, you are almost forced to help your team to win.

UNLESS you go into a different mode which disables scoring as a vocalist. This means,you can still have a singer, or singers, but they can't fail or score. Also, you can't go on Xbox live in this mode. Even if you have ONLY three people playing, if they're playing those three instruments (b/g/k),  it will still go into this mode. Or you can opt to NOT go into the special mode and be without one of those three instruments.So, yeah, you can have 7 people play (bass, guitar, keyboards,drum, lead vocals, 2 harmonizing vocals), but the singers aren't really doing anything. There's lots of info about this design flaw, as well as glitches, around the web.Otherwise, the song selection is great. I had Rock Band 1, so it automatically imported those songs, as well as my DLC (you gotta pay tenbucks to download all but 5 of the RB2 songs. I haven't done this yet.). What little I've played of the career path seems better; you unlock clothes and other goodies by completing various tasks, like creating a custom character, and song challenges. The graphics are otherwise pretty similar. There's more sorting options, and similar UI improvements, which add to the overall flow of the game.

3845,123029,A2Q2A6JKY95RTP,B001UEN68I,R. Garrelts,"[13, 14]","I'll start off by saying that I'm new to the 'Dirt' franchise though I've played other racing games by Codemasters. Prior to purchasing 'Dirt' I was getting my offroad driving kicks with MotorStorm: Pacific Rift. After hearing great things about the original 'Dirt' I began looking forward to playing 'Dirt 2' on my PS3.So what's 'Dirt 2' all about? Simple - off-road driving at breakneck speeds. D2 features a variety of modes though the meat of the game is the 'Dirt World Tour'. In World Tour you'll create your own character, choose a nickname and set off on conquering the world of off-road racing. Events take place in 8 locations spread out on 4 different continents. You'll be driving through the desert wastes of Baja California to the jungle trails of Malaysia to the (dirt covered) streets of London and a few places in between. As you progess with your career you'll inevitably come head to head with various professional drivers such as Dave Mirra, Ken Block, Tanner Foust and others. Eventually you'll be able to race against these drivers and if you beat them you can even befriend them and race alongside them in various team events.World Tour features 3 categories of races starting with the relatively mild ""rookie"" races to the intermediate ""Pro"" all the way up to ""All-Star"". Along the way you'll buy and earn cars as well as purchase generic upgrades for the vehicles. That is, you'll pay to upgrade your vehicles from the beginner rookie level to pro and so forth. All told there are 35 vehicles ranging from rally cars, trophy trucks, buggies, stock-Baja and a few other classes. The vehicles include familiar brands such as Subaru, Mitsubishi, Nissan and more. One very cool feature of Dirt 2 is the ability to unlock classic vehicles like the 1993 Dakar Rally Mitsubishi Pajero or the 1995 Subaru Impreza WRX driven by Colin McRae and others.Before you race you're given the option to set the difficulty for each specific race ranging from 'easy' to 'savage'. I believe that there are 5 difficulty settings in all. Besides making the A.I. more challenging in the races themselves the difficulty settings also dictate how many 'flashbacks' you can use in a race. Flashbacks are like a rewind feature that allow you to correct a costly mistake whilst driving. On easier difficulty settings you can use up to 6 flashbacks per race. On the hardest setting you'll be given no flashbacks at all. You'll also have the option to turn realistic damage on or change the setting to cosmetic damage only. With realistic damage vehicle performance degrades as your vehicle takes damage from crashes. Also of note, besides bragging rights from increasing the difficulty, Dirt 2 rewards players with extra cash for driving at higher difficulty levels.The types of races available include: Rally, Rally-Cross, Trailblazer, Landrush, Last Man Standing and Raid. Rally races are the typical staggered-start events with you and your co-driver racing against the clock. Rally-Cross events are set in arena-like stages with a mixture of off-road and paved surfaces. These events are very tight and technical courses. Trailblazer is in essence a rally race without the co-driver and some cosmetic changes to the vehicles. Landrush and Raid take use Stock-Baja, Trophy Trucks and Buggies and feature tracks with plenty of jumps. Last Man Standing is an elimination event where the clock ticks down from 20 seconds and the last place driver is eliminated from the race until only one driver is left.Each vehicle in Dirt 2 is rendered well including a full rendering of the cockpit. All the dials and gauges actually work which is very cool. Additionally the in-cockpit view is usable unlike some racing games where the viewpoint is so limited that it's near impossible to drive whilst using it.All told I am thoroughly enjoying Dirt 2 and absolutely love the tight controls and spot-on physics. The graphics are good and at moments spectacular and have never, ever shown a bit of framerate problems or slow-down. But there are issues that keep me from rating the game higher.I guess the first thing that I would note is that although Dirt 2 is a good looking game it just doesn't stand up next to the likes of Gran Turismo 5 Prologue and some of the newer racers out there. I'm by no means implying that the graphics make the game less enjoyable, more or less throwing the information out there for those that may care to know.My biggest disappointment with Dirt 2 would have to be the lack of genuine upgrades to the cars. Yes, you can purchase and upgrade to the vehicles from one class to another as I noted before. But there are absolutely ZERO parts to choose from and no real customization besides choosing liveries, horns and dash ornaments. Before each race you can modify basic settings like downforce and brake bias but the choices are few. If you're a fan of tuning your cars from parts you choose then be warned that Dirt 2 is probably not your game.Another area where the game is weak is the environment effects. You'll spend most of your time in Dirt 2 racing in broad daylight and a few races at dusk where extra lights will be mounted to your vehicles. But no weather effects are present and no terrain deformation like in MotorStorm. Not a huge deal but still something to consider.Also, Dirt 2 does feature damage models that range from bumps and scratches all the way to major damage - doors falling off, broken windshields to broken axels, etc. However, in about 100 races I've realized a few things. Either the damage to your vehicles is extreme or it's very minor. There's very little ground in between. I've had accidents where I rolled my car at 90 mph and driven off like nothing happened - this scenario is probably 98% of the damage you'll encounter. The only time I sustained damage severe enough to force me to retire from an event was when I intentionally rammed my car into a rock wall at 140 mph. I guess what I'm saying is that the damage model could be a bit more flushed out to allow for more realistic damage. I think that in the case of Dirt 2 the developers tried to make the game as accessible as possible and thus sort of rounded down the damage delt to vehicles.My last gripe has to do with the menu. I find that entering certain events are confusing. Yes, 95% of the game is straightforward and not confusing at all. But to this day I still cannot find out how to download a time trail ghost and race against it. Also Dirt 2 features weekly community events where you can enter to race - only problem is I've yet to figure out how to do so. Before you judge that this is a problem with me and not the game consider that I've been playing video games for over 20 years and play a lot of racing games. If I cannot figure it out, it's a problem with the interface of the game.My last comment would be that although I'm new to the 'Dirt' franchise I was really expecting more of a rally type game than Dirt 2 really is. While it's true that there are plenty of rally events, they're generally short and more of an emphasis (out of sheer number of events) is placed on events like Rally-Cross or Trailblazer or the other game modes. I didn't realize just how much of an emphasis the X-Games played on rally racing or in Dirt 2 for that matter. Because of it the game has a sort of extreme-sport, ""dude"" type of feel to it.All in all I don't believe that any of the issues I outlined are enough to keep me from enjoying the game and recommending it here. There is certainly enough content and races to keep a racer busy for a long time. Coupled with a fully featured online multiplayer Dirt 2 will be in my PS3 for many months to come. In finishing, Dirt 2 is an good off-road racer that lands just shy of greatness.",4,Just Short of Greatness,1256515200,"10 26, 2009"

Cummings ""Somewhere in PS2 land""","[0, 1]","I have played both DiRT 2 and DiRT 3, which are excellent games in their ownrights, but for new racers or those who might be more accustomed to a NFSseries, Blur, etc., accessibility are not the strong points of those games.I believe DiRT Showdown is an attempt by Codemasters to both:- Bridge the gap between DiRT 4, likely to come out in the next gen ofconsoles- Provide a more arcade feeling game to those players who couldn't play orenjoy DiRT 2 or 3.In that aspect, DiRT Showdown hits the sweet spot. The formats such as 8ball (which will remind you of Destruction Derby on the PS1), Knockout,Hoonigan and elimination (along with standard racing) are all easy enoughthat with just a little skill, you should be able to finish in the top 3 andadvance through the single player experience. In particular, Knockout andthe destruction derby events are the highlights of the game. It's somethingthat really doesn't exist much on the PS3 in terms of racing games (perhapsTwisted Metal is the closest).This becomes even more fun online when you've got 7 other human playersbeating one enough up. Since humans are naturally more unpredicable than AI,it turns into a twisted metal free-for-all and is very satisfying.The soundtrack is licensed and very good; there wasn't one song that Iwanted turned off. Unlike DiRT 3, which I don't believe had a licensedsoundtrack, this one is very good.This game also introduces Codemasters ""Racenet"", basically its version ofAutolog from the NFS series. It allows you to send challenges and competeagainst your friends; these kinds of additions are pretty much becomingmandatory if you're releasing a racing game into today's marketplace. Youcan earn special cars and play in special events through Racenet.So why am I not giving this game 5 stars?- For one thing, the ""damage"" that happens to your car in the destructionderby style events are lacking. There should be a ""penalty"" in that your carstarts smoking, turns worse, etc, yet about all you'll see is some dentingand a flashing red bar on your life. This was more than a littledisappointing, as if you remember Destruction Derby for the PS1, youcertainly know when your car was beat to heck and back and how much youtried to avoid damage at all costs because of it.- The single player game is going to get real tired, real fast, short ofhaving a ton of friends on Racenet to compete against. If one was dedicated,you could probably blow through all the single player portion in a good 2-3days. There isn't much motivation to go back and do them again for higherscores.- So far the DLC is very poor. Mostly, it just gives you a ""boost"" to getthrough the first 10 online levels more quickly. Online, it may give youmore livery's, but at the end of the day, you pretty much just need to playthrough the single player and get the ""A"" category cars to be level with theother online players.DiRT Showdown is a fun game if you keep it in perspective. If you aresomeone who has played other games in the DiRT series, I'd recommenedwaiting for a price drop as you're likely going to be disappointed with whatyou find.

The problem is it is WAY too short in regular campaign mode.I have played literally ALL of the Medal of Honor (""MOH"") games made, from the PS1 to current.  I've always loved them all, except maybe Frontline, for either the replayability or multiplayer (the OLD ""multiplayer"" meaning with a buddy NEXT to you).  Some have been better than others but they've all had their high points that made worth paying the price.  MOH: Rising Sun, for example, was fairly short but when you played the split screen method with a friend next to you or the battle mode against each other, it was very fun.MOH for the PS3 may ROCK with online multiplayer.  I don't know.  I am an ""old school"" person in that I prefer to do the simple one player ""campaign modes"" on games or multiplayer with a friend in the same room as me.  To me regardless of how neat and fantastic a game's ONLINE features are, the regular features should be awesome and the primary focus of a video game designer, with the online features being a secondary as they can be updated later on anyways.Medal of Honor for the PS3 seemed like it was made to try and ""modernize"" all of the previous WW2 PS1 & PS2 editions to compete with the Call of Duty games.  It really does a good job in its authenticity and realism, but the problem is about 6-7 hours (give or take) after starting you're finished.  When I passed it it felt like it should've been at about the half-way point.  Seriously.  It was over and I was waiting through the credits, thinking MAYBE there would be another sequence, but there was not.This was REALLY frustrating, because it WAS a FUN GAME.  It was intense, well thought-out, great graphics, solid storyline and was exciting.I guess it is a ""personal preference"" thing as far as IF the online multiplayer gaming outweighs buying a game and playing it and having fun, but to me it felt like if there is a scale as to the importance of online multiplayer vs campaign one player, this would have been about 70% emphasis on online features to 30% actual one player campaign gameplay.To editorialize a little, since I have loved MOH games SO much the past decade, after playing this game I am frustrated that the future of gaming is emphasizing basically what the internet provided years prior in non-personal gaming where you fight with 12 year olds in other countries online like in World of Warcraft.  I'd rather pay for a game and be able to pop it into my system and play it and have it be worth the money without having to go online and engage with others.  I wish they'd come out with two versions of games like this: 1 where the single player game is stupid and short but online is awesome, and the other where if there is online it is minimal but the single players game is long and worth paying for a CD game.Bottom-line: if you like online gaming then look at other comments for feedback/reviews, but if you are like me in you like being able to sit down after a long week of work and just play a game then this one is not worth the money currently.

I played the single player for a little while but didn't care for it. But I don't generally play sp fps games anyway.So, as far as the multi-player goes. It was developed by Dice who also did Bad Company 2. It feels very similar to BC2 in a lot of ways. The controls and feel of the game are a lot like BC2, which is a good thing. There is less of an emphasis on large scale maps with tons of vehicles, which I also like. Makes players focus more on rifle play than running to the nearest vehicle. The game can be very fun with a good group of players.On to the cons. Sniping is very easy. A lot of matches turn into half of the team sitting at the back of the map trying to snipe the other team in there spawn. Good news is, a patch is on its way to balance that out. We'll se how it works. Another problem is lag. I haven't had it but a couple of nights, but when it is present the game is unplayable.Overall this is a good multi-player title, but if you didn't like BC2 at all, you probably won't like this either.

What's good about it is that they tried to update the roster, you can download newer wrestlers like Evan Bourne and Ted Dibease. I don't know why you can't get Koslov though, I think he was around longer than Evan Bourne and Ted Dibease. Plus since it's a tag team game, it should at least have tag team Legends that won't be on Legends of WresleMania. Instead we get to unlock lame guys like Tony who's supposed to be a soldier Cena met in Iraq. You also unlock a masked man that attacks Jericho in his Road to WM story. Wrestlers that haven't even been used that much of late are unlockable as well. I mean The Boogie Man hasn't even wrestled since like Fall 2007. I doubt anyone will be excited to unlock Snitsky either. You also get to unlock something that is already lame enough in in the Undertaker storyline, Zombie Santino Merrella, no I'm not kidding.Even though Legends of WM is coming out I like having to be able to have the older and new wrestlers have matches against each other in the Smackdown games. They've had me used to Legends in the games for years now, so they should have kept that feature. I also got used to GM Mode and they got rid of that too. What they did keep though...is that anyone can still easily toss around the big guys like The Great Khali and the Big Show. I liked how the Great Khali was hard to move around in the 2007 version, they should have left things that way.The Inferno match is new in the game but it's not even that great. While instead of being called Hardcore matches now, their idea of a new match is Pin Falls Count Anywhere. Which is hardly a difference from Hardcore matches. The tag matches are funner now though with more tag team options. The create your own move feature isn't bad now either. Except I don't think you can make a top rope finisher or a submission move. I also don't like how the theme music of the wrestlers is in the background when you're having a match, is a distraction. I'm also not sure if you can even make people submit to the Regal Stretch, I haven't been able to yet. There's also a bad list of ring music for created wrestlers yet again.

3027,69933,A2L0Q4K5WIA5BN,B000FQBWAG,Killer7,"[2, 2]","It took a while after launch to decide if I wanted to get Excite Truck or not, but I have heard nothing but good things about it so I bit my lip and picked up a copy.  I do not regret it at all.  I am not a big fan of racing games because I always find them so repetitive and unexciting (with the exception of the Mario Kart series).  Those racing games with licensed cars, realistic graphics and physics just bore the hell out of me because they do not offer anything new with each offering they put out.  This is not the case with Excite Truck.To begin, Excite Truck is the successor to the NES classic - Excite Bike.  The point of Excite Truck is to collect a designated amount of stars to advance to higher levels.  You do this by doing certain tricks such as drifting, turbo jumps, catching air, and crashing into other trucks.  You can even gain stars by having a nice crash or even dodging a succession of trees.  It is not imperative to win first place, but when you are just short of enough stars to advance to the next level, that first place can make all the difference.  There are a total of five locations you can race - China, Mexico, Scotland, Fiji, and Canada - each with their own unique look.  Some of the locations have crazy jumps, dips, and chasms that'll leave you in air for a few good seconds.  While in air, you can still maneuver your truck to do spins and other tricks.  With each level, the tracks become increasingly complex and harder to maneuver.  Luckily, the Wii controls work great.  You hold the Wii remote on its side as if it were a steering wheel and you steer your trucks as if you were actually steering it.  It is very responsive and it takes skill to master, but it is also incredibly fun and easy to pick up and play.Graphically, Excite Truck is one of the best looking Wii games out right now.  I am not going to compare its graphics to that of the Xbox 360 and PS3 because I feel it is becoming convoluted to keep comparing Wii to them.  The Wii is not in the same category graphically.  But Excite Truck does very well on its respected platform.  The enviroments are lush and alive.  The trucks are realisticly rendered.  The game never has slowdown or framerate problems even though at times I felt like it should have given the insane speeds at which the trucks are moving through the environments.  The feeling of insane speeds is terrificly rendered on screen.  The blurred effects on the outer edges of the screen as you are rocketing past gave me a sense that I am going out of control, but the responsiveness of the controls kept it in balance.  Another great feature in the game is the ability to change and manipulate the surrounding environment.  Hitting an exclamation mark while driving will dynamically change the terrain in real time.  You could use this to your advantage by knocking other players off course or creating a hill where you could execute a major turbo jump.  There is also a ""POW"" marker that will put your car into hyper-speed as well as make you invincible to trees.  There are a lot of surprises that keep the game fresh and exciting not to mention it gives you great replay value.Another great aspect of Excite Truck is the ability to add your own custom soundtrack through an SD card.  Just upload your own music on the card and bring it up before or during the races.  It makes it that much more personal and enjoyable.  Otherwise, you would be subjected to the horrible, generic rock music they put in the game.If there is one downfall of the game, it would have to be its multiplayer feature.  There is no online play and only two players can play on screen at a time.  Also, there are no other AI trucks when playing multiplayer.  I find it more fun just to take turns beating the main game.  Excite Truck is a first generation launch title and I wouldn't fault it for not having online play.  Nintendo is still trying to work out the online kinks.Overall, it is definitely a must-buy for Wii owners.  The Wii controls bring in a new level of immersion.  I would recommend it to those who are bored with traditional racing games and want to try something new.  However, those who love traditional racing games probably won't get into it.  And, of course, I would recommend it for anyone who just enjoys fun games.",5,Nintendo Brings the Fun,1166140800,"12 15, 2006"
3868,163255,A31GUSMTXJN8FE,B003VKLAAU,H. Jones Jr,"[1, 2]","Bloodstone is definitely an underrated game.  It got very little attention and many professional review sites rated it from average to terrible.  I'm here to tell you that it's good, just not very memorable.  It is essentially cinematic type game in the style of the Craig Bond movies with some very solid and tight controls, good gameplay, and some glaring graphics problems.  I did not play the multiplayer as I'm mostly a single player guy, so I'm afraid you'll need to look elsewhere for an opinion on the multiplayer.&lt;&lt;&lt;SPOILERS AHEAD>>>The Blond Bond Returns:At first I really didn't care for the Craig movies, but over time I have grown to love them as much as the others.  Bloodstone oozes with the same minimalist approach as the Craig films.  Your only gadget is the smart phone and it works quite well serving as a locating device and a general source of information.  Otherwise you'll be taking down baddies with all manner of conventional weapons interspersed with the occasional car chase.  While the game's story is definitely done in the style of the Craig movies, there are nods to more crazy action of the older films especially during the car chase sequences.  The story is not too dissimilar from Casino Royale, and in Bloodstone Bond is on the trail of a biochemical weapon fallen into unfriendly hands and along the way works with a Bond girl type love interest who ultimately betrays him.  It's nothing new but it is executed fairly well.Run n Gun or Duck n Cover:The gameplay is very tightly constructed and linear.  This is not at all a bad thing though, as the pacing is great and I never once ran into a glitch.  While I wouldn't call this a stealth game, sneaking is definitely an option at least until you kill the third or fourth baddie in a typical room at which point things devolve into a firefight.  The hand to hand combat and stealth kills are extremely satisfying and the gunplay is equally engaging.  The NPC AI are not geniuses, but they are smart enough to keep things fairly challenging.  While you can run and gun a little, more often than not you be utilizing the game's excellent cover system.Aston Martin Action:The game really shines in its thrilling car chase scenes.  It has some of the most enjoyable driving sequences I've ever seen in a Bond game.  And they are not too easy either.  The chases are challenging for all the right reasons, not because of clunky controls, but because it actually requires a little practice to get the timing and maneuvering down.  The chases are also loaded with classic Bond style close calls, and feature a variety of vehicles from Bond's classic DB7, to a tow truck, to a Koenigsegg supercar.Visual Failures and Auditory Success:The game is unfortunately extremely inconsistent when it comes to graphics.  Some sections look superb, for example the car chases are stunning.  Others look practically last gen, like the cutscenes as a whole.  The biggest problem I noticed was in the facial modeling, as the lighting on characters' faces looks horrible.  For example, at one point Bond and the girl hop in a car and their faces look as if they have a spotlight two feet in front of them.  Sitting in a car at night, you would expect their faces to have a little more appropriate shading.  The game succeeds quite well on the audio front, however.  The voice acting is quite good with Dench and Craig leading the cast.  The music (by David Arnold, who has composed for all the recent Bond movies) is fantastic and especially thrilling during the chase scenes.  In terms of presentation the game is great, from the classic opening music video sequence (which I believe was sung by the woman who voiced the Bond girl in this game) to the stylish, though dated looking, cutscenes, to the end credits, this game feels like a Bond movie.Bottom Line:Visuals:  The style was good, but awful looking dated cutscenes do a lot to hold back the experience.  Nonetheless, it feels like a Bond movie should.Audio: Outstanding music and solid voice acting.  Gunplay and other sound effects are great and I really have no complaints here.Gameplay: Solid, but not innovative.  The action is satisfying and the chases are a great deal of fun.  Hand to hand combat is great considering it's more of a TPS than a brawler.  Just don't expect anything outside the box as far as controls and gameplay.Story: It's a good story and easy to follow and does a decent job of tying together all of the various ""levels"" and setpieces into a single coherent experience.  However, it's not really a new story, even within the Bond franchise (admittedly it's hard to create a new story in a franchise that's been around since 1962), and thus is not real memorable.Overall: This game is seriously underrated and if you like the Craig style Bond films and can put up with a few kinda ugly cutscenes, I recommend picking this one up.  It's definitely worth at least one play through!",4,"Underrated, but Ultimately Forgettable",1304812800,"05 8, 2011"

Installing took about 5 hours including upgrades. Getting setup with a id name and password went smooth and I was ready to play. Creating a character was somewhat tedious, for only the gladiator looked human. You start the game with a quest giver and go out to fill that quest and return to get your reward, which is peanuts money wise.The BIG problem in the game is SOUND, except for the music. There are NO VOICE OVERS from any of the quest givers and no animal grunts, moans, and yelpings from any beasts you slain either.

The symbols are small on the map to read.The chat text is difficult to read and is set at about a font size of 6 and if you wear glasses, LOL. Lastly there is no in game manual. Maybe with the console version one came with it, but with the PC download version none is supplied. I realize ff14 just came out and perhaps the programmers will fix these issues. But I doubt they will fix the main issue of no voice overs. So, in the meantime I will stick with World of Warcraft and Diablo 3 for the console.

By far Vesperia is the worst Tales game I've played. There are many things I didn't like about the game.1. The graphics for this game weren't very good.2. The story wasn't captivating. It just didn't keep me interested in the game. I know they used the environmental theme for the game. They could have done a much better job with the theme and the story. If you want a great game that tackles that theme get Final Fantasy VII. I had to try real hard to get through the game.3. The characters were terrible. I wasn't interested or cared about any of them. Yuri was uninteresting and came off as a cold hearted bastard, not good for the lead character of a RPG. Estelle was just boring and I didn't care about her story. Karol and Rita just didn't add anything to the game. Raven started out well in the game and I did like him. I wanted him to stay dead, it was just a great ending for his character, but now they decided to bring him back to life, what a rip.The only characters I did like were Judith. I thought Judith and Yuri would get together, they were a much better than Yuri and Estelle, and I think it would have made Yuri more interesting, but the creators didn't take the game in that direction. I also liked Repede, he was just a fun character and they way he interacted with the other characters. My favorite character in the game was a minor character and turns out to be on of the bad guys. Yes it's Duke. I really like his story and character. At the end of the game I actually wanted him to win some how, even though I knew it wasn't possible.Oh yes did I mention was a let down of a ending.

10911,46127,ASWBVMZAGFKXW,B0001VGFK2,Disintegration,"[9, 15]","After reading a plethora of reviews stating this game is the greatest GTA game yet, and considering I was a huge fan of Vice City, I just had to dish out 50 bucks for this game. Was it worth it? Well, overall I would say it definitely was worth it, just because of the sheer amount of things this game allows the player to do. You can swim, go to the gym, gain stats, date girls, do drive-bys, and a whole array of other things. However, despite the amount of things you can do, these abilities and sidequests are purely negatives. This game has a lot of problems, a lot.Graphics- 9/10 I have heard a lot of negative things about the graphics. However, I must disagree. I think the graphics are actually pretty well crafted. Sure, the cars look a bit boxy and the overall look is reminiscent of GTA 3, but the amount of detail is amazing. The environments are perfect, especially in the country. There are hills, cliffs, mountains, rivers, bridges...there's basically everything imaginable. I especially like the blur effect. When you hit a certain speed in your vehicle, the graphics blur, and it gives you the feeling of attaining extremely high speeds, making chases fun, or just making boring, long road trips that much better. Although Vice City has better graphics, San Andreas has so much more detail to the environments and the city, so I give it props here.Music- 5/10 Overall, Vice City's soundtrack is superior in every matter. The relatively gangster-oriented soundtrack is fitting for the setting of the game, but there are other choices ( rock and country). However, the choices are rushed/thrown in, awkward...and just plain tasteless often times. It doesn't make much sense to have an old-school country station in a game set in San Andreas, in a very ghetto area. I feel as though this was put in to add to the comedy aspect of the game, but I think it just took away from the whole feeling.  The only highlights are: Depeche Mode, STP, Soundgarden, Rod Stewart, and perhaps Danzig. There are a few other decent songs but they weren't good enough to strongly remember. Every song in Vice City was practically great, especially the Wave 103 and VRock stations. Vice city had nice, tasteful 80s songs, while San Andreas just has a relatively crappy selection.Sound- 9/10 Not a whole lot to say here, other than the fact that the voiceovers are great. Many of the characters are quite memorable...especially the ones you encounter later on in the game. No complaints here...Gameplay- 4/10 This is where the other shoe falls off the shelf, literally. This game is a blast in some aspects...flying in the jets, bolting across hills and flying through the air etc, but there are way too many negatives here. For starters, the map is tremendously large...this sounds like it would be great, but it is not. When you go through missions, you are almost always required to endure painstaking trips, many of which are 10 minutes long. There is a lame ""trip-skip"" feature, but this rarely helps due to the fact that it isn't offered on all the missions, and it doesn't bring you all the way back to where you were, just partially. Basically, when you die during a long mission, the game lets you return to where you died, to save some time on the trip. While this helps somewhat, it is rarely offered and therefore worthless. Also, you barely use any of the map for the missions. Many of the missions are ""clustered"" in certain areas, leaving much of the map unused. I can think of several large areas of the map which are COMPLETELY left out of the missions, which is a let-down considering these places offer some of the greatest scenery of the entire game and would have been great for missions. Furthermore, many of the side-quests are rushed and tremendously boring (who actually wants to sit through numerous gangfights, collect 100 items for a lame reward, or waste hours of their lives going on dates with girls which are extremely uneventful and not very fun...?). Some of the additions are fun, namely the driving and flying schools, the street races also, but what about the missions where you are required to fly through rings with a helicopter? Disaster, absolute disaster. Nothing is more annoying than having to restart over and over and over and over (okay you get the idea) again to complete some boring helicopter mission for less than wonderful rewards. But like I said, the environments are the only upside here .Story- 3/10 The storyline is not only lame and stereotypical, but it is extremely juvinile and standard. Vice city had a nice 80s storyline, but was not too far from San Andreas. However, Vice City's brilliance didnt lie within its storyline, it was in the gameplay. Take a pathetic gang-banger storyline with atrocious and wretched dialougue/plot text, and add to that boring and go-nowhere gameplay and you get San Andreas. The GTA series is running out of ideas, which is understandable considering they are purely all the same. However, even so SA is a huge let-down, despite its location/year it is set in.Overall 5/10 I actually completed this game, and I had fun in the process. I was captivated, whether it was to just finish it or I was actually having a blast. However, it is only after you beat SA that you realize how half-assed and lame the sidequests are, not to mention the gameplay. You will realize how little value this games plot has, and that you just wasted about 50 hours of your life on a pile of grubble. I would recommend to wait till the price drops to 20 bucks, since it will take too long to beat to rent it. If you REALLY can't wait (or think you can't, that is), then buy it, but beware it may be an action which you will regret. It is definitely worth playing through, I suppose, but don't expect a lot of replay value( I would rate the RV as 2/10) like Vice City. Vice City still remains the climax of the GTA series, and considering the GTA series is an almost impossible series to innovate, that probably won't change soon. Everything has been tried and tested, and Rock Star is running dry on ideas, but that is just my opinion...",3,"The GTA climax has been reached, it's a downward spiral now",1114646400,"04 28, 2005"

You can now fulley explore islands and find hidden treasures like in the Disney version of Pirates of the Car. which was suppose to be Sea Dogs 2.Fighting has a few new moves but is pretty much the same as you can parry. But the game is still clunky when moving your charactor on land or in hand to hand battles.breakdown:Gameplay: B (many new quests and better sotryline bring this score up and the new roll playing P.I.R.A.T.E.S system bring this score up)Plot: C (don't really have one as its a open ended game)Value: B- ($29.99 is really too high of a price in a old tech game more like $19.99)Sound: B- (voice acting is not this games strong point)Graphics: C- (need better island and land textures as well as town buildings)Replay Value: B (neverending amount of quests and things to do make this one long game)Overall: B (average pirates roll playing game that is a rare gem and worth playing for those who don't mind its game flaws and outdated graphical textures)Ship combat remains the same but some new features have been added such as traveling in a row boat to another friendly ship (not enemy) and is a neat addition. You can advance time as well but this was present in the last version. Now it seems you can install new canons on your ship and have up to four allied ships at one time traveling with you.The games quests are more numerous but some seem tacked on. I only played through the beginning of them and they are vague on telling you hints or what exactly to do to complete them. Still some are really interesting such as treasure hunting maps.The world map is much larger incompassing most of the Car. sea and even Central America and Northern South America. You have new cities such as Belize, Puerto Bello, Panama, Caracos Trinidad & Tobago and Lake Texcoco Tenochtitlan in Central America. It now seems to take a good deal of time to cross the entire map area but makes it more real.The new PIRATES roll playing system adds new characteristics such as Power, Insight, Endurance and Success. There are seven total. The other charactor attributes from the last game are present and you can choose from four classes such as a Adventurer, Merchant and Corsiar the hardest since it means a pirate class (a enemy to all).The same countries are present like the Dutch which are well rounded, Spain the most powerful, England Spain's spiritual enemy and France the Dutch ally and England top rival. Of course there is a pirate faction but this is hard since you are a out cast and I would recommend playing for one of the other nations above first then going for the pirate class after you gain experience with the game.The graphics are outdated and the resolution only goes to 1280x1024 which on a 22' wide screen monitor the game looks kind of distorted. Textures especially land on the islands need updated badly but charactor and ship textues look decent. Water textures are this games strong point of course but other textures mentioned need updated.Sounds are meh. You have background music that is OK but I found it annoying as it repeats over and over so I turned it off. Most charactors have one intro voice and after that its text when talking to individuals. Combat sounds such as canons and gun sound weak but pass for immersion.Overall you have a game here that Age of pirates Car. Tales should have been.

6097,27735,AQ7OZH6CSCTY6,B00006599Q,"""fjdmpd""","[7, 10]","Turok: Evolution is the next-gen update to the popular first person shooter series from the N64. I've played none of the games in the series, but if this game is suppose to represent why these games were so popular (and as I've heard, good), then I guess I didn't miss out on a whole lot.  Turok: Evolution was a highly hyped title, but unfortunately, it doesn't live up to its great expectations.For the record, I played the Xbox version of this game (it's also hitting the Gamecube and PS2).  Obviously, this game (as well as Acclaim, the game's makers) hopes to dethrone the current FPS champion, Halo, but it sadly doesn't come close.  The graphics have some nice effects, such as the beautiful looking water, but the character models are only OK, and the some of the jungle foliage, particularly the bushes and jungle brush, were flat, 2-D models that look just embarrassing for an Xbox game.  The load times in this game are only adequate, but what really offended me was that the game takes 2 to 3 seconds to load even a simple menu (i.e. the Options menu).  On this console, I expect to press the button and go to the menu almost instantly.  Even The Simpsons: Road Rage, which had the longest load times of any Xbox title I've played, didn't stutter when you accessed menus.  It may sound here like I'm complaining about something stupid, but it really got on my nerves.The game's sound is good.  The voices are adequate, the gun shot effects are realistic, and the game's jungle style music fits well.  The controls are decent for the most part, but some things bother me.  It's easy to move, look around, shoot, jump and switch weapons, but it can get to be too hard to hit enemies.  At certain times, you have to kill groups of ravenous small animals to proceed.  You have to look down to see them, and it's very difficult to shoot them with your guns. Even with your spiked club, you sometimes swing it at them for what would look like a direct hit, but miss.  It's a real pain.  Also, sniping enemies is just painful.  When you activate the scope for your pistol, your sight seems to move around on its own.  You may be thinking that I'm just complaining about a head roll effect similar to Goldeneye and Perfect Dark, and that I don't like it.  On the contrary.  I didn't mind the head roll effects in the games I mentioned because they didn't turn the scope all the way to one side, like it does in this game.  It's like the scope is possessed by the devil or something.  This glitch makes sniping so difficult, that you'll never want to use it.  All the better, I guess, because it doesn't help a whole lot anyway.  I do appreciate that enemies die when you shoot them in the head in this game, though; I'm sick and tired of shooters where the guy is still standing from a head shot.  However, I don't believe for a second that these guys could possibly die instantly by having their leg or arm amputated by your arsenal.  They would be in extreme pain, obviously, but they would die a slow and painful death from excessive blood loss, not just by the dismemberment.That brings up another point.  This game is really, really violent.  Heads, arms, and legs, are all lopped off by Turok's weaponry, and when this happens, the enemies bleed excessively.  His spiked club even gets blood on it after you pummel an enemy with it. This is probably the most violent game I've ever seen, and defiantly deserves its Mature rating (ages 17 and up).  In other words, don't let your kids play this game. If you're a kid who's complaining that you're not allowed to play this game, don't worry, you're not missing out on much.To spice things up, Acclaim included a flying segment to break up the pace, but it's just awful.  Here, you ride on the bad of a flying dinosaur (I'm not sure if it's a pterodactyl or not), and shoot down enemy bunkers, gun turrets, planes, and anything else that these guys throw at you.  You're told in the story that riding one of these things across the Lost Land is the fastest way to get there.  However, the control during these sequences are so jerky, I'd rather just walk there on foot for a week or so.  Also, you'll die so much during these sequences, you'll be begging for mercy.  Well, you'll do that, and belt out a string of profanities so strong that Chris Rock would blush.The cardinal sin of this game, though, is that it's really boring.  You run around levels, graphically ending enemies lives, and either get to the end or die.  It can be fun to kill enemies in such gruesome ways for a little while, but it soon gets old.  Also, there are no checkpoints during long levels, so if you die at the very end of one, you have to start all over again.  One thing that I really didn't like about this game is that the levels feel so linear.  They're pretty much just 3-D tracks, and let you do almost no exploring whatsoever.  You also barely get to interact with the environment.  Sure, you can knock down trees with your club (which is pretty cool) and kill wildlife, but there isn't much more to do than that.The game also has a mutiplayer mode for up to four players, but since I did not test it, I can't tell you about it.  If you're hoping that this review will tell you whether the mutiplayer mode is worth anything, then you should find another review that discusses this mode.All in all, I was very disappointed by this game.  It's not a terrible game, but I still can't recommend it as anything more than a rental.  If you want a good FPS for your Xbox, get Halo if you haven't already, and if you have, wait for another anticipated shooter to come out (like maybe Unreal Championship or Brute Force), and pray that it will live up to the hype; something that sadly, Turok: Evolution couldn't do.",2,Turok: Evolution: A Boring And Forgetable Disappointment,1033430400,"10 1, 2002"

After playing for a few hours, I found myself wondering how a bug-ridden game like this ever got past beta testing.I've listed the top offending errors below:(1) Environmental errors: There was a section in the first level where I moved behind a fence. I came to the end of the fence but couldn't move past it, even though nothing was blocking my path. I had to loop all the way back and go around. This is a pretty basic error, and yet quality testing missed it - not a good sign.(2) Enemy detection errors: I was fighting a slew of enemies on the second level and before I could advance further, I had to eliminate all the ground troops. There was one left on my radar and I flew down to find he was....under the concrete. Yes, this enemy somehow fell UNDER THE CONCRETE. I had to reset and start the level all over again.(3) Poor targeting system: The only way I could shoot a target is if the crosshairs were centered on an enemy at that specific moment. That means if Iron Man was running, flying, or dodging, it's pretty likely that my laser blasts or missiles would miss the target.(4) Hyper-sensitive flight system: The flight controls operate on a hair trigger. If I pressed the hover button too hard, Iron Man shot straight up. If I pressed the hover button too lightly, he dropped like a stone. When I hit the flight button, Iron Man shot forward at Ludicrous Speed - and I couldn't slow down. At all.In a nutshell, I spent most of my game time flying around at breakneck speed with little control, trying not to slam into buildings, attempting to hit multiple enemies with a poor weapons system, while trying to break a time limit.There's absolutely no justification to pay the asking price for this game.

First of all the game does a great job of taking you into the experience because its first person and its constantly keeping on the edge of your seat with its horrific scenarios and how the player can sometimes see danger coming towards them is a neat feature and adds to the whole horror aspect. But the game starts off slow and only gets exciting when your solving puzzles or have a gun in your hand and shooting enemies and or running from them which might I add one of the most frightening moments in the game.The game goes for the realism route and that's where the problems come into play first of which is the sneaking which is not that good the whole stealth mechanic is not that good because the game feels it has to be realistic by not giving you mini map or any indication of where the enemies are or how far their range of view is. So the stealth usually end up being long sessions of trial and error. And your most likely won't finish a level that requires stealth without a few retries. Now another problem with this game is the healing system,when you heal you'll automatically kneel down and start to actually ""use"" the med kit which takes a few second or longer depending on how hurt you are but if an enemy hits you during this process you'll automatically die.I found game to be really entertaining but I think this game takes a step in the realistic approach and it hurts the gameplay and makes some parts of the game frustrating and its as if the game doesn't know its suppose to be a game and be fun and accessible.",3,A game that takes itself way too seriously,1281052800,"08 6, 2010"

There are ample reviews of this game on the internet that roundly disclaim it as an unmitigated disaster on the PC platform and barely playable on gaming platforms.  It's so bad in terms of playability that JJ Abrams, the producer of the film on which the game as based, publicly discredited it after it was released.  If it weren't for the fact that I should have researched this more, I'd be asking for my money back - but seeing how well-known the problems with the PC version of the game are, I have to sheepishly admit that I failed to do sufficient research to know what I was getting.This is so bad on the PC that I can't get past the first real clever bit in the Helios-1 first adventure.  There's a door you're supposed to hack open using the tricorder and holding either the E key to do the hack yourself, or the Q key to have the other player perform the hack.  There's an onscreen panel telling you what to do since the Helios-1 mission is more of a gamplay tutorial.  And the instructions don't work - the door never gets ""hacked"" to open - I've spent an hour on just trying various combinations of sequences of operations and nothing works.  When I look at gameplay videos from the same game played on an XBOX 360 you see the specific instructions on the screen followed using the designated keys from the controller and the door opens - but not on my PC version.So I start looking around the internet and I find that Digital Extremes, the developer of the game, doesn't even acknowledge its existence as their product.  Their only acknowledgement consists of an interview on another website in which they express wonderment at why JJ Abrams condemned their product.So - if you're on any platform but the PC, at $15 (which should drop to free for the PC shortly as long as you waive liability to Amazon), the game might be playable.  I certainly see lots of video of people going thru the levels on other platforms on youtube - but so far I've seen nothing on the PC.  But even on other platforms like the XBOX 360 I see lots of complaints about the gameplay.Although somewhat pretty to look at for the introductory cinematics and the use of authentic-sounding voice-overs for the main characters, it's pretty obvious that this was rushed into production and that Digital Extremes never intends to do anything to fix the unplayable version for the PC.Now if anyone happens to know how to get the door open when running on a Windows 7 PC I'd like to hear about it.  But for now I'm stuck in the tutorial.  And if I ever do get past the door and find the rest of the game remotely playable I might up the review to 2 stars - but based on the research to-date this game needs be withdrawn!-----  Update  ------As promised, if I found a way to open the door I'd upgrade this rating to 2 stars.  I did find a way.  The default key mappings for using the tricorder are to use the L-Shift key to select the tricorder and the E key to use the tricorder according to the on-screen prompts - and when doing so you get the feedback that the tricorder is working but holding the E key has no effect although there is some visual feedback that something is going on.  I eventually decided to try remapping the keys to have them more closely resemble other games I have played. The default key mapping in the game overloads the LShift key and the E giving them context-sensitive differences in behavior - meaning the game interprets them differently depending on what you're doing - and I think that's where the flawed performance starts - however they're doing key processing they aren't doing it well.  In any case I remapped the tricorder to work from the X key and the Use Tricorder to the F key and then adjusted several others to compensate for the fact the X and F keys were used for other functions.  Lo and Behold, the next time I tried using the tricorder on the door it worked exactly as it was supposed to.  I also noticed that my new key selections were displayed from that point on when the tutorial continued training me - which is actually a plus.But all that really did was let me find numerous other flaws, both visual and procedural.  As I should have expected it's very linear, you have to do what they want you to do in the order they want you to do it in and from the position they want you to do it in or you will fail.  I watched Spock walk right through a set of Zombie vulcans who were whooting right through him.  So I'll stick with my assessment that this isn't a very good game but since it's now playable if you remap the keyboard. I'd raise my value estimate to $5 tentatively assuming that I don't run into more serious glitches.  If you remap the keys to prevent the overloading of keys (giving the same key multiple functions) you can play the game but it's a very predictable linear third person shooter with numerous bugs.",2,Not for the PC - and very buggy for any other platform!

2477,154625,A7E29IFRUMWPL,B003JZL96M,"R. Lacy ""B. A. Watchman""","[1, 3]","I played America's Army for over 10 years but it died when the U.S. Army decided to UPDATE it.  It had a following from ALL over the world. I even joined a clan and we had about 40 members with 10-12 of them from others countries like Belgium, Holland, Italy, etc.  I still play the older version 2.85 and still find 170 servers available for it (Sat. Dec. 4, 2011 there were 165 players playing). The newer version is 3.0 but it is so different it is NOT the same game, in fact it is more like a cheap version of CoD or BF.Some of the game play and even some of the sounds in ArmA II games are very similar to America's Army (referred to as AA, search ""AA Army"" and you will find downloads for both versions). I think that the developer for ArmA II probably helped develop America's Army. However, America's Army was fun and easy to play, and it was a simulator too but MUCH MORE intuitive than ArmA II is.One thing that made America's Army more realistic is there was NO single player mode, and you had to go to boot camp and COMPLETE IT before you could play. Another thing is that there was no re-spawning like in most games. You could call for help from a medic but if they did not get there quickly you would DIE. Even if they ministered first aid to you it might not be enough, depending on your wounds. Also, being treated by a medic did NOT restore you to 100% health like ArmA II does! You could bleed to death from your wounds (bleeding you could still play until you bled to death, which could be 1 minutes or five minutes. When you died you had to WAIT until the next round started, but you got to spectate your own team while you waited. Which could be very beneficial if you had some good players on your team, you could watch them in action and learn some good tips.As for ArmA II, it seems very similar and has great potential. However, the computer generated Opfor (AI) can see in the DARK, and see through walls, etc.!! Often I am crawling through the tall grass and an Opfor sees me 500-600 yards away and starts shooting at me, and getting a few hits on me too, and I CANNOT EVEN SEE HIM!! I understand it is ALL ABOUT how they setup the program to detect your location but COME ON how real is that? I thought that this was SUPPOSED to be a SIMULATOR? I am ex-military (4 years) and a retired cop, over 20 years on the force and even a swap sniper for 5 years.In the sniper mission, ""One Shot One Kill"", its dark or dusk and I cannot even get to the target. For one thing I only have 10 minutes and the target is like 2 miles away, it takes me almost 10 minutes to get there, running the whole way, which EXPOSES you to detection to patrol and the troops at the location you are SUPPOSED to sneak up on? I NEVER get to even see the guy I am supposed to shoot ""Spider"". When I get even CLOSE all of the Opfor see me and start to OPEN UP on me, even the armed vehicles!!IF before I get too close, I try to crawl the last 300 yards TIME RUNS OUT. Also my so-called SPOTTER is stupid! He is always shooting at EVERYONE, alerting the Opfor to our position. I know I can tell him STOP-NO SHOOTING but IF this is a simulator I should not have to. Like I said I WAS A SNIPER FOR FIVE YEARS. If I had a spotter like that, I would have him fired or I would shoot him myself.Another problem with almost ALL fps games is the lack of REAL physics, such as, if you are a sniper looking through your scope it is moving around like you just ran a marathon. Or after you have been running a SHORT distance they have you SLOW down and huffing and puffing after 20-30 seconds!!It is obvious the programers have had NO REAL experience and they are NOT getting good input from someone who does have that experience! A good, experienced sniper will NOT have that kind of scope movement, and IF the guy is a REAL experienced soldier, and especially if he is SPECIAL OPS he will be in TOP SHAPE, able to run long distances, WITHOUT getting tired for 2-3 or more minutes.I AM REALLY LOOKING for a ""REAL"" SIMULATOR (Spec.Ops and Sniper), that gets it RIGHT. Been playing almost EVERY fps for over 15 years now! Sniper: Ghost Warrior is one of the best for simulating a Sniper but it too needs some improvements.True there are LOTS of controls in ArmA II, IF you like to be a MICRO-MANAGER (control freak), but in REAL LIFE you actually DEPEND on your team having BRAINS enough to do some things WITHOUT you having to be TOLD EVERYTHING, like, ""Take cover"", ""Don't shoot"", when we are trying to SNEAK up on people! Or just the opposite ""SHOOT"" when they are being shot at!!  If I have told them to hold their fire, they won't shoot even when they are shot at. Ha Ha, I believe in FOLLOWING ORDERS but it is COMMON knowledge and practice, ""DEFEND YOURSELF"" in combat, and ""When fired upon RETURN FIRE.""When I am offered a new mission I must press the numbers 0 then 8 > 2 > 2 > 1 to communicate that I ACCEPT the mission. I should be much simpler than that, like TWO numbers of like in AA, press a letter ""T"" and then a menu pops up with a selection of messages. Some lead to another set of messages, etc.TOO many controls, too convoluted, huge learning curve and the graphics that are NOT that impressive. I had to LAUGH at some of the YouTube reviews with titles likes, ""THE MOST REALISTIC GRAPHICS""!  They are OK but not that great, and the movements are not very realistic either.AGAIN, I thought that this was supposed to be a SIMULATOR?I would give America's Army ver. 2.85 FOUR-FIVE STARS and America's Army ver. 3.0 TWO STARS. ArmA II THREE STARS but it would get more stars if the AI was not so bad and the graphics are JUST SO-SO! ArmA 3 is LOOKING GOOD though.I have NOT given up on ArmA games yet because I see it has, what appears to be, a large community, it has POTENTIAL, and it IS NOT a RUN n' GUN type of game, which I do play but I get TIRED of these 11 year old kids running amuck, and all of the CHEATERS.

The first Star Wars FPS was DARK FORCES, a game far ahead of its time and filled with addictive fun.  Following on the heels of its success was JEDI KNIGHT: DARK FORCES II, in which, Kyle Katarn, the hero of DARK FORCES, wields a lightsaber and the Force.  Both games had intriguing puzzles which were never the same and plotlines which could rival any Hollywood blockbuster.  From this foundation of gaming and writing quality arose MYSTERIES OF THE SITH, JEDI OUTCAST (arguably the best Star Wars game ever created), and JEDI ACADEMY.I expected nothing less from REPUBLIC COMMANDO.  But instead it seemed rather plotless and very redundant.  Their were no challenging puzzles or mini-quests (one might say).  It was basically run and shoot some stuff, then run and shoot some more stuff.  Also the game has several nearly impossible clock-ticking deadlines to meet.  (And on Easy level at that.)Another complaint I have has to do with storyline continuity.  In the REPUBLIC COMMANDO novels by Karen Traviss, the commandos are always led by a Jedi general.  But there are no Jedi generals in this game.  This point is drilled hard time and again in HARD CONTACT.  (There is one dead Jedi that the player stumbles upon in the course of the game.)Perhaps there may be sequels of better quality.  But if you want a Star Wars FPS that's fun and has lots of replayability, then I highly recommend JEDI OUTCAST.  If you prefer the challenge of not having the lightsaber and Force, try to find an old version of DARK FORCES. (I sure miss that game.)  And if you're simply intrigued by the Republic Commando stories, then you may wish to check out Karen Traviss's trilogy.I wanted to like REPUBLIC COMMANDO, but I can't give it better than two stars.",2,"Please come back to us, Kyle Katarn!",1250553600,"08 18, 2009"

The box was nearly crushed from shipping. I told myself that it was probably the post office's fault for that and went ahead to open the box.Let me just start out by saying that the box was clearly not made to be tight/keep what's in it in-it. There was no tape closing it shut or tab, it was simply a thin cardboard box to hold it and make it seem genuine. I opened the box and what I saw was even worse. There was no bubble wrap/etc whatsoever inside; it was just the Crystal case in PLASTIC WRAP. Plastic wrap, really? It makes me feel that they gave me one that had been previously returned already.Adding insult to injury, there were already scratches on the case! What the hell?""High Quality Material"" it says on the box. Yeah, not even close. This is flimsy plastic, a bit thicker than the Pringles' canisters lid.Overall design is decent. In fact it was great. A perfect fit in terms of where all the buttons are and ports.I just wish they would have added much more effort into making it worthwhile.

Especially since I have a white Vita, I can see it easily.If you can overlook the scratches and poor quality, this looks very professional.Edit again (11 April 2013): I'm getting more scratches each day. Clearly not living up to its ""high quality material"" label.Edit once more (25 April 2013): After having this one for weeks... I can only come to one conclusion... it makes your Vita look better when you take off. I removed the case only to notice how beautiful and clean my Vita was underneath and how much smaller it really is.This case is only good for the stand, nothing else.

The main villian has so little involvement, that when you finally see him, you expect him to offer you a grande no whip cappucino rather than be a threat. And theres no motivation thats every explored, so the whole story links together on the thought that some guy somewhere woke up one day and decided that it was a fine day to orchestrate a nuclear event.If you like looking down gunsights, you're already willing to buy this just for the new multiplayer experience, and thats fine. But for a fan of Spec Ops: the Line, which really tries to make the experience more emotional and visceral, you'll be grossly disappointed. You feel as connected to the characters in this as you would to sock puppets. Theres lots of POV moments that're entertaining and even startling, but even when &#34;you&#34; are being executed, you don't feel any regret or remorse or loss. Thats pretty sad considering. Even the emotional scenes aren't very emotional since there's no real connection to the other characters, and you're swapped back and forth between them like so many shoes you can't ever develop that connection.Gameplay is decent, with some critical flaws. Some cover is destructible and impressively so, and so is made of Indestructanium, particularly railings and some windows. Grenades can't be thrown back, and some gameplay is hammered into you so hard that you will die a fwe times the first time you switch just from switching from soldier mode to tank mode.Multiplayer is a bit unforgiving, but can be broken into. Even running up against people with hours of experience on you you should be able to fumble your way to level 2 within one or two games, and from there its more learning the layout and cover.Overall, an okay rent, but so lacking in story and emotion despite their attempts to make it emotional that I just couldn't get it.

Now that I've had the game for a while, I'm pleased to say that I am very impressed with this game.  The physics are very real, with most infield hits resulting in outs, except for the really weak ones to third.  And unlike most other games I've played, a smack off the wall almost never results in a single, unless if it was Darrin Fletcher hitting.  Still, if you want to get really picky, you can complain about how difficult it is to get a triple, even for Cristian Guzman.  The scores are usually in the 5-4 or 6-4 range, like in real baseball, although you do get those 2-0 games, just as you get those 17-11 games as well.  The pitching interface is intuitive and easy to learn, as is the batting interface.  The players in the game act just like the really do - Nomar Garciaparra has a much easier time making contact than Russ Branyan, Luis Castillo gets tons of steals etc.  The greatest thing about this game is that although it combines many of the smaller nuances of real baseball, it is remarkably easy to pick up a controller and get into right away.  A 9-inning game has plenty of action, as well as lead changes, and just whizzes by.  You can finish a 162-game season with 9-inning games in surprisingly little time.  One thing that freaked me out though is that even though he hit .355 last year, Darin Erstad was hitting .220 in the middle of May, just like he actually did this year.  How did the developers know he was gonna start the season on a stinky note?  A couple complaints I have about the game - the statistics interface includes all the stats you could possibly care about, and even includes a qualify option, but is rather clunky to use; the stadium graphics are accurate, but a bit blocky; the player animations sometimes have some frames missing; the announcers can really get on your nerves when they say really obvious points like 'all he wants to do is get the ball into the outfield' 3 times in the same at-bat; in season mode, human-controlled teams are never given credit for saves (or blown saves); most importantly, there is no create-a-player feature.  I say 'most importantly' because of a few obvious omissions, such as Ichiro Suzuki and strangely enough, Rick Reed.  I've tried doing that Matt Lawton for Rick Reed trade that happened earlier this year, and to my surprise, guess who I couldn't find!  Still, these complaints are insubstantial, as the gameplay is excellent.  It's a great 1-player game and an even better 2-player game; High Heat 2002 is a great baseball game that is fun for people who don't enjoy the sport, and awesome for people that do.

106,131260,A20R9Y9MXK5KEA,B002BUSVJO,Amazon Customer,"[22, 27]","First I want to start off by saying that I am so sad to give this game 1 star.  It could have been so great.  I have been faithfully using this program for over 3 weeks strait.  I loved the exercises that it had me doing.  They were easy enough to do and there was some challenge to some of them and I could feel them working muscles that I never use...it was good. (yes the comments from the trainers are repetitive but I didnt mind that).This game is just so FLAWED!!!!!  First there is very little instructions about how everything works.  So I just started fumbling my way around and fairly easilly set my self up as a beginner in a 12 week competition.(you can choose 4 week or 8 week - but since I am also participating in a biggest loser type competition at the ymca which is running for 3 months I chose the longest competion you can on the game)....So it had me do my first workout...and the next day I log in to do my next work out but there is none...since there is virtually no instructions I assumed the game would be setting up my workouts and gee they must have given me the day off.  So I used the wii fit plus to do exercises that day.  The next day I logged on to the biggest loser game again to do my workout and there was no workout scheduled...at that point I realized somethings not right...so I started fumbling around on the calender and I accidentally got something that said ""would you like to schedule a workout today?"" -- Thats how I discovered that you have to schedule all of your own workouts.Now the thing about the calander is - it sucks.  For one thing it ALWAYS says the current date on the top even when you are going into the previous day to enter some calories you may have not entered yet - the only way you know you are in the right day is that you memorize how many calories you previously entered and go oh yea thats how many calories I had entered yesterday so it must be the right day.  Not only that but its hard to get the pointer on the right day, by the time you click the ""a"" button your hand jerks a millimeter and your clicking on the wrong day and since the date at the top is ALWAYS TODAYS DATE (DUH!!!!) You dont know where the heck you are!!So a week goes by and I get to the first weigh in.  I actually logged in to do my workout first...but when I get to my screen that tells me whats scheduled I see there is no workout scheduled.  And nothing else was highlighted indicating that there was even a weigh in or anything. So Im fumbling around (AGAIN) trying to schecule a workout...and the whole TODAYS DATE at the top not know where the heck I am...suddenlly I click on something and its telling me a challenge is about to begin. ????? Im thinking I must have clicked on something wrong so I cancel out of that.  Turns out that apparently you have to do a challeng before the weigh in....but this challenge did not appear as something to do the first time I went into my ""to do"" screen.  So no I just forfitted my first challenge and suddenly its telling me to weigh in.  The first weeks weigh in my wii fit scale was so inaccurate it showed me as losing no weight even though I lost 4 1/2 lbs that week on the scale at the ymca. (I didnt care about that, my balance board is on carpet and I know thats not going to be accurate all the time).All these flaws and frustrations and after the first week I was still gung ho about using this game. I tried to schedule my workouts for the week and it seemed to only let me schedule workouts every other day.  Why cant I work out every day if I want???  I dont know but okay I was still into it.  By the time I got to my next weigh in I was ready for the stupid screen to be telling me there was nothing scheduled for me that day...so I started by entering my calories for that day and when I got back to the screen that tells you what was scheduled it then tells me there is a challenge scheduled.  So I do the challange.  Then I do the weigh in.  Now it shows a small loss.But the thing is - first, you cant be you - you have to pick a character from one of the previous biggest loser season and theres like a choice between 8 people. LAME!!  Okay didnt bother me so much because Ali happened to weigh the same as me and she has brown hair so okay I'll be Ali.  But when she weighs in her weight is totally different from yours as you lose.  Shouldnt the characters weight be the same as you?Okay so by the 3rd week - Im so freaking frustrated with this thing that I didnt do any of the workouts for the week - simply because I cant stand logging in and fumbling my way around wondering what freaking day Im in and when Im ALLOWED to schedule exercises etc etc...so instead I just do my treadmill most of the week.  I just went to log in to do the challenge and weigh in...and either the game didnt prompt me to get on the scale or I must have blinked and missed the instruction...but next thing I know Ali is weighing in (gaining 4 lbs) without me standing on the scale.  Why would it allow the weigh in to go through if no one is standing on the scale???So now Im pretty much done!  I was so gung ho and motivated when I started this but now Im done.(with this game, not my weight loss.)  This game could have been FREAKIN AWESOME - BUT ITS NOT.  They should fix all the flaws and redo it.  I hope they(nintendo) read this because its not easy to find a place to send them emails about their games.Anyway...If you think you would enjoy this game just for following along with some of the exercises - then that is the only reason you should buy this game. As a person who does very little exercising usually I really enjoyed the exercises (at beginner level).  Dont buy it if you think your going to have fun in a biggest loser type competition.

Right now, many of these games were made for the Gamecube and have simply been ""adjusted"" to work with the Wiimote. The games such as Wii Sports & Excite Truck were specifically made for the Wii and really show off how the controller can enhance gameplay. Soon, more game developers will begin to understand how to best utilize the Wiimote's abilities. A year down the road we'll start to see FPSs and RPGs that will compete with the 360 and PS3 for gameplay.Until then, hardcore gamers stick with those systems and the rest of us will have a blast playing this totally new type of gaming console.

Remedy knew that it was primarily an action game; you are Chuck Norris or Bruce Willis fighting hordes of bad guys. It gets tricky, but never downright crazy. This game does. I picked Medium, figuring that'd be challenging enough but still fun. Not the case. There are so many incredibly frustrating details that squander it. When you shootdodge, you tumble into walls, railings, the smallest obstacles, negating the whole purpose of the mechanic. The levels are designed to be either too small and cramped or too wide to make any good use of it. You are constantly surrounded. Always. And the bad guys didn't go to Stormtrooper Academy for weapons training, they will hit you time and time again. Painkillers are sparse, ammo is even sparser. You will run out of ammo over and over. There's a new ""Last man standing"" mechanic that makes you drop in slow-mo as you're very low on health, giving you the opportunity to take care of your enemy before he does you in, but when you have no ammo all you can do is sit and watch as you very slowly fall and die. The story is not a noir-thriller, it's more of a direct-to-DVD flick about Max babysitting some spoiled rich kids in Brazil. That means that roughly 70% of the dialogue is in Portugese, subtitles as well. It's also packed with flimmering video effects, which I have no idea what point they serve other than giving you a headache.There are a few good things about the game though, but overall they are not enough to save the experience. James McCaffrey returns to voice Max (luckily), and he's still a gruff, cynical, tough, mean spirited man. That much is true to heart. The environments, technically, are fairly well made and there are certainly a lot of different vistas for you to see, not just hallway after hallway. And finally, the graphics are quite decent. The characters lack the human touch, but they've got grit and texture to them, and the action part is very well choreographed and the motions are smooth and fluid. The enemies always feel like they're actually running and dodging, and when they come running or fall over, it's always in a convincing and glitch-free way. On the whole, that means that this game is probably more fun to look at than to actually play.

You still run around computer generated dungeons, trying to forward the story (which does get a bit more interesting, but not NEARLY enough to save this game). You still data drain and gate hack and fight big bosses with your ever-growing party (all of the new characters, incidentally, have the most annoying voices and inane dialogue imaginable) until you duke it out with a super boss at the end, and save your data to load into the next game.Of course, this isn't enough to warrant 1 star; indeed I played the first game and liked it, despite being too easy and a bit short (only 20-25 hours to beat the last boss). No, where this game fails is the following: You are actually PENALIZED for purchasing and playing the first game! By playing Infection, you essentially remove half of the levels in Mutation! That's right; BANDAI, in its infinite wisdom, decided that they would put amny of the levels from Infection into Mutation, I guess so that they could bring in some new saps. Of course, that means that they've given the shaft to fans of the game, figuring that we're so stupidly addicted to their product that we will purchase the sequels, no matter WHAT they do. So, there are no benefits to playing the first game, except that you can keep you old emails and character name (whoopee). I finished Mutation in 9 hours. NINE!!!!I've already been burned, but I hope I can give YOU an option. If you want to play 9 hours for fifty bucks, buy the game. Otherwise, I suggest you wait for Xenosaga, episode 2; those folks know how to TREAT fans!",1,This game stinks.,1052784000,"05 13, 2003"

The fastest way is pull back--like you're trying to reel in a fish--and then press the A button.  This tactic takes advantage the upgrades to the Poltergust 5000, and allows you to get bonus coins after you capture a ghost.Also, if a ghost hides in an item...then go search the item instead of waiting for the ghost to pop out.  Some ghosts wear glasses, which you have to vacuum off before you can zap them.When you see mice, spiders, or bats, flash them.  This will convert them into money, coins, or gold bars.

I got the game few days ago. There are good and bad stuff in this game.Good:Bullet time is pretty sick. You hold your breath and you can hear your heartbeat beating in the background while you are going to shoot the enemy. And the x-ray vision when the bullet hits or breaks the bone. I get very excited when I shoot a bullet to hey he enemy's head and breaks the skull.Other thing is the equipment. Triping mine, mines, rocks( cause a distraction), and grenades. My favorite is the Triping mine. You can set a mine on one side and another to the other side. Mostly you can do that when you pass a doorway so you can trick the enemy.Different guns: sorry but I forgot the names of the guns. But each gun is from the Germans, America, and Russia. Pretty sick guns like the mp40, ppsh gun (Russia) and the Thompson. The pistols were pretty good but I use the suppressor pistol.Gameplay controls: for me, I can move the sniper pretty easy. So I can basically dodge those bullets but that is just me and my sentitivity.Bad:Graphics: ok I say but expect better. It is like 2010 graphics.Glitches : there are some in the game.

Unless you're a gamer who falls in love with every MMORPG you play, you probably won't find anything in Final Fantasy XI that you didn't play in Everquest, Ultima Online, Asheron's Call or another PC MMORPG.  Final Fantasy (FF) XI is the latest game in the famouse Japanese role-playing series and this time around, the developers decided to make FF an MMORPG.  Gamers familiar with the FF line will recognize many famous trademarks such as chocobos or spell names.  If you're not familiar with the FF games, you'll still have an easy time getting into the game but it's especially recommended for FF fans who have always wanted to experience the virtual worlds provided in the famous fantasy series with thousands of online gamers.  One important thing to keep in mind if you purchase Final Fantasy XI is that this game was designed primarily for the PlayStation 2.  PS2 users in Japan and North America play simultaneously with PC gamers in the world of FF XI which is unique for MMORPGs but unfortunately gives the PC version many limitations.  For one thing, this game was not designed as a keyboard &amp; mouse control system.  My advice would be to pick up a PS to USB adapter so that you can use the popular PlayStation controller when you play because it's much easier to play with.  The graphics in FF XI are also limited because it was meant to be experienced by console gamers.  There are several aspects that slowdown the game which will go unnoticed by PS2 gamers but immediately noticed by PC MMORPG vets.  An example is that walking into any shop requires the computer to load a whole new zone while most PC MMORPGs don't.  If you've never played an MMORPG before, I would probably recommend Final Fantasy XI as a good one to start with, especially if you're a fan of the series.

8449,10469,AKFE1P1ZDBPXU,B00004SVS3,"M. B. Link ""wildfirelink""","[1, 3]","Mega Man 2(1988). Part two in a series of nine games.The Mega Man series was created in 1987 as a result of an experiment where Capcom wanted to try adding the feature of stealing boss weapons in a platform game, instead of simply having the main character be always the same throughout the entire game. The first game actually fared decently when it was released, but it was no hit by any means. However, Capcom saw it to be successful enough to warrant a sequel, so they gathered all their best programmers and put together what could be considered the series's defining moment. Afterall, MM2 was responsible for Mega Man becoming a household name and spawning TONS of sequels over the years. It's my second favorite MM game(after 4 that is). Read on for the synopsis of this legendary title:PROS:-THERE ARE NOW 8 DIFFERENT BOSSES TO FIGHT. This is simply awesome because not only does the player get more options of what to do, but also THE BOSSES IN THIS GAME ARE SOME OF THE COOLEST MM BOSSES EVER CONCEIVED. Quickman, Crashman, and Metalman are personal favorites of mine. Plus, at least half of the game's bosses present a reasonable challenge.-THE ADDITION OF THE ITEM ADAPTORS. There are three different items to be acquired throughout the game, each having its own unique transportation usefulness. For instance, Item #3 is good for climing walls with, while Item #2 is useful for flying across large pits. These are all much better than the previous game's Magnet Beam Generator.-Now and forever on, YOU CAN SAVE YOUR PROGRESS WITH PASSWORDS. IMHO, I find that passwords in a MM game are pointless because the games don't take very long to play through. However, if you do lack patience and can't sit still for an hour or two, using passwords will help you.-THE LEVELS ARE ALL VARIED AND FUN TO GO THROUGH. Example: Crashman's level is mostly vertical climbing, while Bubbleman's stage forces you to wade through water avoiding spikes, and Quickman's level involves racing to the bottom avoiding the advancing beams. No stage before the Wily levels ever gets repetitive in this game.-THE MUSIC IN THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTELY GENIOUS. All the tunes, with the exception of one, are catchy and fit the Mega Man games PERFECTLY. Several tunes really stand out, such as Airman, Bubbleman, Flashman, the boss theme, and the first Wily Stage. Of all the MM games, MM2 arguably has the most consistently good soundtrack.-INTRODUCTION OF THE E-TANKS. These are a must in MM games. When you grab one, you can fill up your health to the max, but the greatest benefit is that you can save 4 tanks up for when you really need them, such as boss battles. Even with the E-tanks, the game's challenge factor doesn't suffer one bit.-TWO LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY: EASY AND NORMAL. For the most part, playing the game on normal is the best option because it keeps the game hard enough to offer enough challenge for seasoned MM veterans. However, if you're new to the series, playing it on easy mode is a great way to get equainted with the controls.CONS:-Beating the game on easy mode gives you exactly the same result as playing it on normal, so the replay value is diminished slightly.-One thing that isn't a real big deal but has always bothered me is the realistic sense of Woodman's weapon. A leaf shield? Come on. I must congradulate Dr. Light on a job well done for creating a super metal blue robot that can be destroyed by fluttering leaves.-Although most all of the music in this game is very good, the tune in the 2nd half of Wily's castle gets repetitive, and grating.-Believe it or not, MM2 ACTUALLY HAS THE WEAKEST STORY OF ALL OF THE MM GAMES; NES, SNES, and PSX MM games included. Here's all the plot really is: Dr. Wily is back for revenge with 8 more robots to take over the world. That's it. How unoriginal and contrived is that? Good thing this &quot;story&quot; happened to be in an early MM game as opposed to one of its numerous sequels.Despite a few slight shortcomings, this is THE mandatory MM game to have on the NES, and should be the first game for those of you getting into the series. 5 stars overall. Even though the MM series couldn't exist without the first game, it certainly wouldn't have taken off and become a huge franchise if not for MM2. If you have a softspot for good oldschool gaming, then you've come to the right place. This game coined my favorite dialog phrase used in a MM game. I've used it in other reviews, but I'll say it again: GET EQUIPPED WITH BUBBLE LEAD.

The graphics have been cranked up a notch or two. The default game speed is a bit more realistic. The achievements aren't too difficult either. There are a couple tough ones in there, and a couple more that are based on pure opportunity, basically meaning you can't really target them to complete.Now that you have heard the praise, here are the gripes. There are some AI issues that still remain after all these years. WORST of all, the superhuman defensive backs that come from ALL THE WAY from across the field to knock down passes, intercept passes, or make tackles. The biggest gripe aside from that, is all of the DLC NOT being included in the game. The AFL presentation and uni's, why are they NOT already in the game considering the AFL recognition going on this season? WHY am I paying extra for that crap? Also, what about the online franchise mishap? How does that happen, and WHY is that being considered an add-on? I will say this though, as much as I like this years Madden, it will be the last one I buy if they continue to nickel and dime us gamers to DEATH with DLC that IS part of what makes a sports game a sports game.

After finishing the game, I literally spent hours and hours swinging from building to building in sort of a ""stress release after work"" mode. One of my favorite things to do was to climb to the top of the Empire State Building, and jump off in a great swan dive, spiralling down until just before I hit the ground. Talk about thrilling!So, I was excited when I learned that Spider-man 3 was coming out this weekend just as the movie was about to hit the theaters. However, the results are coming off as a bit disappointing. I spent most of yesterday playing the game, and admittedly, I'm not through the entire experience. So far, I've been less than impressed, compared to the fun experience in Spidey 2. Here are some of the changes in the third game:1.. New York City seems much less detailed than in the first one. Several buildings of importance seem to be missing, mainly the UN and the Chrysler Building. I actively sought out those buildling, especially the Chrysler Building with it's great eagle heads that allowed for some fun dives in SM2. Not here. Not, at least, as I could find. The city as a whole seems more like a shadow of itself. Where is Madison Square Garden? Ellis Island?2. Once you complete a mission, the screen momentarily goes black, and then, you are back in the city. I know this might seem petty, but for some reason, it was really irritating me. Once I was done with a mission, I wanted to zoom away and not have to wait for the game to reset.3. The police issues are constantly repetitive. Now, this was an issue in SM2... I mean, how many balloons did I have to rescue? But with this game, I already had to rescue tourists from canisters of laughing gas three times yesterday set by warring gangs. Canisters of laughing gas? C'mon!4. The ""bad guys"" resemble odd creatures from the Black Lagoon. When sent on an errand, you fight these weird looking creatures that are definitely not human. Occasionally, with gang activity, you actually get to fight people, but for the most part, you are up against these Sleestacks things.5. On one of the first photographic missions, you are sent to Central Park to photograph ""lizard like creatures"" terrorizing the citizens. That was just plain silly. I stopped wanting to go to the Bugle offices quickly to avoid any more embarrassing assignments like that!6. The people on the streets are rendered quite unrealistic. At one point, I was transferring a victim to an ambulance on a sidewalk. As I was doing so, a citizen walked right through the ambulance, as if she were a ghost. That rendering is almost laughable. On another occasion, I was returning a car bombing victim to an ambulance, and the vehicle was parked backed up against a building. I actually had to walk into the wall to set the victim down. I don't recall that ever happening in SM2. Plus the people don't really seem to have any sense of physicality. They are frequently walking through cars, things on the sidewalk, and sometimes even me, Spider-man!On the plus side, the Spidey controls are similar to SM2, and zipping along the buildings is still quite fun. There seems to be more taller buildings that in SM2. At night, the buildings look quite pretty. The game seems to follow the movie (I have yet to see it this weekend), and has other side stories that integrate into the game.Overall, I was expecting so much more from SM3! I wanted them to keep the original format of the game in SM2, and make gentle improvements, and follow the story for the latest movie. Instead, they ended up tinkering with what I loved most, and in the end, created an incredibly disappointing product.Good thing I still have SM2, I think I'll pop it in right now and take a joyful swing around the town I love so well.

4547,75351,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000HTWX22,B. E Jackson,"[9, 90]","I know, I must be REALLY crazy to give the Playstation 2 an overall rating of 2 stars. Hear me out:First of all, I must be the only one who happens to think it's a total scam that the DVD player built inside the Playstation 2 was never re-created to work properly. It's really a bad business move on the part of Sony to never listen to ALL the phone call and email complaints that were directed to them about the DVD players inability to work correctly for most people. The honest truth is that the thing NEVER worked right. Sony probably didn't fix it deliberately because the Playstation 2 was selling so well (and continues to sell) they probably figured they didn't need to bother. Furthermore, the DVD player was probably added on in an attempt to make the PS2 smear the competition (which admittedly, was a strategy that WORKED, because the Gamecube has been knocked out and the Xbox never became as popular as the PS2).Even if you ignore all the negative opinions on the DVD player, you can't ignore the fact that the console itself had other problems. Many times the Playstation 2 would overheat and that would cause the games to stop working momentarily. This becomes a problem the longer you play a game because the PS2 was never designed to run for long periods at a time. So what this means is that it's not right for you, the consumer, to have to purchase a Playstation 2 for more than 100 bucks, in my opinion. That's just an unbelievably high price for a gaming console that may or may not work correctly and also includes a shaky DVD player. If you buy a Playstation 2, you won't know what to expect.I think the biggest problem I have with the Playstation 2 is probably not really Sony's fault, however, it's SOMEBODY'S fault. I'm talking about the absense of innovation. When the PS2 came out, there really wasn't much left in terms of groundbreaking new features in the world of gaming. All those extraordinary innovations ALREADY happened on the Playstation One. Really, the only thing the Playstation 2 had going for it was ""more hours of gaming"" and ""better graphics"" over the PS1.Remember all those Playstation One games that were so revolutionary? Silent Hill, Final Fantasy 7, Resident Evil 2, Metal Gear Solid. Those are the main ones. Those games appeared on the PS1 in all their influential glory, which means when the sequels to those games were released for the PS2, really, all we had were updated graphics and longer gameplay. You see, compared to the Playstation One, the PS2 had better graphics and the games took a LOT longer to complete, which, granted, is a GOOD thing. However, updated graphics are hardly a revolutionary thing by todays standards. In fact, I'm convinced talking about good graphics in the year 2006 is pretty pointless. You want to talk about innovation? How about the jump from 2D to 3D? This happened on the Playstation One, not Playstation 2. Now THAT is what I call ""a revolutionary step forward in gaming"".Speaking of 2D games, want to know another reason why the Playstation One was better? Because it featured a perfect blend of 2D AND 3D games. The PS1 wasn't created for the sole purpose of dazzling gamers with amazing graphics. No, the PS1 was created for showing gamers how to have FUN with a game, in addition to the realistic revolutionary step forward into the land of 3D gaming. The Playstation 2 was, unfortunately, just ""a seemingly neverending stream of boring 3D gaming"".You see, as someone who grew up as a teenager with the Playstation One, I can remember clearly how people approached gaming back then. We didn't go into each game with the mindset that each game had to have ""incredible graphics"", we went into each game just expecting to have fun. That's how we judged video games back then. When a game with incredible graphics came along, such as Resident Evil 2 and Final Fantasy 7, we treated them with open arms just like we did with other games.Yes, it's true that back in the PS One days we put the games with exceptional graphics on a different level from the other games, but we did NOT criticize the graphically-average games JUST because graphically-superior games were available at the time. We treated games with good graphics and below-average graphics equally *as long as* the average or bad-looking games offered enjoyable replay value. And guess what? Most of the time they did. That's how you appreciate a video game.Today, with the Playstation 2, people are so concerned with only great graphics that many times the gameplay suffers as a result. This means that yes, the Playstation 2 smears the Playstation One in terms of graphical power, but when it comes to actually having fun with a game (along with the previously mentioned all-important innovation aspect of gaming) the Playstation One absolutely DESTROYS the PS2. So overall, the Playstation One was not only more fun, but also more important. The Playstation 2 ruined the mindset of gamers that ""every single game"" had to look good, and for that, I will forever look down on the Playstation 2. The WWE wrestling series is now worthless, for example. However, I'm not angry with Sony directly, because the PS1 was *phenomenal*.Here's the worst thing about judging graphics- in a few years, everyone will change their minds and look down on the Playstation 2 for having horrible-looking, dated graphics. Yes, it will be the same people who once praised the graphics, too. I guess that's the price you pay for judging the way a game looks and *nothing* else about the game. You watch, in a few years the games people consider ""cool"" today will have no purpose to exist, according to them.As for longer gameplay experience, that's overrated too. Why? Because it's entirely possible that a 20-minute game can be JUST as good as a 20-hour game. I STRONGLY disagree with the people who think there's no excuse for short games to exist these days. No. A game shouldn't have to take a long time to complete. The longer the game, the more boring it'll inevitably be, and the less likely you'll care about it years from now because you'll remember how much work went into actually completing it.Another Playstation 2 complaint- I don't like the fact that the analog stick replaced the directional pad. Using an analog stick is annoying because you don't feel comfortable with it. Ask any older gamer- they will tell you that you felt more in control of your movements with a directional pad. With an analog stick, you slide all over the place. In addition to that disaster, the PS2 controller also suffers from ""too many buttons"". We shouldn't have to have a degree in rocket science to figure out how to successfully figure out and complete a game. The Playstation One had the best controller ever. It was comfortable, you were always in complete control, and it just looked better.Now, with that out of the way, let's talk about the only worthwhile thing the Playstation 2 has going for it- a few good games worth purchasing. Grand Theft Auto is probably the biggest series on the PS2, and guess what? It's good. It's great, in fact. It's innovative too, the only important thing the PS2 ever had. Unfortunately, with games like Saints Row on the market, the uniqueness of Grand Theft Auto is starting to wear thin because of all the unnecessary copycats.Anyway, besides that game, what you can expect to find if you own a PS2 are many (and I mean MANY) mission-objective army games, World War II games, and maybe a few lackluster platformers here and there. Oh, and we can't forget about all those boring racing titles that are designed to appeal to graphic freaks and not to people who actually like to race. The Silent Hill and Metal Gear Solid series were also pretty decent, but, in the case of Silent Hill, improved graphics don't necessarily mean spookier, more interesting gameplay. The original will always be the best.If you like shooting guns and racing cars, hey, the PS2 is your new best friend. But if you want something more, seek a Playstation One. The Playstation 2 is just a long list of mediocrity. Thanks for ruining the fun.",2,skip the PS2,1163635200,"11 16, 2006"

I was thrilled to see that I could play Ultimate on my Vita and overall I think it is just as fun on the Vita as on the console.Lets start with the positives. This game is BEAUTIFUL on the Vita. It is nearly identical to the console version, and nothing was taken out or sacrificed to bring it to the portable market. The framerate is excellent and the online play over wifi is very smooth. There really isn't much more to say, if you own the console version then you are basically getting the same exact game in a smaller package.Unfortunately, here is where the game falls way short for me. First off, I own the original MvC3 Collectors Edition for 360, so I received the DLC characters with that package when they were released. When Ultimate was released, anyone who received or bought those characters previously was able use them in Ultimate without having to purchase again. This was done to be fair to the gamers who spent money on the DLC so they wouldn't be double charged for the same characters, but they are still locked for players who did not purchase the DLC. Vanilla MvC3 is not out on Vita, so any DLC that is out for the game, the player must purchase (Characters and extra costumes). Jill and Shuma are locked away on the cartridge and you must pay $8 to use them, but why did Capcom choose to do this? There is no reason other than greed and to rip off the gamer since this is the first game on the Vita platform. Looking at the upcoming Street Fighter X Tekken title for Vita (also a console game) all of the 12 DLC characters are ALREADY INCLUDED in Vita version. On the console counterpart, you must shell out an additional $15 for these characters. This is how Capcom should have handled it with UMvC3 for Vita. This game is also the same price as the console counterpart which is unusual as publishers usually choose to knock at least $10 off the price so it sells better. I think that they got it completely wrong with the $40 price point, and the sales figures show it. Locking away these characters and charging the same price as the console version is honestly disgusting, and I will really do some research before purchasing the game at full price again. Other than the DLC fiasco, the game has a touch control system, which I find to just be a silly gimmick. It is cool that you can play just with the touch screen, but I cannot fathom that many people will play this way.Overall, UMvC3 on Vita is a good effort by Capcom to enter the portable space. I think that some decisions made surrounding the game were very poor, but it is basically the console version with a few extra silly bells and whistles. If you're a fan of the series, I would definitely recommend picking up the game when it goes on sale. $40 for this game is asking way too much, and hopefully after seeing that SFxT will be the full game with all DLC included, Capcom is taking a step in the right direction when it comes to publishing their games on portable devices.UPDATE: I have found out that if you already own any of the DLC on the PS3 version of the game, you are able to use it on your Vita version at no extra cost if you use the same PSN account. This is great for PS3 owners of the game and DLC, but Xbox players are left in the dust. I guess this is better than nothing, but both should still be unlocked regardless in my opinion.",3,Ultimate Marvel vs Cashcom 3: Fate of an overpriced port,1344211200,"08 6, 2012"

My main problems with this game revolve around the mini games and the storyline. So far most of the games I've tried haven't been pulizter novel quality story telling, that's true, but this one had a main character that was downright reprehensible and she wouldn't SHUT UP while I played. Madame Fate is a horrible character, mean, spiteful and murderous and yet we're supposed to be helping her out while she whines that everyone hates here while alternately yelling at the player to hurry up, why are you so slow? In the first section I was already wishing she'd be killed off. Hardly an incentive to keep playing and certainly no example for children. It's a gory game, but again, I'm not a child so unless I was buying this for my kids the blood-spattered body-part eating dog, pig or monsters didn't bother me. The mini games were the worst though. I could make out the purpose on some and was able to complete them, but for the most part I'd mess around for a few minutes trying to figure out what was required to solve them, then give up and take the time penalty to skip them. I hate that kind of thing: I can get the gist if I'm given proper clues, and then I enjoy mini games a lot; they really dress up a hidden object game. In some HO games I've liked the mini games best. But in this one I was only frustrated and angry at the incomprehensible games. They were just too hard to figure out without long periods of clicking on everything (getting yelled at for doing so) and guessing wildly. Overall, this one is a waste of money on many counts.

If epics like FFIV can be given 5 stars, then semi-epics like Breath of Fire have to be categorized differently.This game has a lot of great features--a good battle system (with the exception of GUTS mode, which irritated me--just give enemies higher HP if it's gonna take so long to kill them); nice graphics, a pretty good story, and--the best part--VERY original characters.  The problem is, the dialogue is so drastically abbreviated that I couldn't feel very much about anything that was going on!  I can understand that there are capacity limits in making games, and that the makers can only do so much, but the dialog scenes?  All they have to do is insert a bunch of text, maybe a few flashbacks here and there--it's not like it would have been difficult to have the characters interact with each other more or explain their feelings better, or sometimes just explain what the heck was going on (example: every time you approach a human villain to fight them, when you go into the battle screen they're suddenly a monster!  I guess you're supposed to just assume that they've turned themselves into monsters by some magical power, but maybe that could've been explained a little better?).  I don't know--I'm sure a lot of people have had this problem while playing the game, and maybe it was really one of the best when it came out, but I recently replayed FFIV and even though the graphics and gameplay were on a similar level, there was a HUGE difference in the dramatic presentation of the story.  (Part of this may also have been that the music was better in FFIV.)In short, if you are okay with an RPG feeling like the Legend of Zelda games--where you only have one character in your party and the game is all about performing quests that don't involve emotional scenes pertaining to your character, then you'll like Breath of Fire.  If you need more from an RPG, however--emotional cutscenes, drama between characters WITHIN your party and not just NPCs, etc.--then you probably wouldn't like this game.  My overall impression of it was just, ""Important NPC says one line telling you what to do.  Travel to next place, battle battle battle, go through five dungeons, battling all the way, retrieve artifact, battle your way back to town, get one or two lines of appreciation from the NPC who gave you the quest, and SOMETIMES (not always) a vague hint about what to do next.

But for reasons that are probably based entirely around making money, Capcom has released a completely butchered version of its arcade fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, on the PlayStation. The only thing added to the game is super cancels, which allow you to string multiple super combos together. Super cancels were lifted out of Street Fighter EX without much forethought, so some characters' cancels work better than others. In fact, the entire game seems to have been designed without much forethought. Even if this were a perfect translation of the arcade game, the simple fact remains that X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a terrible, unbalanced, pound-on-buttons-at-random-and-win-anyway fighting game.One of the few things the arcade version (and the Saturn version, which was an arcade-perfect translation) had going for it was the graphics. They weren't spectacular, but the characters were large, colorful, and used a lot of frames of animation. The PlayStation, a fairly weak machine when it comes to 2D, simply can't handle that much data. So Capcom chopped out tons of frames (Juggernaut does a whole lot of standing still, and his attacks are about two frames). The graphics look very washed out, and there is a completely unacceptable amount of slowdown. Ken's Shinryuken super combo had most of the frames chopped out, and it still slows the game down to a crawl. The slowdown and missing frames are so bad and so noticeable that they have a detrimental effect on the already bad gameplay.The arcade version's big selling point was that you picked two characters and could tag-team between the two at any time during the fight. Your teammate would also come out and help in a two-level team attack, as well as in Alpha counter-style attacks. Since duplicating this on the PlayStation would require keeping four entire sets of animations in memory, the tag feature has been completely removed. You still pick a second character (cruelly taunting players expecting the full functionality of the arcade version), but he only makes his presence felt during the team attacks and counters. To make up for the shortened play time, the one-round battles of the arcade have been extended to the standard two-out-of-three format. Characters also slowly regain life, much like your backup character would in the arcade.This game just shouldn't exist. At some point in the development cycle, someone should have stepped in, seen that the PlayStation simply couldn't do justice to the original game, and pulled the plug. It took an additional 4MB of RAM to get the Saturn, which already has more RAM than the PlayStation, to run a perfect version of the game. I like the Street Fighter series as much as the next guy, but this is taking it way too far.",2,This game is bad,1060732800,"08 13, 2003"

Vaguely Lovecraftian, this is set in an abandoned railway station/railway hotel at just about the end of the line somewhere in England. It is essentially a ghost/horror story. You are there to discover the fate of your two friends who disappeared there while doing a &#34;Ghost Hunters&#34; type documentary/investigation. What you find is far worse than ghosts.Gameplay is the expectable round of puzzle-solving to open up new venues and provide clues to other puzzles. Some of the puzzles are quite challenging and original, others not so much. There was one color-matching kind of puzzle which I solved purely by trial-and-error; I only learned later (walkthroughs,yay!) that I had missed finding one object which would have provided the solution. Nearly all the puzzles make sense in the context of the plot, as do the solutions -- none of the ridiculous random minigames which clog up some GAs, and the work of solving them really does move you along the plotline.The big thing -- atmosphere! Unless I'm mistaken, there is NO incidental music to this game at all -- but sound effects a-plenty! This is a game to play late at night, after your husband/wife/kids/parents have gone to bed. Turn down the lights. Turn off any other music or sound. For one thing, the ambient sounds will sometimes provide clues, for another, they will scare the wit out of you. Oh, put your speakers far apart so you get good 3D imaging. The squeaks and footsteps and voices and such -- yikes.  This game is worth the price just for the sounds. It is CREEPY.  This game is well worth your time and money -- if you have never thought of yourself as a point n click gamer, this could be the game that turns your head.

6926,44660,A3E8OD9EKMMDEJ,B00019AZAK,"The Game ""B""","[0, 0]","I totally agree that this is definetely the best fighting game of E3. There are over 20 characters that you can choose from, each one inlcluding three different styles, one of the styles using a weapon. (Except for Noob-Smoke which is one of the characters that you unlock, in their case, one of their styles is switching characters between Noob and Smoke-pretty self explanatory). There are two words that describe Mortal Kombat Deception-Mortal Kombat! I will now break down my review in terms of graphics, audio, gameplay and online play.Graphics: The graphics in Mortal Kombat Deception are alright, not bad but nood great. Lets start with the good then we can drift on to the bad. The good part of the graphics in Mortal Kombat Deception are the character models and the character movements. One other wonderful thing about the graphics is the amount of background detail that the creator of Mortal Kombat Deception took his time to put into it, great job for that! One other great thing is, i know there is really only one goood cutscene in this game, the one before the game actually starts, showing the intro, but i think that the creators of this game really did what they needed to do to make this cutscene actually worth watching. What the cutscene is, is basically an introduction to the sequel of Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance. Basically, the alliance breaks up, but then come back together again. When you watch this cutscene, in some terms, it seems like you are actually watching a real movie which is really fun and entertaining and unlike most cutscenes now a days where they are all just junk and with a cheesy script.Now on to the bad part of the graphicss. The bad part of the graphics feature is that the blood looks like something you would find out of a Sega Genesis, they really need to work on the violence/blood/gore to make it look much more realistic then it is right now, because right now, it looks really, really g@y and definetely nothing that you would find in an Xbox now a days. I think that instead of making it so that their is an overload of blood pouring out the characters body and face, they should have decreased the amount of blood by a little bit, but should have added a lot more detail/texture into the blood and gore, that would have made this game way better i think. This also includes the fatalities which need much more work as well. But i guess that graphics don't matter that much in a game like Mortal Kombat Deception, just keep in mind guys that we want just a little bit more detail into the ""violent"" part of the graphics, then the graphics aspect of the game will be perfect!Audio: The audio in Mortal Kombat is great, from the magnificent music from the cutscene in the beginning before the game actually launches to the different music in each multiplayer map. The classic Mortal Kombat music has returned- Great job in terms of audio! The quality is amazing, and definetely not part of the game that i should rate negatively!Gameplay: The gameplay aspect of the game is definetely the best out of all the Mortal Kombat Deception games so far in my opinion. There are now three new modes in Mortal Kombat which i will explain below.Puzzle Kombat: A fun minigame where you have to match up different colors of blocks. As one player gets rid of their blocks, the amount of blocks that dissappeared from the players screen, gets added to the opponents screen making it a fun and strategic game to play both online and off. Each character has their own special moves which make it even more entertaining and strategic when it comes to which character you should choose when facing your opponent online or the CPU.Chess Kombat: Pretty self explanatory. You basically play chess, getting to choose your team (every MK character moves the same way as in the real Chess game) and when you come into contact with a player you get to fight for whoever takes over the square. An extremely fun game to play once again both online and off, but can get a little dull and boring, considering that if your both good at it it can take a little over 20 minutes to complete the game. One cool feature about this is that you have a spell list where you can cast certain special moves at anytime you want, however once you use one special move, you cant use that same one again making it strategic to know when you want to cast each spell.Konquest Mode: Basically an adventure mode, you play young Shujinko and you basically are out on a quest to gain honor. The graphics in this mode isn't that great and there are a few little glitches, but nothing to major. You get to do side quests for people which earn you koins which you can go and spend on extra features i.e, making of the game, comentary, characters, extra costumes (etc). Also, as you go through the adventure mode you actually do unlock new puzzle fighters, kombat fighters, new arenas, clothing, music and moves which i found was pretty cool and gave me one other reason to complete this mode besides the fact that its really fun!The actual gameplay itself is awesome. There are two fatalities per character, but what sucks is that you have to be a certain distance away from your opponent, and its extremely accurate and can be frustrating. Each character also has a new hari-kiri move where they basically kill themselves after they have lost. You do not have to be a certain distance away to perform these suicidal moves. There are many different combos, and for once its not a fighting game that resorts on button mashing, which is very good because thats how most fighting games are now a days, they require no skill.Another new feature about this game is that their are death traps on some of the maps, for example, brutal spikes, a grinder, and pirhanas which can be a cool and deadly way to kill your opponent considering that if you throw your enemy into one of these traps, its an instant kill.As a result of the gameplay aspect, it is great, and another reason to buy this hit game!Online play: Mortal Kombat Deception now allows you to compete head to head on Xbox live which is really great. Your opponents are usually very, very skilled as they most of the time have completed Konquest mode and unlocked every feature of the game, but what can i say, most of the competitive people on Xbox Live are good at what they play. There is a ranking system and you are able to play either Puzzle, Chess or normal Kombat which i thought was really cool seeing that my first reaction to the online play was that you could only fight with your opponents in Kombat mode, but fortunetely i was wrong.The only problem that i have to say there is with Mortal Kombat Deception on Xbox Live is that if the connections start to fail even a bit you will get a disconnect which shows up on your ""profile."" This can get really frustrating if your winning for once and then the game disconnects. It usually happens one in every six-seven games that you play, so as you can see it is quite a frequent error, even if you have a good connection.But overall, Mortal Kombat definetely has a descent online feature and is definetely worth spending $50 on the game for.One of the problems that i have though with Mortal Kombat is when your playing Kombat Mode, the boss, the dragon, is incredibly cheap as if he grapples you once, almost one quarter of your health is taken away. But thats not that bad is it...In conclusion, Mortal Kombat can be hard and frustrating at times, and the graphics could need a little work on, but the gameplay itself is amazing with two fatalities per character, new gameplay modes, many characters and by far the best audio in the whole MK series!",4,Extremely fun/gruesome!,1112400000,"04 2, 2005"

The most accurate description I read was that it handled like ""a boat on ice"". lol Quite accurate! (I drive a boat too)However, I was slow to review as I felt I needed time to tweak the game and wheel and rule out a settings error.  But the sensation was way off and I had to adapt to a very unrealistic, sloppy steering style to counter the behavior of the game. Not fun and ""hard"" for all the wrong reasons. I use the Hard/Elite setting as I love a racing challenge, I don't want anything to be so easy I can win all the time, but I want to loose for poor driving, not poor game design.While turning corners the Logitech wheel lost resistance/feedback and moved freely which made it feel as though the car was sliding (as it would on snow or ice). I could understand this if I was driving at a high rate of speed and lost traction or possible just driving an ill-equipped vehicle, but my SUV handles better than this, it simply was not realistic. Was this the designers way of simulating drift or loss of traction? If it was it certainly wasn't working.THEN CAME THE PATCH.  I downloaded it completely unaware of what to expect. Man, what a difference a patch makes! No kidding, this turned a stinker into a contender. Now I am beginning to think the issues were related to the interaction between the game and the controller.The G27 wheel now shows resistance throughout it's rotation. No more loose, sliding on ice feel while turning a corner. No more feeling as though there is a delay in response.I am still playing with wheel settings...having the Steering Lock at 900 had me turning hand over hand over hand. I made adjustments to sync with the cockpit wheel on screen. Sometimes I personally have to turn down the strength of Force Feedback on some games (not sure about this one yet) when using the H shifter instead of the Paddles.

It drives me crazy how a system with everything the PS3 boasts (outstanding graffix, HDMI, Blu Ray Player, etc), and it seems like there are only a couple great games for it. Ninja Gaiden is awesome, but the overall roster of games just flat out isnt getting it done. Maybe I just had too high of expectations, but PS3- exclusive titles seem to be disappearing as well. There have already been a couple games that were hyped to be great, but they turned out to be anything but great. Hopefully Sony will get things together soon. Im playing more 360 than I would have liked.Bottomline, the Wii also struggles with a shallow roster of great games, but the Wii DOES have a lot of good games- especially for my children.

The 360 does have hardware malfunctions, but Microsoft has stepped up to the plate and extended the warranty AND fixed the problem in new consoles manufactured (from what I gather).

After finally playing it, I don't quite know what game he was talking about.The areas are a bit more open and sometimes you can run away, but you still have the scenarios where you have to beat all the guys to clear a door seal.  There doesn't seem to be nearly enough enemy activity or orbs to go around.  My suggestion, with Dante just upgrade the uzi style guns as much as possible and the rocket launcher is handy too.  You'll find it in this obnoxious level where you have to go track down 4 glowing balls in order to open a portal inside a giant starfish.  The launcher isn't too far from one of the balls and it's in a corner.  Of anything you could miss, that's probably the most critical to find.You also find orb/crystal things that give you demon powers when you max your bar.  Like one for flight.  Then inexplicably you can't fly in most later levels.  Wtf?!?  A lot of weird little stuff like that.  Lucia, I'd say just upgrade her knives.  She's a lot weaker than Dante so they don't even send her against at least one of the nastier bosses and she has one fewer levels since she doesn't fight one of the fights vs. the big boss guy.  The worst thing about most any of the fights is the fixed camera, which is almost categorically awful and the targeting system which can make fights way harder than they should be.Stuff doesn't make sense in the &#34;plot&#34;, what there is of one.  I'll sum it up, demon fighting tribe asks for help from Dante and he apparently knows them, or just acts like he does, or whatever, then stuff happens and he brings random items A through D to the big boss guy for...I give up, not a clue.  Then stuff gets shot and you win.The game is relatively short.  The game is relatively easy.  Lucia's has two of the most annoying fights I've seen in a while.  One is against a giant fish where you just sort of move and you win and then the final end boss one is not difficult, just long and tedious while you run him down...then a minor twist, but as long as you have most of your health soon, which you should, you're fine.

Kudos to Taito/Square Enix for breathing new life into this classic while keeping true to the spirit of the original. Space Invaders Extreme is just as the title suggests: it's space invaders, but taken to extremes. It's the same fast-paced and frenetic game as the original, requiring quick shooting and reflex, but ramped up with some insanely lush graphics and a few modern twists, like bosses, weapons, and pretty animation effects. Animations are smooth and the graphics are excellent, colorful and psychedelic, with lots of glitter and eye-candy everywhere. Some level backgrounds look like what you'd see in the graphics visualizer on music programs. It's all very beautiful and smooth.Weapons drops are laser, shotgun, and bomb (a grenade launcher-like exploding shell) and last about 5 seconds. I love the laser. Every time I get it, the aliens are in for a world of hurt. Its a continuous beam of energy that just decimates the aliens as they fly into it. Each level is divided into several waves, during which you can earn bonuses. Different words light up on the field, like in pinball. When you activate the bonus (shoot a column of aliens, a row, or a group of the same color, for example), you are warped to a timed bonus level. If you achieve the objective, you go into Frenzy Mode for a limited time where you earn more points. One complaint though is that scores and bonus are shown on the top screen. You're too busy dodging fire to look up there.Boss stages and bonus levels take up both screens of the DS, which is fun because many games don't use this space wisely. Level bosses are huge and inventive, and a whole lot of fun to battle. After beating a level, you can select it to play again in Stage Mode. You can continue for as many times as you want if you lose all your lives, but at the beginning of the stage (wave 1), making it a more challenging than just letting you continue infinitely on the wave you were last playing.Overall, Space Invaders Extreme feels very refined and polished, with an attractive layout, clean UI design, and pleasant female voice announcing level starts and weapons upgrades.

When the novelty of that wears off, what you have left is an incredibly repetitive game with a godawful camera and an ill-advised control scheme.Yes, bonus marks are in order for using Cantonese in Hong Kong with subtitles.  (As a native Hong Kong person I can say the dialogue is less stilted than usual, though still flawed)  Though I might add that international espionage games like Syphon Filter has been doing that for years.  The settings are authentic enough, with the battles in the Hong Kong settings being especially evocative of kung fu films.But is it worth the very problematic gameplay?  Just barely.  If you've seen/played the demo already, you'll know that the entire fight system consists of slapping the right analog stick.  While the array of moves you can unleash is impressive, motion-captured well from Li's own silhouette, this system is very ill conceived from a fighting-game perspective.  Worse still, the camera is so restless that you could be in the middle of a combo against an enemy, and then the perspective shifts so that you're suddenly hitting at air and the enemy's to the side.  So many game designers have misled notions about being filmmakers, not realizing that the best perspective for gaming is a fixed perspective.  This problem came to a head during the ludicrous ""escape from capture"" stage where the camera actually cuts you off, preventing you from seeing what's behind you, even though there are guards sweeping flashlights that way that you're supposed to avoid!  This is simply a moronic use of the camera.Aside from this, the fighting gets tired awfully quickly, especially since the designers committed the ol' ""this level never ends"" sin.  This game alleviates this problem by having lots of checkpoints where you can continue the game, but during some of the ""one against 14"" stages, the endless brawling still gets tired.  And whose idea was it to have enemies pull off 18-hit combos, where if you get hit the first time, you get to watch your character get pummelled for 10 seconds straight?I actually find the gunfight segments of this game more fun than the endless, endless hand-to-hand stages.  This is where the dual analog sticks truly shine, allowing you to smoothly run from spot to spot forwards and backwards while your hands can aim independently and a top button allows you to do Time Crisis-style ducking.  There's even a crazy level where you fight off about 100 enemies with two nailguns!This game would probably remain tempting to Jet Li fans because of the role-playing aspect of it.  And I wouldn't blame them -- this was my reason for buying this game, and there are a few levels that I truly enjoyed.

Its combination of economics, politics, and warfare provides a much richer experience than the typical build and conquer style strategy games.Here are the high points:* Large scale conquest is impractical and difficult. You won't find it easy to win the game by wiping out the competition. This means you actually have to think!* The political system is rich and diverse, allowing you to actively make efforts to improve relations.* The large number of nations makes realistic alliances possible.* The economic system is simple enough to be playable, but diverse enough to be interesting.Here are some problems:* The game is supposed to be historically accurate, but it defies this in two serious ways:1.) The nature of exploration is unrealistic. Because all military units have an attrition rate that increases with time, you cannot send out long expeditions (making circumnavigation impossible). Also, you can't bring ships into a safe harbor in unknown lands to refresh the crew.2.) When you discover the new world empires (Aztecs, etc.), they are treated exactly the same as the old world countries politically. This means you have to have a valid cause to attack them. In history, the cultures of the new world were exempted from the rules of war.* The focus on history also limits your choices. As far as I can tell, you only get explorers (which allow you to move into uncharted map spaces) that correspond with actual famous explorers from the country you are playing. Some countries will therefore get a big advantage that others don't have.In conclusion, EU II is a good game with a lot of fresh ideas, but it has some limiting factors that can easily turn you off. It is worth a look if you are a thinking strategy fan, but is probably not a good choice if your interest in strategy is limited to traditional (War Craft style) real-time games.I found that, after playing this game for a while, I went back to Imperialism II, which is a much superior game.",3,Great concept with some problems,1022544000,"05 28, 2002"

You have your choice of which tribe you want to be and which tribe you want to play against. You can either play as one of the Survivors from the TV show or you can make your own custom character. When the game starts, you see some pretty good shots that are from the TV show and you see the real characters when they go fo mail and stuff like that. But then the game gets a little tough too swallow. You have around 3 1/2 to 4 minutes to &quot;talk&quot; to the other characters. It's basically the same questions over and over. Then you have the reward challenge. Some of the challenges are Ok, but most are just stupid. After that, then you go back to &quot;talking&quot; again. Then you do the immunity challenge. If you lose, you vote someone off. There is no way to speed up any of these processes. You have to suffer through some very tedious and boring aspects of this game. The graphics of the characters and of the landscape around you aren't very good and the AI (artificial intelligence) in the game is horrible. I had 3 people in my tribe that I gave weak emotional energy to and talked bad about them and they still thought we had an alliance. A tribe member will say that you should watch yourself and you ask what have you heard and they say not much. That's it. And during the challenges, you can't even see what the other tribe scored or how close to winning they are in most of them. And the internet play, you might as well forget it. I thought it would be fun to play over the internet but because the game doesn't have anyone supporting it, it's nearly impossible find anyone playing it.

3676,139383,AXKOIBI3C9NT2,B002I0J5FG,Matt,"[13, 26]","I played both of these games back when they first came out on the PS2 and remember kinda enjoying them. Given all the effulgent gushing and kiss-blowing from so many other reviewers on various websites, I felt like I probably enjoyed both games more than I had remembered, and ended up buying this ""remastered"" collection. Turns out, I guess I had it backward, as both ICO and SOC ended up being very frustrating game experiences for me, each in their own ways.ICOThere exists a small group of dedicated and vocal gamers who seem to really like the concept of videogames as art. While I don't have a problem with the fundamental idea (I loved Okami), I do have a major problem with development studios who hide poor game and programming design behind artsy camera angles and atmosphere, and try to pass it off as a videogame masterpiece. After having played through ICO (and also SOC) my opinion of Team ICO is that they are obviously very interested in creating art, but lack the technical knowlege required to craft a playable video game around it, and ultimately would be better off shooting an independent film or painting a series of pictures and then staring at them pensively.Did I like anything about ICO? Yeah, I like the environmental puzzles, where the goal is always to figure out how to open a door or reach a certain ledge, and most of the solutions are logical (as environmental puzzles should be). That's about it though, as just about everything else in the game frustrated me almost to the point of quitting early (I didn't though, as I wanted to unlock all the trophies).The things that crippled the game experience for me were the controls, the camera, the friendly AI, and the horribly boring and repetitive fights. The controls lack responsiveness and feel sluggish. Grabbing a hold of ladders or dangling chains is often far more difficult than it needs to be, and if a torch and switch are next to each other, it's not unusual to see your character grab the one you don't intend for him to grab. Repeatedly. The controls are also constantly locked in mortal combat with the semi-fixed camera angles. What this means is since your character moves in direct relation to the direction you're pushing, if you're holding right and running down the hallway and the camera decides to swing more to the right to face you, you'll end up running into the wall since the wall is now directly to your right and that's still the direction you're pushing. It's lazy programming, and most other third person game developers have figured out how to deal with this irritation. The camera also has the annoying habit of swivelling around to face your character as he's moving, so that you can't see what's coming up without using the right analog stick to move the entire camera frame to the right (the only real camera control the game allows the player), leaving your character out of the picture, and providing a terribly disorienting angle on the gameplay. It's just bad design, and no other game that I can think of has this set-up.The friendly AI is an abject failure of videogame programming. What more can be said? Yorda has serious issues with following commands, and it's all too common to see her struggle with climbing onto ladders or even continuing to climb up ladders without inexplicably reversing tack and climbing back down. She can't drop down a 4 foot ledge in one room, but she can drop down a different 4 food ledge in another room. And God forbid you get in a hurry, as Yorda has the nasty habit of strolling along when you need her to run quickly (like in battles). The whole thing is incredibly irritating and makes it feel like your main goal of the entire game is to babysit a slow child... which I guess it pretty much is.Battles are boring and one dimensional and involve wailing on wave after wave of shadow creature with your trusty 2x4 or sword. Some battles can be avoided, fortunately, but avoidance frequently leads you into an even greater battle as the controls and camera once again tagteam your escape efforts. Honestly, the battles should've just been removed. They add nothing to the game and only detract from it.Can't comment on the music since there really isn't any. If you get a hard-on listening to endless feet clacking on stone, or wind rustling, or the odd phrase ""bon swah"" repeated over and over and OVER AGAIN, then you're in luck.I can't help but feel like this game would be better served as a downloadable title for like $10 max.SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUSI spent more text than I thought I would describing ICO, so I'll keep the SOC part briefer. Overall, it's a better game than ICO, but it has its very own set of design flaws which seriously maimed a game experience that should otherwise be amazing. There is little doubt that Team ICO made this game, given their efforts with ICO.You have full camera control this time around, but it's not what I thought it'd be. Most third person games provide the player with limited camera control in which the game keeps the camera behind your character and moves accordingly as you move your character, but still allows you to move the camera yourself if necessary. In SOC, there is no automatic camera control by the game. What this means is that if you're doing more than moving in a straight line, you're going to have to have one thumb on the right analog stick moving it AT ALL TIMES. Take a break for a second, and you'll find your character moving to the side of the screen or facing you, providing you with absolutely no warning of what's coming up. Pull out your bow while running toward the screen (toward you) and your character aims/shoots at you instead of the colossus in the background (which is indescribably backward compared to other games in which your character usually immediately faces the enemy). Controlling the horse while using the camera is also bizarrely overcomplicated and has you doing thumb aerobics switching back and forth between the X button for ""speed up horse"" and the right thumb stick for camera control. The control/camera set-up is poorly thought out and should have been simplified.... especially for a game that prides itself on its relaxed atmosphere.The controls (like ICO) are sluggish and don't feel very responsive. Button presses while climbing/battling a colossus are treated by the game as less of a distinct command and as more of a polite request.... a request that is often blatantly ignored. While some of the time it's the game simply not responding to input by the player, oftentimes it's because your character is too busy flopping around on the colossus like a edematous skin tag to pay attention to anything you're asking him to do. ""Please jump from the colossus's arm to his back."" ""Sorry can't do that, as he's breathing heavily right now, and for some reason I can't stop seizing like an epileptic when the colossus is doing anything other than standing completely still."" Where this becomes really stupid is when a colossus gets stuck in an endless loop of shaking, essentially rendering you immobile (yet floppy) until your grip runs out, and you fall to the ground, only to begin the climbing process yet again. Considering that the vast bulk of the SOC game experience revolves around this kind of stuff, I quickly found myself getting frustrated, bored, and not having fun. And videogame are supposed to be fun, right? If you don't believe this, you're playing them for the wrong reason.I'll stop there, as this is getting too long already. What makes SOC game so annoying is not the individual design problems in isolation, it's how they conspire against you all at once, and throughout the entire game. Seriously, if the controls and camera were improved, intuitive, and responsive, then I would've rated this game much higher. Both games, in fact. But just a few design flaws can ruin a game if they're frustrating enough. Life's too busy to waste this kind of time on poor/lazy game design.**The music is incredible, by the way, and is some of the best I've experienced in the medium. For this reason, I bumped the overall rating from one star to two. Really, I should've just bought the official SOC soundtrack and saved myself the wasted time. Hindsight's 20/20.-------So that's my differing opinion on the ICO/SCO collection. Not that it's going to persuade anyone to avoid these games, but I find it's always refreshing to hear a viewpoint different from that of the majority.

It's slightly tedious but generally fun.You are a girl who is turning 14 tomorrow. You've just discovered that your father is alive, after 10 years of living with your aunt Jessica.  There is a LOT of talking involved as you go through your tasks. You take a ship to Blood Edward Island, to meet your father. Of course he's not there to meet you, so you begin your adventure of exploring the island.In no time at all you've met ""D"", a ghost representation of a boy about your age. You two quickly decide you're soulmates, as both of you are looking to find your father and explore your memories.The puzzles are reasonably complex - the game is rated ""teen"" so this game wasn't meant for the little ones. They expect you to have at least a reasonable ability to remember clues and figure out puzzles. That being said, a lot of the puzzles are maddening because it's obvious what you have to do. It's just your CHARACTER that is completely clueless and doesn't get it. You have to click, click, click until she finally gets it. Sometimes you can't even pick up an object that you figure you'll need until you go somewhere else, see the ""destination object"", then trek back to the first object and pick it up then.Another issue I have is that some of the puzzles involve a lot of mindless screen rubbing. In one situation you have to clear a brass sign of rust. That means you have to sit there scrubbing your DS screen repeatedly until all of the rust comes off. There's enough wear and tear on a DS screen (and yes I do have a screen protector on it) to worry about the sensors wearing out, without actively doing something like this to it.Finally, there is a lot of random screen clicking that you have to do to even find things. You look at a sign and you SEE the pieces of it beneath the sign - but when you click on them it just says they are wooden pieces. You have to click in an exact spot to actually rearrange them. You look at a gate and it looks like a plain gate. You have to click on it further to see the lock mechanism.  It means you waste a lot of time randomly clicking all over just in case something is active. This girl should have better eyes than that.That all being said, I really do love puzzle games in general. The idea of a young teen girl trying to figure out who she is is rather cliche, but it gives her the chance to be both 'going out on her own' and 'nervous about being alone'. Having the ghost boy tag along is a nice touch - it's not too long ago that the main character would have ""of course"" been male, maybe with a helpless female sidekick.I'll give this a 3.5/5 for a fun concept and nice graphics, but a little too short and tedious.

The good (and there's a lot of it) almost entirely outweighs the bad, there's just one major malfunction that needs patching to make me keep playing this game after BF3 comes out.The single player is a decent close to the gears story line. Some of the supporting characters (Cole and Baird particularly) get a bit more developed in this title, and that's definitely a good thing. Cole is not just the one-liner spouting comic relief, and Baird is no longer the smart ass who just rides along with the rest of the team and their respective stories.The competitive multiplayer is still a shotgun fest. With the addition of the double barrel shotgun (or as some folks call it, the Double-BS) there is now even less incentive to try to use cover and manoeuvre to flank your opponents. The only viable sequence is Dive:double barrel:insta gib:dive away:reload (lather, rinse, repeat). In King of the Hill entire rounds will go with a combined forty or so kills, and approximately 35 of those kills are double barrel. In deathmatch and similar modes it's not so ridiculous, but the double barrel still rules the day.Beast is interesting, if you get a good group to play with. I played through it once, had fun for a few minutes, but don't think I'll be spending much time with it.Horde 2.0 is absolutely my favourite mode. It takes the previous wave defense mechanic and adds boss fights, challenge levels, and an in-game economy to buy fortifications and power weapons. This is where I spend most of my time online. It has only two huge flaws, both of which are correctable via a patch.1. No drop-in matchmaking. Once the party (of five) is matched up and the game launched there is no way for anyone else to drop in. This means, in turn, that when someone drops out you are permanently down a man. Once two people drop, it's pretty much impossible to continue. What's most odd about this is that Gears 2 was eventually patched to include a ""casual mode"" where people COULD drop in to a current match. Why Gears 3 shipped without this is a bit surprising.2. One particular boss, the Lambent Zerker, is really no fun to fight. It walks around the map, instantly destroying every fortification it touches. At the same time, it is completely invincible until it prepares to charge, thus exposing the glowing heart area. In effect, this means that when the Lambent Zerker is the boss, settle in and grab a soda because you're going to be at it for a loooooong time.Still can't hurt it. Still can't hurt it. Still can't hurt it. There goes another turret destroyed, but still can't hurt it. Still can't hurt it. Oh, it exposed the glowing spot, shoot it, shoot it! Well, back to waiting. Still can't hurt it. Still can't hurt it. Hey, look on the bright side, we only have to hit it another fifty times or so before it goes to stage two. And then we can do it all again until we get it to stage three. And then, finally, we can kill it.Most horde levels can be cleared in approximately three minutes. Boss waves might take five or so. Lambent Zerker boss waves typically take 15 minutes or more, at which time it becomes more a sense of ""oh, it's dead? About bloody time"". I don't expect a patch to eliminate the lambent zerker from horde, so I'll just keep doing what I've been doing... quitting the match and finding another as soon as the Lambent Zerker wave begins.I don't expect a patch to nerf the shotguns, as I suspect Epic is smart enough to realize the CoD crowd wants short range insta kills instead of tactics and manoeuvre (hellooooo, battlefield 3...).

I've read so much about the RPG aspect but haven't seen much.  I put about 12 hours in, and haven't made any ""crucial"" choices that seemed to affect any outcomes.  Unless they are saving the really tough choices for the 30 hour mark, I don't get the hype.  The renegade/good decisions that pop up with R2 and L2 are pretty stupid.  You don't know what the charactor is going to do until you've pressed the button, so you're always inclined to press it just to see what happens.  Hardly a crucial decision if you ask me.My other problem is the battle system.  In the early going, I was really enjoying each fire fight, and the enemies were getting progressively more difficult.  Then I hit a point where every fight felt the same, every planet felt the same, and every conversation felt the same.  Each mission involves shooting through a seemingly unending supply of enemies until you reach the end person you're meant to speak with, then they send you on yet another mission of shoot em up.Don't get me wrong, the enemy AI can be pretty good, and I died more than I'd care to admit.  The problem I have is the repetition of it all.  There is very little exploration of planets, and it's more of ""go where this arrow tells you to go.""  The weapons are cool, and your allies take care of business pretty well rather than the usual just get in the way type ally.  Overall, I was slightly disappointed based on the hype.  The graphics aren't anything to write home about either, but I can overlook that if the missions are more interesting.  Maybe the next installment will perfect the game, because it does have potential.",3,"It's good, but far from great",1296172800,"01 28, 2011"

I was very excited when it first arrived on the market and thought it would be fun having a new town and farm to play on a portable handheld. But unfortunately, this game turned out to be absolutely terrible and a huge miss that just gave more evidence that Harvest Moon has fallen way downhill since it's heyday on the Nintendo 64 and Playstation.First of all, the farming is basically torture. Not only do you have to build your own barns but they can fall down and all of your animals can die. You have to be kidding me. There is absolutely no way playing with this system could be fun. It is just stressful and too much work for a game that used to be so relaxing to play on a calm day. I did enjoy the addition of having a cat and dog and I thought the layout and look to the farm was nice. Really, it all does look nice graphically wise. Forever Not Valley looks rather cute and clear on the Nintendo DS and I liked all of the graphic sprites. But this does not take away that the town has no substance whatsoever. The characters are absolutely boring compared to previous titles and I have no urge to be friends with any of these people besides that they look cute. They are one dimensional and if they appear to have conflicts in the beginning of the game, they never come to surface or change. Yawn.As proof that characterization has gone down since the original games, I will compare this game to Harvest Moon 64 and Friends of Mineral Town. Lumina is my favorite girl in this game and Karen is my favorite in Friends of Mineral Town and 64.Nintendo 64 - KarenThe most memorable heart event was saving the vineyard after your effort! Karen comes over to your house to invite you over to see fairies kissing the fruit and begins to dance because she is just so overwhelmingly happy. It is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in a video game. Not to mention, Karen was full of depth. Her father was an abusive alcoholic, the family business was poor until you help, she longed to live in the city, etc.Friends of Mineral Town - KarenThe most memorable heart event was when Karen discovers that her father had bottles of wine stored for her as a baby. You must go to the neighbor's vineyard to help her carry them back home. When you get back she gives you a bottle as a gift. While is not nearly as special as the previous, I found it to be rather cute and unique! In this game Karen is not nearly as feisty but enjoys wine, is good talking with others, and is a romantic.Forget Me Not Valley - LuminaAll of her heart events consist of a DVD player. Yes. A DVD player. How romantic. She is nice and sometimes she likes to plays the piano.A Harvest Moon game with no characterization just takes about half the fun out of the game. This combined with the boring and long tedious farming system makes this game a waste!

You immediately can sense the irritating influences of trophy based game play in the single player and also online gaming.  Yes we can thank Microsoft for that horrible idea.  Am I the only person who thinks that trophy based game play is tedious and annoying?  I think I must be because it seems to so prevalent.  On the other hand reality TV is also very common, and asinine so perhaps we're just following the trend here.I'm not sure how Rock Star managed to screw up the big parts of this game up so badly.  2K games just demonstrated how incredibly fun multi-player gaming is done with Borderlands, but instead of taking a page from their book Rock Star has created a crappy Free Roam version of the single play area.  So instead of a seamless experience where I can just invite my friends to quest with me, I get a bag on the side unlock annoyfest.  Seriously, the single player stuff should have been unlocking cool stuff for online play all along.  Rock Star, you fail.I must stress that he graphics really are incredibly well done, and the writers of this game were talented, but with little room for humor.

As you spend the entire game in Shanghai the only variation you get from fighting in alleys and streets is the Zoo level and the wacky inclined/toppled building level which is rather short.  The game is fun as its more of the same. Weapon customization can be a pain as they seemed to have spent more time creating a customization system rather than developing the ""moral decisions"" you make.  Its a poorly executed story element of the game as there is little impact to the story other than brief comic book type shorts after you decide what to do that don't really have anything to do with the story.  Whereas in the first game you had a definite story with plot twists and characters this game seems to lack in that respect.  Granted your only real mission in this game is to ""get out of Shanghai"" I felt like there needed to be more of a driving force to this game in terms of story rather than a poor experiment in morality. If you want a game that revolves around choices play a game from the Fable series.I haven't played the multiplayer as there are better games for that (Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, Battlefield Bad Company 2 are examples) so I can't comment on whether or not the game makes up for its shortcomings in that respect. The game is fun if you have a friend to play through with as there are very few games that are designed with a partner in mind.I can't recommend buying this game for $60 as it doesn't really take a step forward over the prequel, in fact I feel like its a step back in terms of story (the radio logs you collect throughout the game are supposed to flesh out what is happening and why, but they do little to help. A couple radio logs are in chinese and another is just some woman screaming for a second). I've played this game through twice and I still don't really have a firm grasp of why the antagonist attacked Shanghai.If you're a fan of the first game I'd say play this one, buy it for less than full price though otherwise you'll feel like you overpaid. If you haven't played the first Army of Two and enjoy co-op games, go and get that first and keep yourself occupied with that until the price drops on this game. I'd say $40 is fair and anything less is a good deal although if you can't wait to play it or don't have any other options, pick this game up. As far as co-op goes, this game is probably one of the better games to play outside of the first Army of Two or the Halo series.",3,An experiment in morality that fails,1270339200,"04 4, 2010"

I choose to write this review because basically 14 is the last edition of the game and it's no different from this version.I love college football, and the Heisman mode alone is well worth the purchase. Unfortunately, EA sports has relied for far too long on brand name and appeal. The rating for this game is much more dependent upon my love of college football and the excitement of the sport than anything else.The physics and the programming of EA is more and more arcade like every rendition of the game. What makes me upset about these titles is that the trajectory of balls (chuckle) as well as the engagement of players change to the whim of the CPU. Most dedicated gamers can learn the ins and outs of the system, but they shouldn't have to.If you're engaged then you shouldn't slide/fly to the ball carrier based on proximity. You could be running straight away and if you pass an engaged defender he'll glue to you.- The ball trajectory is insane as well, if it's heading one way it will literally auto track to another player without any rhyme or reason. Another lazy glue tactic to allow for the catching motions which are the prized features of the franchise for some reason.While the death of NCAA football game is already given, and somewhat upsetting, I'm hoping that maybe more companies can get involved. Monopoly inspires little creativity, and for a long time dedicated player it's annoying. They essentially just keep updating the rosters and port every other feature of the game, and add or bring back some other fan favorite gimmick and a spit shine and scream &#34;are you happy now.&#34;",4,NCAA Fan,1388534400,"01 1, 2014"

6150,156889,A1N4PW6FTMBUSQ,B003O6E67A,Slashaholic Anonymous,"[4, 5]","Simply put, Resistance 3 (R3) rocks. I've liked both Resistance: Fall of Man and Resistance 2, though they both offered drastically different gameplay experiences. To me, the ""magic"" of Resistance lies in its campaign, and R3 offers the best campaign experience in the series, hands down.There is never a dull moment as you play through Joseph Capelli's quest to finally rid the ever-freezing earth of the Chimera. Capelli, though a soft-spoken family man who's motivation comes out of his desire to protect his wife and baby boy, and save the remnants of humanity. The Resistance campaigns have always included a variety of environments and locations, and Resistance 3 continues this tradition. From dusty towns to underground mines to converted prisons to a frozen New York tundra, the landscape never gets too monotonous. And neither does the action. Each location demands a different approach, different tactics to overcome the hordes of Chimera and other unsavory characters that you'll be faced with. Fortunately the handy weapon wheel from Resistance 1 makes a return, allowing you to carry every weapon you've picked up at the same time. This might sound ""old school"", but with great firepower comes great responsibility, and R3 leaves it up to the player to decide which weapon is best for any given situation.Also, run-and-gunners: Be ye warned! R3 is not Call of Duty or Killzone; your health does not regenerate if you hide behind cover. Health packs are plentiful enough to keep the careful player going, but don't expect to charge into battle in the fashion of Pickett's Charge and get very far.I'm pleased to say that R3 offers campaign cooperative play, both split-screen and online, and a friend and I have already played a good portion of R3 together. The large day-1 patch that you'll have the pleasure of downloading makes co-op a much better experience with a multitude of minor tweaks that really do help.The multiplayer is, in my opinion, a mixed bag that mostly depends on your taste and preference. Again, R3 is not Call of Duty or Battlefield; the best comparison would honestly be Killzone 3 or Halo: Reach, in that players can take a fair amount of damage before they go down. R3 will require another patch or two to get things moving as smoothly as they should be, but in the meantime, it's still worth checking out. Sadly, the 8-player coop that many considered the only redeeming quality of Resistance 2 is not in R3. There are various game modes, including your standard team deathmatch and various objective game modes; there is also classic hardcore mode, which gets rids of berserk powers and other abilities and leaves you just guns and grenades.In conclusion, Resistance 3 is a superb addition to the Resistance series. I can't emphasize enough how engaging, interesting, and entertaining the campaign is. There aren't many campaigns that I turn around and start playing again as soon as I finish them, but I'm adding R3 to that list. Multiplayer, though in need of a patch or two to get everything smoothed out, is nonetheless solid and entertaining, and the unique nature of the guns, berserk abilities, and other abilities does make this a unique online experience. If you're a fan of the Resistance series, or if you're a fan of FPS games in general, then this is definitely a must-buy for PS3 owners.",4,Best in series? Easily.,1315785600,"09 12, 2011"

I can't say that this is a bad game, but it's far from good. Everything has been slightly improved over last year's edition and overall the game is more fun to play. If you are purchasing this for the online racing, good luck to you - the online play can be very glitchy. The offline racing is fun to a degree, but I found myself getting bored after a season. The career mode is a nice touch (something that Nascar: The Game 2011 should have had) but it seems like it was thrown together in a slapdash way. I was not expecting the franchise modes of MLB: The Show, but I was expecting a bit more from Eutechnyx here. Ultimately, I resold this game after a few months of playing it. Shortly after reselling it, I found my old copy of Nascar Racing 2002 Season, made by Papyrus (I wish I had purchased Papyrus's final installment (2003) but I didn't and there's no way I'm paying over $100 for a used copy of it now). I know some people will say that comparing PC games to console games is like comparing apples to oranges, but the part that bothers me most about Nascar: The Game Inside Line is that a PC game made more than a decade ago is more entertaining than the Nascar games that are being produced today.

Now, Manhunt 2 is finally here and carrying a Mature rating instead, but don't think that this game has been watered down a whole lot.  If you played the original Manhunt, you'll feel right at home here as you play as escaped inmate Danny, who is on a mission to seek the truth.  However, as the title of the game implies, you've got some trouble approaching on your tail in the form of hunters, who are looking to do some harm to you, which is saying it quite lightly.  As with the first game, stealth is the name of the game, and it requires quite a bit of skill that proves pretty rewarding once you get the hang of it.  The execution moves serve up ample amounts of blood and guts as well, even though a blurring effect has been added to the most violent scenes of the game. Manhunt 2 isn't without it's flaws though, including the fact that the game isn't really all that suspenseful compared to the first game.  The atmosphere remains eerie, but it just feels like there's something missing here.  The music and sound effects are well done, but the graphics engine looks incredibly dated. Gameplay wise, the stealth tricks work wonderfully, but the gunplay elements are rather disappointing in terms of style.

I bet most people see this in the stores and think it looks generic by the cover art. I'm sure the bargain price doesn't help that either but anyone who does pass it over is really missing out.The Plot: The earth is being attacked by aliens(when are we not?)and the Earth Defense Force is mankinds only hope for survival. Simple.The Hook: There are quite a few different types of monsters ranging from giant insects to giant robots and even more gigantic mechanical walkers and ships. There are also a ton of weapons to aquire and power up to deal maximum damage.The Challenge: 53 levels of pure insanity that punish the player by increasing enemies and difficulty. Speaking of which, there are 4 levels of difficulty that'll truly test your skill.The Payoff: Every level has swarms of enemies and when each is destroyed, drop armor level power ups, new weapons (the higher difficulty, the better), and health. There are also vehicles strewn about the stages ( Tank, Helicopter, Mech, and motor bike). I wish they were a little easier to control, but they work enough to work and are a nice change of pace.The Controls: They work very well when your on foot but as I said, the vehicles could really use some fine tuning. For example, you have to hold down a face button to keep the helicopter up, and use another face button to shoot. Most every other game has solved this by using the analog sticks. The tank, mech and bike are all a little awkward to drive too. Even if they could've allowed you customize them would help some. I wish they worked like they should but oh well.The Visuals: They don't rank up there with the best of the next gen crop  but the art style is really nice. The larger monsters and ships are also impressive, so they're definitely not last gen graphics. Some of the animations are a little jerky and the landscapes can be a little bland but it's not a big deal as you'll be too busy blasting away. There are also some massive explosions that are truly a sight to behold. You can destroy pretty much everything including the city buildings and freeway overpasses, which all come crumbling down. The end boss fight is truly a sight to behold. But what truly sells this game here is the scale. Many monster games give you that level or top down camera which makes everything look small. Here, the camera is on the ground, so you really get the effect of these giants stomping down the street and coming after you. It's a really great perspective that I wish was used more in games like these.The Audio: Again, not up there with the top of the heap but satifying. Theres an epic Godzilla score that's doom and gloom. The machine gun fire and rockets all sound good. It's actually pretty loud and chaotic when so many things are going on at the same time. Your fellow solidiers make some funny comments and cheer each other on along the way. The sound works fine.The Recommendation: I had and continue to have alot of fun with this game. It's a real pick up and play type arcade shooter with all the challenge you could want. Earth Defense Force is a hybrid mix of Godzilla, Independence Day, Starship Troopers, War of the Worlds and Serious Sam. If you like any of those, you'll definitely like this game.

2189,129964,A30IP5D5DLHRPA,B002BSA20M,Kyle Slayzar,"[9, 13]","Anyone who has read Eric Nylund's novel ""Halo: The Fall of Reach,"" or actually listened to the in game dialog from Halo: Combat Evolved knows the fate of the planet Reach as well as all of the Spartans save for Master Chief.  If anything, the advertising campaign of Halo: Reach makes the game out to be a memorial to those who were lost in the fictional world of Halo with the moniker ""Remember Reach.""It is truly ironic that Bungie would decide to end the Halo franchise by going back to the beginning, just before the events of Halo: Combat Evolved.However, with this in mind Halo fans, like myself, felt compelled to see the story end and begin anew similar to watching the end of Episode III of the Star Wars saga.  We know Reach fell and that Master Chief was the last of the Spartans hinting that all others perished, but fans want to know who the past Spartans were and how they met their end.  Halo Reach provides such closure by showing the Halo universe, more specifically humanity's war with the Covenant, in the most gritty and desperate way possible.First, the story.  Halo fans have been somewhat cheated in recent years with the unanswered questions generated at the end of Halo 3, an almost campy story from Halo: ODST, and the completely unrelated one from Halo Wars.  While both games had their strong points, and believe me I still play ODST with my buds online, their stories proved very lacking in the end.Reach redeems the franchise with a gritty portrayal of a desperate battle in an even more desperate war.  The player follows the not-so-silent protagonist Noble 6, the newest addition to Noble Team, a group of Spartans tasked to investigating and later defending the planetary hub of Reach.  Each mission getting more and more desperate than the last as the team struggles to survive knowing full well that they are losing the war and death is getting ever so closer.  Imagine WWII in space, the Allies are losing, and the Nazis want to kill everyone and I do mean everyone in the name of a psychotic belief; THAT is how desperate humanity is just at the beginning of the game.  The extinction of humanity is a very possible outcome should Reach fall.With this in mind I can safely say that I was generally moved by the flow of the story.  It was not complicated, boring, overly-emotional, or just downright campy.  It was tough, gritty, and downright nasty, but compelling at the same time.The characters themselves were unique and easy to get along with without getting into the traditional racial and cultural stereotypes that typically accompany military-style games.  While Noble Team is diverse in race, gender, and culture, there are no clear stereotypes, which has really been a big nuisance in recent games such as Final Fantasy 13.To amplify the story and atmosphere the player is treated to beautiful visuals as well as wonderfully composed music that doesn't seem out of place.  If I can credit ODST for one thing it was well-placed music that helped move the story along.  Halo composer Martin O'Donnell certainly has come of age since he made the interesting compilation of Halo: Combat Evolved almost 10 years ago.  The music isn't exotic and abstract but, like the story, gritty and mean.  Select guitar riffs combined with O'Donnell's love for African drums really intensifies the player's attitude to something akin to, ""I'm gonna kill all of you"" when you assault nearby Covenant forces.The visuals are very stunning.  In one of the earlier missions when I was dangling my feet out of a VTOL craft, bored out of my mind while waiting to be inserted in a very hot landing zone, my buddy Tom told me to look out over the horizon and ""enjoy the view.""  I panned the camera upwards to be treated to a very beautiful landscape of grasslands and forests.  The more I took the time to admire the landscapes the more I realized just hot well it looked.  To make it more realistic, the landscape becomes more charred at the battle goes on from a lush world to something the resembled photos I've seen of battle-sites from World War 1.As for other visuals the character and weapons details are astonishing.  The weapons no longer look like smooth plastic toys but something you can beat a Brute to death should you run out of ammo.  The character graphics were not as impressive, but still better than most FPS games that have been cranked out in recent years (Save for Modern Warfare 2).  My only beef with the graphics is that there is so much going on that it causes the frame rate to seriously slow down.  Limitations of the XBox360, there are greater tragedies in life such as Justin Bieber and Alpha Protocol.The game play itself is very smooth and surprisingly well balanced.  It took me some time to get used to the new controller scheme (right bumper is melee and not reload like in Halo 3 and ODST) although this is fairly adjustable.  Unlike other Halo releases, players cannot simply skate through Legendary, the hardest difficulty setting, by having a 4-player online co-op as done so in Halo 3 and ODST.  Surprisingly, Reach has the hardest campaign I've played to date and actually adjusts for difficulty if co-op is used.  I do not know if the game utilizes an AI Director, but it sure seems that way at times.One vast improvement to enemy AI is their ability to utilize your own vehicles against you.  It caught my by surprise when I was trying to retrieve my warthog to find myself being shot at by it.  It took me two seconds to realize that elites LOVE to steal cars and pummel you to death with them.  Next time I'll use The Club.One of the things I liked best about Reach is the complete customization of your own character.  In previous Halo games, you can only adjust color and maybe a few other details but such changes are only available in multiplayer.  In Reach not only can you customize EVERYTHING from helmets to knee pads to voice, but it is shown in campaign mode and even in cut scenes.  When I first started a campaign and noticed Noble 5 in the cut scenes was wearing an ODST helmet with a crimson on gray color scheme I'd picked out when I first booted up I knew that Bungie had done something REALLY right.Another one of my favorites is Firefight.  In a word; perfected.  In ODST firefight was a novel idea but only good for gaining achievements and gamer score in the end since it was overly repetitive and lacked any real customization.  In Reach you can choose everything from rounds to kind of shields used.  Hell, we had a blast for over an hour by enabling infinite ammo, shields and seeing who could get the 10-kill combo or ""Killionare"" achievement first... I lost.From what we fidgeted around with in Forge, the map creator, it seems as though Bungie fixed most of the problems that plagued Halo 3 and ODST.  It is easier to place objects and have a LOT more control over features.  This is good given a good percentage of the 12 maps are classic Halo maps or remakes.  While I'm not a true fan of user made content, I think this is a step in the right direction.Lastly is online play.  I'm not a true fan of online multiplayer since I don't have as much time to practice as your average hardcore gamer.  What I did like was the matchmaking ability that allows you to find online co-op games with certain difficulties similar to what designers did in Left 4 Dead 2.  What really impressed me, however, is how the servers did not spaz out even when I had a 4-player co-op going with people from around the US and on opening night no less.  Kudos.All in all, Reach is an excellent game, a truly good way to end the franchise... assuming they will.  Halo Fans will be delighted while casual gamers may find the ideal FPS game albeit with a little more difficulty than they're used to.All in all, a 9.5/10.  Solid A!

A nice variety of WWII weapons are present, and they are fairly easy to aim and use. There are also quite a few levels that are really large in size, which is very surprising for the Game Boy Advance. Also, the game is better than Doom, as it is more realistic and the enemies are much easier to see. Unfortanutley, it is just too damn dark. The Game Boy Advance is not backlit, and this just reminds of that. It is also a port of the Playstation game. Medal of Honor: Underground lacks the polish of the original and the new additions found in the Playstation 2 game, Medal of Honor Frontline. Environments are bland, and enimies can sometimes be too tough. There is never enough ammunition, either. However, this game is eaisly the best first-person shooter to grace the Game Boy Advance.

I think by the end of the year, we'll be looking at a really fine game.Unfortunately, the servers we are REQUIRED to connect to in order to play what is supposed to be a SINGLE-PLAYER GAME have had about 40% uptime.I think the notion of regions and cooperative play with other players is groundbreaking.  Properly executed, this could have been a major evolutionary--no, REVOLUTIONARY--new iteration of the SimCity franchise.  As things stand now, it's a monumental foul-up.I'm not prepared to go so far as to say I'll never get an EA game again, but you can bet your bottom dollar I won't be PRE-ordering an EA title ever again.  That train has now officially left the station.  I'll treat EA products like Microsoft operating systems: I'll wait until at least SP1, if not SP2, before I take the plunge and buy.As for EA nickle-and-diming us to death with DLC, that remains to be seen.  But I'll tell you something: I think they OWE us at least $20 in free DLC as a simple customer relations move once they get things stabilized.  I'm not going to jump on the ""EA SUXXOR!!"" bandwagon, but in all fairness, they've got some tall apologizing to do for this debacle.And let us build bigger cities already.

In some areas it succeeds, but in most it fails. This game had no affiliation with Sid Meier, creator of CivI and II (the latter arguably the best pc strategy game ever).Pros:Good government selection. Some new governments are included, like Fascism, Technocracy, Theocracy, Ecology, Corporate Republic, etc.Armies and Fleets. In CivII a stack of units could be killed in what attack. This is not so.Automated Improvements. The government automatically does terrain improvements.Diplomacy and Trade: Both are well planned and fairly extensive.Cons:Diplomacy and Trade: Neither are used to their full extent, and if you try, other civilizations refuse. There's all types of stuff, like trade embargoes, etc, but the AI never does them.Civilizations: Over 30 Civs to choose from, but there's really no difference in between them. Also, whenever I play, I'm always up against the same Civs: French, British, German, Irish, Scottish, American, and Native Americans. That gets boring very fast.Slow: The interface is slow, even on a 128MB Ram P3 500mhz machine.Scenarios: Only 4 of them, and none are any good.NO CUSTOMIZATION OF UNITS OR CIVS: In Civ2 anyone could make their own units, terrains, technologies, scenarios, maps, etc. You can't do any of this in CTP2.Conclusion: Civ3 should be out in the US within 2 months, it's coming to Mac, and to Europe. Civ3 has Sid Meier working on it. Civ3 has elaborate diplomacy and trade. Civ3 has culture points, great military leaders, many unit animations, civ specific units, new paths to victory, total customization of units, civs, techs, maps, etc, has better graphics, more realistic, more units, will ship with 12 scenarios, and so much more.

I yelled at my friends how they owe me 60 bucks and I vowed to never buy a halo game ever again ( except for the halo combat evolved remake). Then this game halo reach came out. Like clock work my buddies begged me to get it. They say "" dude!!! You'll like it this time this one is awesome diuuuuddde!"" I said you'd better be right. I turned to my wife and said I'm off to game stop. Played it,turned it off 2 hrs later, scalded myself and told my boyz I'll never play a new halo ever. Halo 4 has since come out.y friends begged me saying the same thing"" this ones different I swear! The graphics are awesome!"" I held my ground and haven't regretted it at all.Why this big back story? Because the halo franchise is a mediocre franchise. Much like the madden franchise. People clearly play it for just multiplayer dm. The story is a generic flop for every game since. Your a spartan. You hunt aliens, you find aliens, you blow up aliens, a bunch of crappy AI marines die, you drive a car, you drive a banshee, you blow up aliens. This happens the same way in almost every halo game.

Yeah I had fun driving a warthog around while my buddy shoots the rocket launcher but, I can do that in the first game. Halo needs to expand to keep hardcore gamers like me interested. More focus on campaigns and coop. They need to expand the universe from a linear fps to to a more involved third person rpg/action shooter....they could call it mass effect lol I'm just kidding. But I'd welcome a rival to mass effect.All I'm saying is literally if you've played any halo game you've played them all. I won't ever buy halo 4 but if bungie makes a halo space drama/third person /turn based/ action platformer strategy game. I will look into it.Halo reach is halo 1 but with more guns and a multiple Spartans. They're not likeable characters and they each have generic personas.

X-Men had it's official game, and even The Da Vinci Code got a video game.  Usually when this happens, the game tends to be mediocre.  A waste of the license.  Other times it's a cash in for the franchise.  Then, of course, there's the fact that the developers of these games, for some reason, never give it their all.  Cars is another video game tie in to the movie, yet for all it's worth, this is one that's actually pretty good.  It still suffers from some of the ""movie gone video-game"" trends such as bugs in the game, which usually comes because the game is rushed out to meet the release date of the film.  Still, for what it's worth, Cars manages to be a good game after all.The game actually takes place after the movie, something that doesn't normally happen when a video-game tie-in is done.  Still, it's pretty nice.  The good news is you needn't see the film in order to play the game.  You don't even have to have heard of the film.  The game is all about the racing.  Lightning is gearing up to beat his rival Chick Hicks.  That's all there is to it.The gameplay at first carries out much like Grand Theft Auto.  You get to roam around Radiator Springs, doing missions.  Most of them consist of racing, and the racing actually isn't so bad. However, also like Grand Theft Auto, you've got to complete a set of missions before another set becomes availible.  You'll also, of course, be able to free-roam.Racing makes up the bulk of the game.  It's no Gran Turismo 4, but it is, for the most part, a lot of fun.  Your objective is to simply win, of course, and there are pit stops along the way, which you'll have to work fast to get yourself back out there, or risk losing your position.  It's pretty much like playing a racing game.  You can powerslide and boost, although you won't really need it during the races themselves and they can be a pain to control sometimes.  Racing is easy.  The games races are disturbingly easy at first sight.  The AI of your opponents is predictable, and there were even cases where my opponents actually slowed down to give me a boost.  So it's not by any means a challening game.  It gets harder, but not to the point where you'll find yourself losing races.  By the time it actually feels competative, the game is over.There are also mini-games here.  A lot of the time when games do this they feel tacked on.  Not here.  Not only are some games neccesary to progress further, but they're actually fun.  The mini-games presented are for more than just wasting time.  There's more of a point to them than in your average game.  The pitstop game, for example, is a mini-game where you have to get your car back on the road in the fastest time possible.The game also has two difficulty levels.  The standard and one that's easier for kids.  The standard is already easy enough, but the kids version is even easier.  As you might expect, the easier difficulty is kid-friendly.  Even your child might want to skip over playing the game in this mode.  There aren't as many missions, and the already easy races are easier.Cars is a game that looks fantastic.  All the models look almost exactly like they do in the film.  They're vibrant and detailed the way you expect them to be.  The game just looks great.  There are bugs, however.  Such as you being able to get stuck in the environment and so you'll find yourself having to wait for the game to reset you back to where you want to be.  These glitches are, thank goodness, few and far between.  Most of the time you'll be able to get yourself out.As far as a game based off a movie goes, Cars makes the best use of its voice cast.  All the stars who supplied their voices in the film are here, and they do a fantastic job with their respective rolls.  This is an all star cast and it works.  Those who saw the film and enjoyed it, will absolutely love the voice work in this game.  The audio itself is also really good.  Big name music artists supply the majority of the audio.This is one of the better video-game tie ins.  The gameplay is sharp, and it sounds and looks good.  It suffers a little from bugs, but not so much that it takes away from the gameplay.  It's by no means a hard game, and it isn't long either, but while the gameplay lasts, it's fantastic.The Good+Great looking game+All Star voice actors+Free-roam style gameplay+Racing is fun+A good mess of mini gamesThe Bad-There are a couple of bugs-The game is far too easy for your average gamer",4,Right on Track,1150848000,"06 21, 2006"

Nicholson,"[5, 8]","Another great racing Sim from Bugbear/Empire games!As with the original FlatOut this is another high quality racing game that pits you against 7 other, hell-bent on winning, computer drivers. The game is also playable on the Internet against real opponents.The Pros:1.)The races are over a variety of terrain; there are  race tracks, country roads, desert wastelands and towns.3.)The physics, as with the original game, are hard to believe! Sliding around corners, braking, crashes are very realistic.4.)Initially you only get to a limited number of tracks (and cars) to chose from until you finish at least in the top 3 places in a race, at which point new areas to race are opened up for you to try. You can use your winnings to upgrade your existing car or even buy a better vehicle if you have the funds. This is a great feature as it gives you incentive to finish high in the standings.5.)There are an assortment of bonus games and stunts that become available as you proceed through this game. These are fun but not the adrenalin pumping action of the real game.6.)The rag doll effect (driver flying through the windshield after an accident) is stopped immediately (thankfully) once the reset button is pressed.The Cons:1.)Although there are lots of racing venues, there seemed to be a lot of repetition of the race tracks that are used; every new racing area opened up, seemed to use the same tracks  (with some slight variations) you'd finish is the last competition.2.)There as no info booklet or game sheet with the game (just the 5 discs); the manual is on the disc itself. Anyone playing FlatOut for the first time would be hard pressed to figure out the controls and especially to play in the first person perspective (and really the only way to play this race is from the drivers seat looking out the windshield) instead of 3rd person (from above and behind the car) which is the default.3.)Finally, my most serious complaint with this addition to the Flatout series is the lack of car damage (that effects drivability). With the original Flatout there was a ""Pro"" mode that allowed car damage to really affect performance; this is not the case with Flatout 2. If I had to name one major distraction from this game it would have to be that the major emphasis is on destroying objects and wrecking other drivers,(which were prominent in the original but not to the same degree) instead of skillful driving. And it's a shame really, because the AI of the computer drivers in really good and when combined with tract difficulty, makes winning a race against them a real challenge. I just think they went the wrong direction in this game and as a result I didn't enjoy this game quiet as much as the  original.Suggestions:1.) To be competitive you really need a steering wheel with a gas/brake pedal feature.2.) Power and speed are important but so are handling and braking; so spend money on stabilizers, tires and shocks as well as the ""power items"".3.) Take some time at the beginning to set up the game to make it work right; go to the ""Options"" menu, set it to your likings (especially the ""camera"" setting which will allow you to set up a key on the keyboard so you can toggle through the different views to get the first person perspective) and you'll be rewarded with great driving competition.All in all, as good a racing Sim as I could ask for (with some minor reservations mentioned above). If you liked the original game, I'm sure you enjoy this one as well. 4-4  Stars.",4,"Almost,  but  not quite , as good as the original FlatOut",1157155200,"09 2, 2006"

The Playstation 2 version of the game itself is stripped down to the minimum acceptable level.

Later on I ended up getting a PS3 and Rock Band was amongst my first titles I bought for it. I instantly felt like I'd made the right choice.Something to note:All the peripherals inside the PS2 Special Edition are completely identical to the PS3 Special Edition, with the exception that the PS2 version includes a 4-port USB Hub, which is particularly nice should you need the ports on say a 40gb PS3 in the future (as the system only has 2 available USB ports) or for your general computer needs.To date, I've expanded the basic 58 songlist up to 96, and soon to reach 100+.

I was very excited to play this, because I have been in a search of a decent RPG game since I went overtime with Oblivion, but this game sucks!Dragon Age depresses me greatly. Everytime I tried to play this, I exited the game feeling like I wasted my time in the worst way possible.The combat is emphesized to be TACTICAL. All that really means is, I found out, you can pause anytime and order commands then unpause. Where is the fun in this? I would hate to waste my time playing a video game that requires no skill and delivers me no sense of urgency when there are other video games that challenge me in one way or another. I genuinely appreciate good game designs when I see them, but I found no aspect in this game that 'wow'ed me because everything about this game is so plain and linear. Either way, since combat is such a big part of the game, it would take a miracle for this game to be 'decent' at this point, but as you will see, that is not the case.I cannot comment much on the story since I did not get very far in the game before I completely gave up. But the beginning story of the human noble I made (there are 6 different beginning stories that lead to the same story eventually) was very uninspired and was presented poorly. The demons are said to be coming back, and then a legendary Warden who hunts these demons comes in town, asks for your assistance, and the same day your father gets murdered by a betrayal of a friend that is linked with these demons. You be the judge of this...The way the dialogue is played out, with you choosing from a number of response options to respond to what other characters say to you, becomes really tedious very quickly. I watched some trailer and it looked good, but was I wrong again... Most dialogue options you are given do not affect the outcome, but they may trigger a different verbal response from your target. That is about it... The dialogue options are boring and dull and I felt helpless that it takes so much time for the game to get going because of all the useless chat you have to do when you don't care about the history of a poorly built fictional world or the name of the warrior who saved the same fictional world a hundred years ago.I read other reviews and am shocked that some people praise this tedious game by saying it is intellectual or tactical. I disagree. A lot of games today are tactical, but they're also fast-paced and require other skills (which I call video game skills), so the tactics involved in the process are not as obvious as this one's. Tactics found in this game are very shallow anyway. You pause when you get in a battle, you aim a faraway enemy with your archer, you use a spell or a skill when necessary, and you focus one unit at a time. You have unlimited time to tinker with these options...which makes this game even less rewarding as it is.Bioware should fire the team who made this because I'm sure it's the same team that made Never Winter Nights, which is also a boring game. Try Mass Effect instead. That is a much better game made by Bioware.",3,Tedious,1257724800,"11 9, 2009"

It has been a surprise, but music games are everywhere on the next generation consoles. That has also been proven with the success of Guitar Hero. Since it came out over a year ago originally for the Playstation 2, many gamers have wanted a piece to rock out with. The sequel also scored big with gamers, but now it isn't a only Sony game anymore. With Activision bringing all the hype to the Xbox 360. The bigger question now is will more be welcomed here than it had on the PS2?Guitar Hero for the Xbox 360 brings out the animal in any Xbox 360 owner who has ambitions to be like their rock heroes. The gameplay follows suit like it did with the Playstation 2 edition, as you strum your guitar through over 50 classic rock songs including guilty pleasures like Rock This Town by the Stray Cats, Message In A Bottle by the Police, Guns N' Roses 80's smash Sweet Child Of Mine, and Heart's Crazy On You. What seperates this one nicely though is that you can actually download songs from Xbox live and use those songs on this game as well to add to the fun. The gameplay though mainly is the same as the PS2 version, but the control is a bit easier to maintain with a improved guitar grip. The only disadvantage is that it costs much more than the PS2 bundle by about $20, which leaves some Xbox 360 fans waiting for a price drop.All in all, Guitar Hero II works very nicely for anybody who owns a Xbox 360, and handles as a great party game. If you however own both a PS2 and a 360, you would be probably be better off with PS2 edition because it is cheaper. Still, this is a great game that is fun and challenging to play that any Xbox 360 owner would love to have in their library.

Very basic FPS with decent weapons, easy controls and fast action.  The zombies are very ""28 Days Later"" nouveau fast running and the action looks great.  The game takes you and three others on a run for safety through a variety of locations:  skyscraper, sewers, jungle, etc, and keeps throwing enough zombie action, along with taking care of your fellow team members and gearing up, to give you a nice ride.  The negative in this game is that it is very fast and once you get through it a couple of times, it becomes repetitious, as it doesn't really change much.  Again, this is from only solo game play.

Its more like an arcade sandbox game without the quarters.  I managed to beat the game in 3 days, thankfully it was only rented so be wary of purchasing it.What it boils down to...Nothing in it is too hard to do.  You spend most of the game hunting down generals of this kingpin boss (three kingpin bosses all together).  To kill a general you only have to leap and run past the gambit of henchmen, blow the general up with a few rockets and finish him off with the biggest machine gun you got while he's burning on the ground.  Then sweep the area of any henchmen thats left because thats about the only way you'll get your super powers buffed.  If you try to take on the hench men then the general you'll get frustrated because they constantly respawn and thus waste your time.  I had no problem at all maxing out all my skills in the 3 days I played and became this unstoppable force.  It almost felt like I had a cheat loaded because none of the accomplishments felt like you truly earned them.  I found the stronger you got in one field the easier it was to buff that field until full.  The city is full of globes to collect.  Some trickier then others.  Its what you do when you don't want to fight bad guys and after you finish the game for accomplishment points.The rides...The vehicles in the game are pathetic.  Not one drives any good even the special super agent cars.  They all feel floaty and loose on the road and can't make a turn without overshooting killing cilivians and penalizing you.  I spent most of the game avoiding vehicles all together unless to toss around (the old pig skin lol).  This is the worst driving sandbox game yet except for True Crime: Streets of LA.  Its a cool factor that your agent cars upgrade with you albiet a little wierd to watch (why couldn't the agency just give you that 'special' car to begin with).  Jumping on a car from way up high is fun, it also shows that car's bleed like you squished a bug.  Its too bad the cars don't totally crush in like that agent does on Matrix: Reloaded.  That would have been a major plus.The dude...Ok your a super hero, you can't be a bad guy and you don't have any interaction with the guy's looks except during your initial character 'pick' in the beginning.  He will morph slightly during your upgrades into a better looking character.  I'd say about 95% of the time he will jump and do exactly as you want but there is that lingering percentage where he absolutely refuses to cooperate.  I do not get the feeling of Prince of Persia's unbeatable sync with the character on screen.  In fact he handles more like Alex Denton from Deus Ex, as great as that game was, the character was like driving a tank.  In your head is this special announcer guy thats always repeating the same stuff telling you tips and hints about crap that newbs would know.  Only very rarely does he come out with anything interesting to say or appropiate subject matter for what your doing.  However, in the disimbodied guys defense, you get lonely without him after turning him off in the menu.The gangs...Pathetic, pathetic, pathetic, I've seen rocket launching grandmas pack more punch then these after school special rejects.  Okay maybe they aren't that bad.  I hate the fact they respawn, its uber annoying, especially when they just 'materialize' right before your eyes.  If you know a building is empty then why oh why do they keep coming up elevators from unknown paths (some of the elevators have nothing above or below them).  They say the same things over and over and over again which makes you want to kill each and every one.  They don't seem to have any team connections so instead of flanking you, they run around hoping to get a bead on your cyber head disregarding the guy next to them that just got turned into a stain.  Then after they see you theres that inevitable delay, they might as well sing ""waiting to be killed...waiting to be killed"".  On the road they get plain annoying as your walking around with gang notority.  They'll pull up in these distinctive POS's and one or two will pop out.  Simply walk up to them, pop them with the [...] of your gun and shoot them while they float in the air to get both strenght and accuracy buffs.  Eventually your strength will be enough where you hit one, it will kill the subsequent others behind him, lol.Its a small world after all...The demo shows pretty much all you get.  The Cuervos region is 33% of what you get.  Thats not much in comparison to Saint's Row.  They added a cell shaded look to the game for some odd reason making it feel cartoony instead of gritty and real.  The big black lines around stuff is distracting.  I can say that objects you tear up and people you kill will stay put for a while and thats a plus.  I heard they did it to buff the draw-in distance and allow for more poly without slowdown unlike the occasional one in Saint's.  It is awesome that I can see well into the distance other parts of Pacific City.  There are problems with graphics.  Several times I've witnessed people driving invisible cars. You can actually hit these people as if they are really there and not protected.  It looks so strange.

I could have spent my money on something much better than this string of snapshots with voiceovers attatched.  If this game were freeware, I probably would have liked it, but it's not.  Instead, it's a twenty dollar game that plays like freeware and has packaging like Myst.Incidentally, it was the references to Myst on the packaging that led me to buy this game.  The packaging says, &quot;Think Myst but in a real location&quot; (Quandary).  True, like this game, Myst was basically snapshots of a fictional world that you could occaisionally interact with, much like this game, but there's a few big differences between Myst and this game.  Myst never really felt like a string of snapshots to me, because the world it depicted was so beautiful and mysterious, and the puzzles were so engaging.  Capri is beautiful, but moving through it is confusing and frusterating.  There are so many places where one street looks just like another, which makes getting turned around or lost really easy, unless you check the map every step of the way, and doing that just makes the game feel even more clunky.  I enjoyed the scenery in Myst, but I could care less about the many, many snapshots of streets that A Quiet Weekend in Capri includes.  There should really be a better way to navigate the world of this game.  I haven't finished this game yet, but the puzzles mostly seem to involve doing errands for people, which, combined with the frusterating navigation, becomes incredibly tedious.  The people themselves are another annoying aspect of the game.  It's impossible to talk to any of them, which seems odd for a game that takes pride in being located in a real place.  You'd think being able to talk to people would add to the reality of it.  The people themselves are also snapshots, by the way.  They are never animated, even when they're talking - even Myst animated talking people.  There are, in fact, very few animations in this game.This game has, for me, redefined bad games.  I cannot believe that someone allowed this game to be released.  It's amazing to me that someone seriously thought that basing a game off of thousands of touristy photographs would be a good idea - and some of the photos aren't even all that good, blurry, with bad composition, or lens flares.  My plan is to sell this game as soon as I can.  Although I can't get cash from any of the places in my area, I can get game credit.  The next time around, I'll make sure I thoroughly research the game before I buy it.  This game may cost only twenty dollars, but it's a waste of every one of those dollars.

10328,76498,A3Q6KRNB6VMNGE,B000IONGWC,flaviolius,"[19, 21]","When Sega's Virtua Tennis first appeared on the Dreamcast, it was easily the best tennis game ever made.  A follow-up, Tennis 2K2, improved on the original, and was eventually ported to the PS2, GBA, and PSP.  However, a rival franchise, Top Spin, soon appeared on the Xbox, and stressed realism over the simple arcade action offered by Virtua Tennis (which was originally an arcade game anyway).  The questions were soon asked:  a) Will Virtua Tennis return? and b) Will Top Spin influence it?The answer to the first question has been answered with an overwhelming YES, but the answer to the second may not be so obvious.  VT's trademark controls are back - one button each for topspin, slice, and lob shots, with the analog stick controlling both character movement and shot direction - but VT vets will undoubtedly notice some tweaks right away.The biggest addition is the ""running shot"", where your character will launch a powerful stroke while charging full-speed at a ball just out of reach.  While this allows you to return out-of-reach shots with more force, your court position becomes compromised, as you're often far outside the lines once your momentum stops.  What this means is player position in relation to the ball is much more important than in the past two games (which would automatically adjust position for you as long as you hit the button at the right time).  In Virtua Tennis 3, it's more difficult to get precise angles and top-power shots, but ultimately, this makes the gameplay deeper and makes hitting great shots more rewarding.But isn't Virtua Tennis supposed to be an easy-to-learn, easy-to-play experience?  Well, yeah, and it still is - it's just that the learning curve is a little steeper.  One might wonder if Sega did this in order to give the online portion of the game lasting appeal, and it certainly seems like it worked, for better or worse.Create-a-player and World Tour are basically the same - start with a scrub and slowly work your way up through the rankings over a 20-year career, playing imaginative mini-games to improve your skills, entering tournaments, and collecting new gear.  Outside of World Tour, there are  Exhibition matches and Tournemant mode to play (with up to four players, with options galore), and you can also play the mini-games with multiple people via the new Court Games mode.VT3 has vastly improved visuals.  Player models are crisp, clear, and colorful, the courts are full of personality, cheering crowds, and ubiquitous advertising. While some player close-ups still look like brain-dead clones (or worse), the motion capture is amazingly, hauntingly realistic.  Federer's casual yet deadly serve is perfect, Sharapova tucks her hair behind her ears, Nalbandian does his one-legged power backhand, Nadal dashes all over the court, Davenport wraps the ball around her racket when serving....the attention to detail is astonishing.  The music is the same guitar cheese as before, which is a love-it-or-hate-it detail, but the rest of the sound effects are spot-on (a few overly energetic grunts aside).VT3 is easily as good as either Top Spin title, and is arguably the best tennis game ever produced.  New players shouldn't have a lot of trouble picking up and playing, but long-term fans of the franchise should be ready for a small and sobering dash of realism.  A tiny bit of the Virtua Tennis magic has been lost, true, but do not let that stop you from picking this up, as there's certainly enough goodness here to make up for it.Virtua Tennis 3 comes strongly recommended as a highly enjoyable single- and multi-player experience (thank goodness for wireless controllers!).  It's without a doubt one of the finest four-player non-shooter games on the 360 (nice to have a four-player game with no split-screen!!), and even gamers who don't normally play sports or tennis games may very well find a lot to like.",4,Slight changes make VT3 just short of perfect,1174521600,"03 22, 2007"

They just can't do it. Nor can they get people to care about their stupid stories that do nothing but interrupt the whole point of GTA: Cause havoc. Instead, starting with the most insulting bang that was GTA IV (because what the GTA really needed was mandatory darts and hanging out with idiot characters who aren't at all likable, not that silly ""sandbox"" idea of doing whatever you want, when you want, and how you want), they continue to make very slight changes to a formula that they're actively ruining with each new release. Somehow, for some reason, they still sink money into everything we couldn't care less about, especially story.If you play GTA for the story, you need to see a doctor. Games with stories are out there, and they don't stifle all the action like GTA loves to do, which completely dropped the ball when it came to focusing on its roots, instead turning it into a linear RPG with typical under-par Rockstar writing.Not quite as insulting as the disaster that was IV, which was, without the possibility of debate except by total lunatics who have no idea what they're talking about, a massive step down from San Andreas in every single way besides scenery.The GTA series is a lot like Madden. Minor changes not necessarily for the better or worse, just changes made because they need to put new features on the product, while deliberately avoiding making the game ""perfect"", because they know people will buy this garbage, anyway.At least Vice City is $4.99 on Android. It's hard to beat that, especially since it's a superior game to IV and now V. Awful. Anyone still following this series really need to stop Rockstar from not needing to care. Let's face it, they're a bad developer. They ruin game after game because they can't make quality. They can't get it right, anywhere.Of course, they don't need to get it right, because people see a new Roman numeral next to ""Grand Theft Auto"", and that's the only selling point they need to keep players playing bad games. It works, apparently, so keep it up, Rockstar. You're doing great to fool people who have no pattern recognition, just like Madden fans and anyone who, understandably, was disappointed that Starcraft 2 was simply not as good as the original. If the formula is a money-maker, why change it?If you said something along the lines of, ""Because...uh, it's GTA!"" That's exactly right.More trash from Rockstar. Wonderful.

Games like Wii Sports, which came with the system, and Mario Party 8 have really made it more exciting getting gamers into the motions  of using the Wii at fun & gameplay. That also could be said for traditional sports games like baseball, and bowling. Although they've dominated thanks to Wii Sports, many other  companies have tried to make sports games that would seem to carry over as well. Now, Crave Entertainment has decided to make the gameplay of bowling fun for Wii owners to enjoy, but does it leave the thrill of the gameplay alive?Brunswick Pro Bowling for the Nintendo Wii, brings the action and gameplay of bowling with the the feeling of striking. The gameplay is simple bowling as you go though championship and traditional modes through 10 different alleys. The gameplay remains simple, as you used the controller to bowl like you did in Wii Sports, but the fun and gameplay doesn't appeal to new gamers. The graphics also feel a little choppy, and doesn't reel in the excitement well. Although some of the character motions from when you get a strike, to an actual turkey gobbling up works well, if you've scored 3 strikes in a row. The music feels casual, as well as the sound of the actual pins, but the fun could've been shined up a little more.All in all, if you're a die hard bowling fanatic, Brunswick Pro Bowling would sound like a must buy. But sadly, it feels more like it is a constant game sparing in the stores, because the fun doesn't thrive like Wii Sports made bowling shine. This game feels more like it is a rental that fits like the bowling shoes that shined on the lanes.Graphics: CSound: C+Control: B-Fun & Enjoyment: C 1/2- for solo players: C for multiplayerOverall: C 1/2-",3,Spare!!,1192147200,"10 12, 2007"

11632,227574,A37P3IV8758KUL,B00EFFW0HC,DeadPlacebo,"[2, 3]","With the console wars about to be reignited, there are two games that will lead the battle on both sales and people playing: Call of Duty Ghosts and Battlefield 4.  Fortunately for us, Battlefield 4 came out first as being one of my personal favorite shooting franchises, I'm happy to have that first.  I got mine on the 360 while I patiently wait a few weeks for Playstation 4 to release.  Until then, I'm left with simply a taste of what to expect from next generation.Dice and EA do a great partnership with these games to make them as realistic and fun as possible.  COD games typically have more cartoonish graphics and a video game feel to the weapons and equipment.  Battlefield games tend to have more basis in reality with both the look of weapons and the sounds of them.  In BF4, we're faced with some crazy weather, exploding buildings and gun battles that will make you think you're getting shot at in real life.First off, the campaign.  Most shooter games are not known for their campaign.  In fact, you could probably count on your hand the number of people who buy these games just for the campaign.  However, EA realized that for that handful of people, they'll make them happy.  This campaign plays out like a big budget Hollywood war movie.  It has better graphics than the online and more equipment and vehicles to use.  My one friend hated the online so I had him play campaign and now he's a BF fan!The online's first impression to me, and current impression, isn't the best.  The gameplay itself is loads of fun and I can't Bf4 1wait to get it on PS4 and play it for more time than I'll admit to.  However, there are little problems that they're yet to fix.  First off, when you level up online say from level 4 to 5...the next match you'll still be a level 4.  It's annoying as hell to have that progress erased in the 20 seconds between matches.  Next up, the game freezes a lot.  I can count on at least once a day my entire console locking requiring reboot because of this error.  Thirdly, the graphics suck.  The water in the 360 game looks like you're swimming through mercury.  The textures take 23 seconds (yes I timed it) to properly load.  Before that, your stairs are just ramps, everything is just mudded colors and your sights on your gun are not punched out yet.  It's very sad to see such a great game look so bad.  However, that's because this game shouldn't be on seventh generation.  Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 are not powerful enough to hold such a game.  Seeing footage for it on Xbox One and PS4 make me not only very optimistic about the game, but I've already committed to getting Battlefield Premium for my copy on next gen.Seventh generation hiccups aside, this is by far the best shooter on the marketplace and will take a miracle by COD to be better",3,Not Meant For Seventh Generation,1383609600,"11 5, 2013"

You're not out there to observe and take notes. You're not a scientist hoping to get on the cover of magazines. YOU'RE A HUNTER!""In a nutshell, you're supposed to shoot, shoot, and shoot some more.Tutorial mode? There's no tutorial mode....YOU'RE A HUNTER! Get in there, Van Pelt!GAMEPLAY:There are 5 types of challenges offered in this game:(1) NUMBERED:  Kill a certain number of animals, such as:- Kill 5 deer  in 2 minutes.(2) TAGGING: You must use special ammo to ""tag"" a particular animal, such as:- Tag 7 does in 2:30 minutes(3) AVOIDING: Avoid shooting a particular kind of animal, such as:- Avoid killing 3 red does in 2 minutes(4) SNIPER: Perform high skilled distance shots, such as:- Kill 5 Dodos in 2:30 minutes. Don't let the animal get too close; use the scope mode to shoot at a distance...(5) VITALS: Player needs to kill a certain number of animals by hitting their vitals only, such as:- Kill 5 gazelles in vital points in 2:00 minutesThere are also 4 boss battles for each area of the game.SO...HOW ARE THE GAME CONTROLS?In a word?FRUSTRATING.The controls in this game are horrendous. There are 2 control schemes, which I will list below.If you use the ""Touch Screen"" controls:Left hand: L trigger to shoot, the up key on the Control Pad to reload weapons, the right/left keys on the Control Pad to change weapons.Right hand: holds the stylus to control the targeting.This makes it difficult to reload or change weapons during a round.If you use the ""Circle Pad"" controls:Left hand: use the Circle Pad to control the targeting.Right hand: R trigger to shoot, X button to reload weapons, Y or A buttons to change weapons.If you take your thumb off the Circle Pad, the gun sights return to the center, and this makes it next to impossible to target animals precisely.TROPHIES:There are 3 trophies to earn for finishing this game in easy, medium, and hard mode. When an animal is shot, their image appears in the trophy room. Finishing the game and shooting at least one of every animal will unlock all the images.PROS: Since I like collecting things in 3DS games, I enjoyed the wide variety of animals available to hunt down. I almost wish there were more!The music during most of the stages was very soothing, and the music they chose for the boss battles sounded very similar to Metal Gear...they were designed to get your heart pumping for the ultimate battle between human and beast!CONS:I admit, this is the first hunting game I've ever played, but I was willing to give it a fair chance. I played through the game in medium and hard modes over the course of 4 days, it took me 12.5 hours (total) to unlock all the skill points, defeat all my enemies and unlock all the animals in the trophy room.But in the end, I didn't really enjoy myself. Why? Well, let's go through the cons I mentioned earlier:(1) Low replay value - There is really no incentive to finishing this game more than once. Since the control scheme is difficult to get used to, when (or if) you finish this game, it'll gather dust on your shelf until you trade it in.(2) The 3D in this game is nauseating because your visual field is constantly changing while looking for prey. I turned the 3D off within 20 seconds, and never turned it back on.(3) One of the great functions for some 3DS games is the Nintendo StreetPass. With this function, I can get additional missions for several games, such as Resident Evil: Revelations, which I always look forward to.This game does not use StreetPass, so no extra missions are available.(4) ""Scope Mode"" is simply an exercise in frustration. During ""Sniper"" missions, you are expected to use your sniper scope and kill enemies before they get too close. I was able to finish this game on Medium and Hard difficulty settings without using Scope Mode at all. I found it was harder to hit my target while using it.(5) There were a few times when the game would lag, and there was stuttered graphics while playing. I had to turn off the game, remove the cartridge and restart my 3DS to clear up the problem. NONE of my other 3DS games have ever had this issue. I also noticed that in ""Tagging"" rounds, sometimes the tagged animals stayed on the screen and this kept other animals from appearing that I could tag.(6) If you don't shoot the bonus icons, they will disappear. I didn't realize this was necessary until I shot one by accident. The instruction booklet does not say you have to shoot the Bonus icons to activate them.(7) I have been writing this review for roughly 45 minutes and during this time, I have been in multiplayer mode, waiting to join a game. Not one game has popped up on my screen. All I can say is this...if no one is online to play Deer Drive Legends, I don't see any benefit to their online mode.FINAL THOUGHTS:While the ""numbered"" and ""avoiding"" and ""vitals"" challenges were very simple to complete, the ""tagging"" and ""sniper"" challenges were very frustrating.Add in glitches, an instruction booklet with omissions, the inability to choose your own weapon layout, no online players to play with, and this gives us our final result...a frustrating, mediocre 3DS hunting game.I would not recommend this 3DS title to others.",2,"Deer-hunter, waste not your arrow on the hare...unless you want it in the trophy room.",1343520000,"07 29, 2012"

The graphics are quite good considering the third party view point but the UI is really difficult to get used to. Too much click in five places to get something to happen - you can pause the game at any point while doing this but it's still very cumbersome and takes away a lot of the enjoyment. My biggest complaint is that the other party members tend to stand around doing nothing. I've tried everything but the PC group members are complete retards. It should be trivial to say 'attack this until it's dead' but they stop attacking after a few seconds or if the foe moves away. They won't even follow me, I have to keep right clicking to get the to come to me. Now maybe I've missed something in the UI that would make them act intelligently but it's my review and I don't like this game. Plus I paid too much for it :-(OK So I just figured out I must have hit the ""H"" key by accident.Anyhow this is still a poor game with good graphics.1. There are too many area transitions and they take too long.2. There are too many loooooong boring conversations and set pieces.3. The quests are poorly explained and too many of them are bugged (like abandoned orphanage).4. Intermediate quest points are not indicated on map or when you mouse over them so you're expected to memorize all 40 active quests?5. No free movement between places of interest (Oblivion got that right)6. Anvil of the void quest is bugged (party members stopped responding) - happens other places too (no I didn't press H)7.

Though I personally prefer the traditional Rhythm games starting all of it on a easy mode then upgrading with the songs, this is a game that strays from that in the main story line but gives you the option to replay later on. I give the game props for including everything that should have been included.As for 3D, it looks amazing during the cut scenes but unnecessary during any other moment.One thing the game does is utilize the other 'forgotten' feature of the console in optional mini games.

Here's a quick rundown of everything that you get, in terms of packaging:-Comes in a large printed cardboard box, styled like in-game crates.-Right on top is a hand-written note (actually printed), which seems to be a message between in-universe characters regarding the shipping of this crate, and you're down the rabbit hole.-Right below the note is a guide to assembling a few bits on your Noble Team Statue, and instructions on how to remove the statue from the box without damaging it.-There's a large and incredibly detailed statue of Noble Team included, which is absolutely breath-taking.-And you get the whole Collector's edition of the game.Inside the Collector's Edition:-The game, in a normal Xbox 360 game case.-A journal, ostensibly from the character Dr. Hallsey, who is central in the Halo series' plot. This book is absolutely gorgeous. The spine is sewn, and the book has a magnetic clasp. The pages are filled with intricate insights into the Halo universe, and there's a pocket in back stuffed with additional materials. Some of the additional materials include a real cloth Noble Team iron-on patch, and a map of Planet Reach with annotations as to major story points.When you finally fire up the game:-Reach's singleplayer campaign is incredible. Every mission is something new, from outright slugfest going toe-to-toe with the Covenant, to driving missions, to new space combat missions. Everything is wonderfully presented and fun. You can also play Campaign in 4-player co-op.-Firefight mode, wherein you face wave after wave of increasingly difficult enemies. This mode is loaded with customizable options, and can be played over Xbox Live like all the other modes.-Multiplayer, which includes everything from ranked deathmatch playlists to king of the hill games to capture the flag to who even knows what? Bungie rotates these lists frequently, so things are always fresh.-Forge 2.0, the highly improved map editor that was so flexible in Halo 3 that players invented whole new gametypes- some of which became standardized for Halo: Reach (such as Zombie/Infection). Forge has improved massively, and the possibilities are endless.And that's not all!-A new Armory system allows you to gain credits with everything you do, from playing Campaign to online multiplayer. Spend your credits to unlock visual flair for your Spartan (cosmetic only), and even different voices for your character to use in Firefight mode. The most expensive items will reward the stalwart player who keeps coming back.In short, there is a LOT of content in the Halo: Reach Legendary edition. The price at launch was absolutely worth it. The Noble Team statue is a centerpiece in my Halo collection now, right beside the SPARTAN helmet from the Halo 3 Legendary Edition. The game itself is rocking fun, and an incredibly appropriate farewell to the series since Bungie has sworn this is their last Halo title (at least for now).

Monkey missions(I usally don't play em' much, but yea.)-The limited edition version comes with a DVD which splices all the cutseenes together and makes it a 3 hour 55 movie, and has a trailer for Metal Gear Solid 4(Altho if you have a limited edition version, it's best not to open them, if you know what I mean)-No Radien, despite Snake is sometimes called Jack, which was Radien's name(I still don't get what was up with that?)-Also included are the sequals, or rather the 2 games that came after this, Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2:Solid Snake(The 2 japanese versions that didn't come out in america; well the second anyway.)-One of the best endings I've ever seen(Man, Kojima is just a genious.  A prequal yet can beat out his earlier versions in endings)The greatest prequal ever made, with the plot surpassing it's predissecorsThe best Metal Gear Solid experience you can find when it comes to plot, no doubt, and if you have yet to play Snake Eater, don't start there, start here.Cons:-What is this game famus for? hmmmmmm, oh LONG CUTSEENES AND CALLS(I doubt that will ever change)-No Radar, which makes it harder to know where the enemies are, and which way they are looking(Altho it's less of a problem with the 3rd person camera, it's still a problem)-Even with camo, I get seen as if I were a shadow in broad daylight when I'm standing(Crawling takes a while, but it pays off with a stealth kill, but still)-Keeping an eye on everything can get repetitive(Like after I healed a gunshot, some butt-monkey shot me with a poison needle)-Traps are usally hard too see(Like getting stuck with arrows, walking into mines, ect. unless you got thermal goggles)How could Snake not like James Bond flicks!?(After I saved it once, he talked crap about Bond, and in the 60s Sean Conery was Bond, the BEST BOND. I'd understand if it was Roger Moore, the major had every right to say something back at him)-Is Volgin gay?(It's just that in a sertain seene he seemed that way)Metal Gear Solid 3 is back, and back in a bigger, revamped way. Metal Gear solid 3 substance, is definitly better than MGS VR missions, and MGS2: substance by far.  If any game developer is planning to make a game they made much more improved, they should check out how better this game is from the regular MGS3.  This game is definitly recomended for those who love the MGS series, and those who love stealth games.  Even if you have the regular MGS3, grab this, and if you never played MGS3 grab this. If you wanna be in a videogame where survival is not in a horror game, check this out.  If you have a PS2 and don't have this game, someone should serve you up with a facial slap.PS.oh yea...

7865,179724,A343Y5INJ89IEZ,B00503E8S2,"Princeps P ""The Princeps""","[7, 9]","I have been a Halo and Gears player for years and just recently purchased Battlefield 3 and Modern Warfare 3. Both are a different type of gameplay than what I am accustomed to, but both do have their pros and cons. Even though this is a MW3 review I will incorporate BF3 into it as well just for comparison, as I believe BF3 is more similar to MW3 than Halo. I am reviewing this game from a technical perspective, not so much from gameplay. Everyone is different when it comes to what they like, so my preference should not be a factor. However, if you are an avid Halo and Gears player then our taste could be similar.First off, I am only addressing the online play. I owned the original MW and did not like it for the unlimited spawning of enemies, so I never bothered to buy any of the subsequent titles; from what I have read this is still the formula for campaign.  Many of the previous reviews are upset with the lack of evolution from MW2; I will not be able to comment on that. I find the graphics and the sound par with other Xbox games that have come out recently. I do think that BF3 does look better with the optional texture pack installed. Either way with the fast action of both games it is really hard to stop and look around.The multiplayer gameplay is very fast-paced. I believe it gives enough options for someone to choose what they would like to play. I really like the custom upgrade system where you choose your own path. BF3 has an upgrade system, but it is based on a pre-defined technology tree.  I am very big into objective based games and teamwork, MW3 has added elements to encourage this type of play, but it still seems it is all about the K/D. Oddly, BF3 rewards more for objectives, but makes it easier for campers.  The MW3 servers appear to run smoothly and I have not encountered any problems. Sadly, the BF3 servers still have many issues, which make it very frustrating to play with friends in a squad. MW3 is a smoother experience in this aspect. However, the MW3 Elite service is horrid and still not functioning today. Battlelog for BF3 is fully functioning and I have not encountered problems checking my stats since launch.Overall, I would give the multiplayer part of the game 4 stars, based on ease of operation, graphics and sound. I marked off an additional two stars for the $49.99 price on the elite service, because this is integrated into the game and has been heavily marketed. Personally, I think this is just a way to fleece gamers' money. Sadly, Elite does not even work at this time. Unless, they guarantee a set amount of DLC, $49.99 on top of $59.99 game price is unacceptable. With that being said, the elite service is good for one year from date of purchase, so it is in everyone's benefit to purchase just before the release day of the first DLC to maximize length of service or when it is fully functioning.  I believe the amount of DLC will be dependent on the amount of people who shell over the additional $49.99. I have not seen any game rack up a year of DLC totaling $50 yet.In the end, I find the game frustrating and to fast for my taste, and not worth the $59.99 price plus an additional $49.99. I like to buy DLC on my terms, sometimes I get it all, and sometimes I just get the first offering. I am going to opt out of the $49.99 elite service and just hope the free stat-tracking portion is operational soon.If I had to pick between MW3 and BF3, I would pick BF3. They each offer a different experience. MW3 allows more character and class customization and can easily be played solo. BF3 has planes, tanks, helicopters, larger maps and offers more points for completing objectives, but is frustrating if you do not have a good squad-better played with friends. MW3 is just to fast-paced for me and is too dependent on kill streaks. Technically the game plays smoothly, but is just not for me.",2,Honest Review from Halo Gamer,1321056000,"11 12, 2011"

I normally play those kiddie-friendly PSP games (e.g. LocoRoco, Katamari, Little Big Planet - you get my idea), but then one day I decided to get some hack & slash game for a change. I didn't want to jump into the most complicated one, and I wanted to get something that doesn't have a long playing time. I was contemplating on GOW or Dante's. Since my husband was still playing his GOW, I decided to get Dante's Inferno. I wasn't disappointed.I tried the classic level first - as this is the easiest level, and the tutorials were great - for a first-timer on this type of game I was able to get used to the controls. Eventually I got hooked and played the game to the end, despite a lot of curses shouted because this game seems to have a lot of climb, jump and grab, and also falling floors from which I tend to die more often than with the boss fights, lol...I admit the storyline and controls are somewhat very similar to GOW, but this is still worth playing. From here at least I know I am able to move forward with more hack & slash adventures with my PSP.",4,Good for beginners too,1279238400,"07 16, 2010"

9217,39171,AC5SRB7KCAIEE,B00009M7Q8,Matthew Warner,"[60, 65]","If you've heard of the original Deus Ex before, then you've probably heard some things about it's sequel.Depending on where you look, Deus Ex: Invisible War (i.e. Deus Ex 2) is either a refreshing breeze in console gaming, a horrifying example of what happens when you ""dumb down"" a game to appeal to a broader audience, or the worst thing ever subjected to the video gaming public.Hmm.I bought the game (mixed reviews or no) and went through it in three days, determied to come to my own conclusions. And now, I can safely say, that nearly every review I read was spot on. Depending on how you look at it, this can be a fantastic game, a death knell for intelligent game design, or a steaming pile that you accidentally stepped in and now it's stinking up the house.That said, I'm not going to get into the plot of either the original or of Invisible War here, since this is one of those rare games where it's best to go in blind, but everything else is fair game. So...Having been a massive fan of the PC original, I'd been awaiting the release of Invisible War since Warren Spector himself, adressing some fan's issues with the multiplayer patch, mentioned that they only had one guy on the team still working on the original Deus Ex; everyone else was hard at work on the game's next installment.Which brings me nicely to point number one: If you've yet to play the original Deus Ex, go there first. It can be had for next to nothing, will run on practically any modern PC, and it easily the best way to determine whether this type of game is for you or not without having to spend a lot of money. On top of that, and despite what a lot of reviews have said, DX:IW is indeed a true sequel to the original. It picks up twenty years later, but there's no doubt that you're in the same world, and having the events of the first game under your belt will aid immensely in getting through the second installment while still having some idea of what the hell is going on (not a given with these games - you have to pay attention).So, assuming that you're familiar with the first game and liked it as much as everyone seems to, here's the real question: Does the sequel stack up?Not really.But it's still pretty fun.The biggest gripe that can be said about IW, and the one that nearly everyone comes to independantly, is that the game feels cut. And I'm not talking about things that were omitted from Invisible War that were in the original (did anyone ever use the Iron Lung mod, anyway?) I mean it feels like things were going to be implemented in Invisible War that were ultimately dropped. It's like watching a movie where you just know that there was something that got cut at the last minute, and they didn't have time to re-edit it properly.The best example I can think of is right at the beginning of both games. In the original DX, you start right in the heart of things, engaging in a sting operation to free the Statue of Liberty from terrorist occupation. You go in, you do your thing, the game quietly keeps track of HOW you do your thing, and then...You go to work. It's established that you're essentially a futuristic cop, and much of the early part of the game is spent establishing the plot and showing off your technology to let the player acclimate to it. So, when things start to go haywire (which, and I mean this in a good way, they do quite suddenly) it's honestly engaging, especially as the layers begin to reveal themselves. Do you stick with your old affiliations? Oh, wait, they were operating behind your back! But...So were the other people you were going to work for! Aaah! Who do you trust?By comparison, DX:IW gets you dressed, prepped, and out the door in the first ten minutes of gametime. You're out of Chicago in the opening movie, in Seattle in the first scene, and then BAM, you're free of all obligations right from the get-go. No police affiliation, no real information, but thankfully, everyone seems to know your number and wants to call you. It sounded good on paper, I'm sure, but in practice it's jarring and serves more to distance the player from the game than anything else. You never really get the chance to feel betrayed or double-crossed by anyone, because, well, you never really care about them to begin with.It's a tough sell to explain this to someone who is unfamiliar with either game, so here's something worth noting: The only way you'd notice is if you played both games.The other big gripe about DX:IW is that it runs horribly, regardless of which platform you choose. If you'd rather go with the PC version, expect to burn some serious power on this game. The Xbox version, which is pretty choppy and prone to slowdown, at least looks good when it's not moving, and is definitely the better choice for anyone without a monster PC. This was a common complait with the first game as well, though it's a moot one now.Here's the kicker: Even the most stringent critic of DX:IW noted that, while they thought the game was loaded with problems, they kept playing it. A lot. Sometimes, when they beat it, they'd fire it right back up and start all over again.What gives?Well, it sounds odd, but for all this game's problems and occasionally wonky design scheme (all weapons use the same type of ammo? C'mon...) it's still fun. In fact, a lot of the time it's so fun that you forget about all the other stuff that bothered you about it, and at the very least it makes these problems forgivable. I beat the game in three days. If I wasn't having fun, there's no way I could have done that, I don't care how much I loved the first game. With DX:IW, the problems will bother you if you let them, and particularly if you were a big fan of the first one, but at the end of the day, it's still a fantastically fun game. Manipulating all the factions to your whim, or having them do it to you, is such a cool game mechanic that it overshadows everything else and really saves this game. Again, critics will point out that this was done better in the first game (and it was.) Taken on it's own merits, though, DX:IW is a competent sequel that still gave me that same sense of cool that the first one had in droves.It just took some digging to find it.",4,Deus Ex Lite,1071187200,"12 12, 2003"
2726,183314,A2LYNOAPUNL2IV,B0050SXFKE,Cy,"[0, 1]","Assassin's Creed is one of my absolute favorite video game series on the Playstation 3 system, so when I found out that ACIII was coming out with a whole new story and assassin, I was pretty pumped. I had really high expectations for this game. Leading up to ""Revelations"", the games seemed to be getting much more interesting and gameplay was, ultimately, getting better. While I loved this game overall, there were things that bothered me and kept me from enjoying the game as much as some of the prior games: My favorites being ""Brotherhood"" and ""Revelations"" (""Brotherhood"" being my favorite in terms of story and ""Revelations"" being my favorite in terms of gameplay and weaponry).---PROS:The introduction of a new lead character and the different things he's capable of was a really nice change of pace! The whole concept of the story intersecting with the Revolutionary War and events surrounding it was extremely intriguing. Connor is an interesting character. He's flawed, fierce and likeable, just as Altair and Ezio are in the previous games. The addition of Connor's naval battles was also really awesome. A really cool step-up in giving the gamer a new and interesting experience that was still relevant to the story. Plus, he's awesome at climbing trees. Another really cool addition.The use of historical figures was, once again, really intriguing.The story goes more in-depth with Desmond. This game goes further in Desmond's storyline than any others. Rather than Desmond feeling like a side-character with a random quest just getting ""thrown-in"" at the end, you continually break from Connor's story to go on quests with Desmond. This was a nice change in pace, and made the story come together as a whole more. Also, cliff-hanger (ugh)! Glad to know they're setting the story up for the next game in the series (which I'm assuming will feature Connor again).I really loved the areas that were explored. Boston and New York were very beautiful and the ever-expanding fronteir was so different from prior games, it made for really exciting exploring and side-quests. The homestead missions were a nice side feature as well, and the character of Achilles was really interesting.New weapons! Really liked the bow and arrow and the rope dart was AWESOME.---CONS:The gameplay irked me. Why change what isn't broken? I thought throughout the Ezio trilogy, the game-makers steadily improved upon the controls and ease of controlling the main character. They weren't perfect, but they worked. Suddenly, the style of fighting changed. Don't get me wrong, it's not drastic, but enough to really throw a wrench in my enjoyment. For one, I continually kept holding R1, trying to parry or counter attack (as the prior games have used this button), when the new system uses the O button as the new counter option. Okay, okay... maybe I'm whining. But instinctively I kept going for R1, because that's what has been drilled in my brain since the beginning of the entire series, and then realizing halfway through getting pummeled that I was slapping the wrong button.I found the graphics to be really glitchy. While the landscapes and designs were stunning (seriously, some of the best graphics I've seen in a while), they were set back by a lot of weird quirks. More than once I found characters getting stuck in random places (i.e. I was fighting a guard when all of a sudden he just froze in place, and Connor couldn't kill him despite swinging at him with his ax for 5+ minutes). I also had a strange problem with Connor freezing up often, especially after ""analyzing clues"" in the frontier areas. Plus, for some reason (and maybe this happens in the other games and I just never noticed it as much), as Connor was free-running through the towns and such, the graphics would materialize weirdly in front of him (as though they weren't loading properly in some spots).Confusion with two things throughout the gameplay: the recruiting of Assassin's and the Homestead related tasks. The recruiting of Assassin's was extremely confusing and not explained well. Like the prior couple games, the ability to ""recruit"" members to the Assassin's team was possible. There's one mission early on in the game where you recruit your first one. After that, I had NO idea how to recruit others. Maybe it was just me, but I was terribly confused with the Assassin's menu and options that went along with it. As for the Homestead, after I had people join the homestead, I was really confused on what to do with them: the sending of convoys, gathering recipes, etc.I missed my crossbow.---OVERALL:If you're an Assassin's Creed fan, you must play this game. Just be warned that there are some changes and that they may bother you the same way they bothered me. Here's to hoping the next game in the series is able to smooth these rough patches out.",3,"By no means the best in the series, but not a bad addition...",1354406400,"12 2, 2012"

From Final Fantasy and Ultima to Diablo these games have left players wanting more. Diablo III has been out for the PC for sometime now and it seemed that the console market was going to be left out. But no more as Blizzard has released this game both for the XBox 360 and the PS3. But will this be a worthy experience or should you just stick to playing this on your PC?The story and content for the most part are the same with the console versions and the PC version. Everything is there from the origins in New Tristram to the finale of beating Diablo it is all there. The bonus levels are even included so you can find development hell or wander into the brightly colored world of Whimsyshire. There are tons of items that you can get for the various classes you play in the game from the steely barbarian to the steadfast monk.I was worried a bit about the translation of this game from the PC to the consoles. There have been many horrid adaptations of PC games to consoles and vice versa. However Blizzard was on point with this conversion and has even made some really great upgrades. For example you don't have to be constantly connected to the internet to play this game. You can play this game online with your friends but also offline if you wanted to. Also playing this on a console adds a bit more control to the game but with using dual analog sticks the controls feel more fluid on the PS3 than a regular PC.My main problem that I have with this game is that it is tied to the console services. For example if you have a friend that plays Diablo III on the PC you can't join their game on a 360 or PS3. The reason is that the PC, XBox 360 and the PS3 have their own networks and none are compatible with each other. It would be nice to see some type of sharing application or syncing where everyone could join everyone elses game but for now it's just simply impossible.So is this a game that you should get if you have it already on the PC? Not really. But if you haven't experienced this game yet and own an Xbox 360 or PS3 then rush out and get this game now.",5,PC Classic hits the consoles!,1383091200,"10 30, 2013"

I have little doubt that Sony is going to release a Vita Slim in about a year with a few minor tweaks. The Vita is, without a doubt, an impressive system. However, it's also a costly one. The $250 price tag is just the start. Then you must buy a memory card (minimum of $20), a case, and the very expensive games (up to $50 each). I think Sony is pricing itself out of the market, especially when you can buy a Kindle Fire for $200 and be able to play games, browse the web, and check e-mail. This price point didn't work for the Nintendo 3DS, and that was with less expensive games and not having to buy a memory card. Also irritating is that Sony created yet another memory card format, so you can't use anything you already have. In retrospect, I probably would have waited a while to purchase to see if the price will drop. The Vita has not been selling well in Japan, and I was a little surprised when I stopped at Target after work today to pick up some games and discovered that they had several Vitas still in stock.The initial lineup of games is not particularly impressive. Some are titles that have been previously released on other platforms, which makes you wonder why they're still commanding a premium price. All the games seem overpriced.With a price drop and more reasonable game pricing, this could be a successful system.

(This is a game that visits the worst human tragedy in known history - World War I)  Violence, language and general depravity considered, even an adult might want to rethink her/his steps when purchasing this item. Some of the actions and environments were so intense, they literally made me feel weird and bad. I truly felt anger at the end and actually cried during the final sequence.If you can shrug off these warnings, you are in for arguably the most substantial experience on the 360 so far.Even in its earlier releases, Starbreeze prided itself in challenging the player to think outside the bounds of what was possible within a game, and The Darkness continues that legacy. From a first person perspective, the player inhabits young hitman Jackie's persona as he unravels the mystery of his (unexpectedly granted) powers. The plot thickens as Jackie's battle with his own (Mike Patton voiced) demons escalates as does his confrontation with a previously patriarchal uncle-turned-nemesis. With just enough twists and unexpected surreal moments, the ride is a perfect, if taxing one. For a superb shooting mechanic, sick & constant sense of humor, and moments of shock that truly shock, you can't do better than the Darkness.On the minus side, there are long wait times between Entrance/Exit points and the map is virtually useless. Glitchy controls with regards to the (Primarily most useful tool of) Creeping Dark slow down the otherwise frenetic pace of confrontations. Achievement Hounds should also be warned: some of the achievements in this game are ambivalent, to say the least. I'm a fan, and have yet to unlock many of them.Such qualms aside, this is the game people who loved ""Riddick"" should be ready to expect: A rock solid shooter that feels more like an RPG or sandbox game.Insane attention to detail, impeccable visuals, and a nasty sense of reality.The most profound and simultaneously profane experience the 360 can offer.You have been warned.",4,"Very, very dark",1220486400,"09 4, 2008"

But it is not as bad as you think. Takes only a couple of minutes to figure out the new controls. And yes you can reload your weapon in mid-clip. Just hit the Down Arrow on the Dir. Pad.Pros:With kills/points you can unlock higher classes.There's a limited number of each class, so you dont get overwhelmed by special classes.The medals system is a nice touch. So many kills/points with certain weapons gains you Boosts or Equipment Upgrades. And an increase in rank will give you Squad Members.Gameplay is now more diverse, and the clumsy starfighters are now gone. They are now more like the SW craft in other SW games (Rogue Squadron for example).The maps are definitely interesting. With a wide variety to choose from.Start with the Rise of the Empire campaign-- helps to become familiar with the controls while picking up experience.The long delay between switching weapons is gone. Now its a more reasonable delay, letting you switch to a different weapon if you come to the end of a clip.You can earn Jedi/special characters while playing (single, multi, etc.). The Jedi/Special Characters *can* be killed, they are not invincible.Addition of a Stamina bar. This bar reduces with sprinting, jumping. When flying or in a vehicle, the bar is an Energy bar, representing available boost or special manuevers.Cons:Overheating certain weapons happens often, until you realize that you can do a quick burst of fire, then lay off with the occasional shot while you wait for it to return to normal.You can't always be the characters you want, and the limited numbers mean that if your skills are lower then you might not get a chance to play as a special unlock character/jedi.Overall: Very enjoyable for previous SW:BF fans, and SW fans in general.",3,Return of the Battlefront,1131494400,"11 9, 2005"

Quake Wars brings you into a lesser known Quake setting...your own planet. Strongly departed from the old Quake experience it at least draws upon some old familiarities.The games pc counterpart delivered the goods, this once feels like faulty packaging. The online has many hiccups,and hideously poor graphics, but one can get a good game going. The single player experience on the other hand is pretty much the same as multiplayer, just without the whole social aspect tied in.Essentially you'll be completing objectified missions, broken down into easily digested proportions. Objectives become very linear upon realizing the formula. Making this definitely not a single player title.To justify no real single player or compelling story the multiplayer had to be top notch. Unfortunately it isn't, but has a great experience tracking system (that's not going to save you know buddy). You can obtain upgrades briefly per match, while only temporary they focus and reward the player for doing good based upon what class they are. Matches very in length generally with a duration of about twenty minutes or so. Long enough to complete objectives, but on harder settings it's a different story.One can easily maintain a good kill death ratio, have great accuracy, and a strong strategic plan...but with dull A.I. you're not going to get anywhere really. The timer runs out faster then you can defeat the enemy. Problem is it becomes a one sided war, more or less it's only you doing all the fighting!The weapons lack variety, the classes are dull, and both the multiplayer/singleplayer are lacking. The graphics as mentioned are cruddy, but some decent lighting saves it a bit. The controls are decent, frame rate not too bad. Vehicles seem a bit unbalanced, yet too weak when one uses them. The maps offer a bit of variety but not enough to save the game. Given over the course of a week to play it grew on me a pinch, still not worth a purchase though. Desolation swept the online with a drought of players (matches taking a long time to assemble the few players).

If you're reading this, you've probably been looking forward to Civ IV also. Well, the publisher obviously rushed it out the door before it was done.The biggest issue is that it's slow even on a nearly new top of the spec machine. And turning down the graphics details, etc., doesn't do all that much to help. The graphics aren't that great anyway, everything is a little fuzzy even on the highest setting.Then there are a lot of minor, but very annoying, things that didn't get done. Throughout the manual it says to ""roll over"" things to get help. But most of the help system apparently wasn't completed, because there's no rollover help.It says to press Escape to get out of screens. But it doesn't work on several of them, you have to find the exit button and press it. And the exit button is in a different place on every screen - no consistency at all.And then there's the web site - I went to try to see if there was any help or patches, but it won't let you in if you don't have Flash. Some of us don't want or can't use Flash - if you don't provide us an alternative, then you're shutting out a lot of people.I'd suggest skipping this game until either the price drops twenty bucks or they get some major patches out the door (and let you into their web site to get them).",1,Not Done Yet...,1131148800,"11 5, 2005"

Anything that could be good or would be good about this game goes out the window. No map in the world would be fun with these 3 problems. You can do fairly well in the game but mostly by using camping methods & spawn camping methods that are not very fun to play. The usual run and gun method will get you killed quickly unless your on the good side of the connection. Even then its 50/50. Add in the multitude of angles you can get shot from on most of the maps doesn't help. I like the dog streak because its new but it is a kick in the balls when the dumb dog kills u. Quickscoping is abused in this game now. Aiming not required. Killstreaks are boring. Sound whoring and Oracle streak are cheap. SatCom spam forces you to use most of the Stealth perks unless u want to be an easy target. Not much way to tactfully and skillfully navigate your way around the maps due to spawns and insta-kills.

So I just picked mine up a few hours ago since I had it on preorder from Best Buy.  Don't get me wrong I kinda went through the motions of cancelling my preorder since I had no intention of really getting the console, but just in cast I did decide to preorder.  Its odd a lot of people I tell I have a Wii U most people don't know what it is.  They ask if its a add on to the Wii.  I have noticed that the reviews on Amazon aren't really flooding in like most popular items do.Now a little back story and explanation of myself.  I will justify my purchase to you the consumers.  All these comments are to help you become engrossed and in love with my review.  Is it gonna be worth that $350 clams I payed or in my case over five hundred for everything such as games and controllers.  If I have learned anything when it comes from consoles I have started opting for the accidental protection plans or whatever its called I just put on my bill.  All that considering I have been through 3 PS3's and 3 360's.Personally I am still happy with my Wii and so are my kids.  I have always had a soft spot for Nintendo since I grew up in the 80's.  Though lately I do feel they have become almost Disney in appearance but the substance is a bunch of business men in suits.  Of course their is nothing wrong with that but as I have gotten older the magic has disappeared.  I no longer think Shigeru Miyamoto is a fantasy character created by Nintendo.  In my thirties now with my own kids I started thinking about the games that would probably come like Zelda, Mario, Mario Kart, Kirby and all those games Nintendo is known for and it really helped influence me.  I remember being small and opening those Nintendo packages starting with NES World Class Track Meet bundle.  Of course I had an Atari and Sega but always had a Nintendo for better or ill sometimes.  Playing Nintendo kind of takes me back to when games were just games and made you wanna smash the controller but it was all in fun and innocence.First off I think this is not that big of a leap from what I have seen and in my mind its probably a four year or so life cycle maybe less.  I think the HD should of been in the Wii but that's o.k. since I enjoyed it with my kids in SD.  I am not some childish fanboy by the way I play PC, 360, PS3, Solar Eclipses and Eggo Waffles so I enjoy it all and love the experience each bring.  My kids though are who will love this the most since they kept the Wii going and from collecting dust.  I have read some reviews on here and I roll my eyes like a teenage girl with two sentence reviews or the obvious people.  As far as me by myself I don't think I would buy it this quick if I didn't have kids.  My kids didn't ask for it but that goes to my Nintendo side of always owning a Nintendo something console.  I think people my age understand that spot in their hearts for Nintendo.  I am gonna review this objectionable as I can since I don't really hate Nintendo but I am not their biggest fan.So to the system itself the aethetics on it are pleasing to the eye though its just a big black rectangle and about the same size as the Wii but a little wider.  Personally its not that great looking but the game pad is the real draw and I think it looks fantastic.  It does fit weird in my hands but nonetheless its a eye pleaser.  That's just my eye and good god (no offense) it has so many finger prints on it right now and I have only had it for a couple of hours.  Everything about this black model just collects it like it was at a petting zoo.  Set up is a cinch and I had it all connected in about five minutes or less.  Syncing was no problem at all either and it recognized the handset almost immediately so as far as I can tell its been smooth.  It does come with HDMI which is great instead of me getting home with component or s video cables and becoming Hulk like in anger.  I did notice the controller is pretty light and does feel somewhat like it could withstand a drop.  That is probably the one thing that worries me is my kids having it on their laps and forgetting its there than having it hit the floor as they stand up.  For some reason it reminded me of a lighter version of a Sega Game Gear though as far as size.  I might be remembering wrong though.  Time will tell if it will be a hindrance or a welcome addition to gameplay.  It does have the sensation of having something new and special to play with.  That really didn't sound right but it does.As far as memory I don't think I need as much as whats in this system but its welcome.  I have a 8gb 360 from awhile back and only recently filled that up.  Since I don't have a good internet connection all those extras don't matter much to me such as the apps like Netflix and the such.  Considering my others do that I don't really feel that I need it anyways.  I do enjoy playing older games though so I am interested what is gonna be offered on here.  50 bucks wasn't much for the upgrade to the bigger system so that also swayed me a little plus it came with a game.  If you plan on quite a bit such as streaming or downloading a bunch of stuff opt for this model.  I think a lot of people will be happy with the 8.Now this is the rub and this will show me who actually read my review with all the unhelpful votes and all the comments saying ""wait you reviewed it without playing it"".  Most these helpful and unhelpful numbers are irrelevant to the review since its obvious most people don't read them completely.  Oh and console wars cause console erections so they all come out of the wood work with their input.  Anyways as I said this will be a progression probably over a week for me to get a good review so I wanted to get it started while it was fresh on my mind.  Because reviews tend to get buried here on Amazon.  Right now it is updating that behemoth update and I hope this is the big one.  I don't have a hard line internet connection and am using a tethered VZ Wireless Droid Razr Maxx with 4g.  Its been going about two hours and is almost half way there.  I have read about peoples power cutting off mid or so through and bricking the console so my hopes are that won't happen.  My internet did cut out and it started back where it left off no problems and no starting over.  You can skip the update but eventually if you are connected to the internet you might as well do it.  I could of waited for the update to finish to write my review but I wanna make sure everything is up and running when I finish this long winded, horrendously drawn out, absolutely unnecessary, brain numbing review, big and stuff, kaboom.Though I know most people have not read this far since as of now it says 2 of 9 found it helpful and no one stopped to criticize.  I think people need to stop just look at stars and actually taste the substance.  Dip your finger in and give it a taste since no ones looking at this dinner party.  Don't be afraid to peek at the writing it aint gonna get you. Reviews are usually personal unless its those ridiculous fake ones from fanboys or the non.  Don't worry my review isn't gonna come back and get you in your dreams.  Anyways if you have questions or anything you want me to look into for you I will have no problem doing it so just let me know.So after my update is now finished I finally got to play the new Mario Wii U but of course after a update and I can tell it will be a family favorite.  The graphics really shine on this and its great to see Mario in HD and my kids are fighting with each other.  Nintendo you've done it again not only to bring families together but rip them apart.  I am enjoying using the handheld (honestly I have no clue what its called, maybe a tablet) as being the god hand in games like Mario.  We have yet to try Nintendo Land which is the game it came with.  We just couldn't resist Mario.One thing I noticed that the release titles I have pretty much played besides a couple already on other systems.  The first party games are usually what I think of the most when I think of Nintendo.  That's also a failing for me since I game on other systems, what third party support is gonna be here for me and why pick it over other systems.  Honestly other than family enjoyment I don't think I would own this console.  When my kids go to sleep odds are I will be burning up my other consoles playing more adult games.  Hopefully there will be many in the future of this console.  Another thing I did notice was they didn't go with any achievements which I find disappointing but freeing in a way.  I like them since it gives you something to earn for playing and getting points for no reason except to show off.As far as speed I noticed there were long load times such as when you are loading a game or changing menus on the Wii menu.  If you are use to blazing fast speeds from a iPad or a PC you may be in for some disappointment.  Its really not that noticeable but if you are into specs you will notice.  When you have to change menus there is also a pause for a few seconds.  My old Wiimotes synced with no problems at all and I haven't read the instruction manual yet so starting is relatively easy.  So far I am sticking to five stars with the console as is since I have yet to have a big problem and it really is fun.Next I will go into detail of my transferring my old Wii data to this U.  It is quite simple to do and it just involves a few steps of swapping your SD card back and forth and getting the transfer utility from the Wii Store.  Honestly its easy and all you have to do is consult your user manual or the internet since its got a wealth of info.  Really some of these reviews on here also have details.  I am disappointed that though I have money in my wallet I can't use it for my Wii U purchases.  I think its because I no longer have my subscription id or whatever its called for my Wii.  I tried to remember it all and the only offer they have is to find your password after you put in your user i.d. which I have no clue what it is.  So no usage of my Wii profile on the U just yet but hopefully I'll figure it out.The Nintendo Land game that's included is an absolute joy for the kids to play.  Usually I am holding the gamepad in my hand and my kids are the ones using the controllers.  There are around six muliplayer mini games and six or so single.  As far as enjoyment for me it really came from my kids playing the Mario hide and seek type game or the Luigis Mansion.  The game itself I probably would only rent but since it came with the console it shows off some potential for the gamepad.  I do recommend playing it since it does show off what opportunities come from playing with family.  These mini games will no doubt keep children entertained for hours on end I think.  Nice addition to come with the black console.I will update this review as I progress and the Wii U  grows on me.  I am wondering how multiplayer, third party, voice communication and other console norms will progress on this system.  Third party was very weak on the Wii which worries me.Though I am gonna go ahead and write my concluding sentence and it will sound like this that in conclusion the Wii U is a very enjoyable console and like its predecessor it will bring hours of fun.  Hopefully there will a larger following of the hardcore gaming crowd.  The price point is hefty but consoles don't really come out often so its up to the individual to decide whether this system will serve its purpose with them.  Put away that purchase of 350 dollars in shrimp and get this if you are convinced that its the next best thing to Skynet.  Personally its very intuitive to look at and use which leaves me to wonder what the future will hold for this system.  You can have confidence in buying this if you are into the first party games since Nintendo will in time unleash those.If your family was all about the Wii than there's really nothing wrong with this purchase.  If you are a hardcore elite gamer or whatever you call yourselves you may not find much here currently.  So wait if you want to see how the future pans out or get it now and start enjoying it for Christmas.  As for me the three stars is what I stick by for now and will change as the console progresses.  I don't really see how you can write a one time definitive review at the start of a console anyways.  Believe me five stars for fun but to me the console will have to be seen to whether or not its future shines bright for the almighty five stars overall.",3,"Good So Far, Very Enjoyable New Console and Hopefully A Good Future",1353283200,"11 19, 2012"

I've never really been into golf games, like those Tiger Woods ones, but when I bought Mario Golf (MGGB) on the Game Boy Color, I was hooked.  It's the only game that I actually still play from my GBC.  And then this game came out.  I never thought that they could outdo MGGB, but they did.  Advance Tour, like MGGB, is actually a role-playing game disguised as a golf game!  Ingenius!  Instead of fighting enemies to increase your HP or MP, you play tournaments or complete tasks that increase your control, the height of your shot, drive distance and more.  And the goal?  Why, it's simple--to the best golfer and someday play Mario!Graphics:  (5/5)  The Game Boy Advance's screen has never looked better.  Bright colors and fabulous simulated 3D images.  It's from the makers of &quot;Golden Sun&quot; (Camelot), so if you thought those graphics were awesome (I did), they're all here!

I don't know how they packed all this into one game!Gameplay:  (5/5)  Okay, I'm not the most coordinated gamer out there, so for me to say that this game is easy to learn, it says a lot.  But, like the real game of golf, it's easy to learn, but darned near impossible to master.  Plus, the game is limited to the few buttons the GBA has to offer, so expect those buttons to be well used.  The game itself is not merely a golf game, as I mentioned.  Like the box states, &quot;It's Role-Playing Golf&quot; and that makes it much more interesting than a plain old golf game.  But if you only want golf, you can have that, too, as well as a bunch of other mini golf-centered games.  However, with all the features locked away in the &quot;Story Mode,&quot; I'm not sure why anyone would buy the game and NOT play it like a regular RPG.  Also, you can link to other GBAs for muli-player cooperative or head-to-head action.  Camelot sure stuffed a lot of different features into this one tiny cartridge, let me say.Replay Value:  (5/5)  You won't be able to put this game down.  Ever.  You will lose friends, pets and the ability to see without glasses.  That's how much you'll be glued to your tiny front-lit screen.  Like I said, the game is easy to learn, but near impossible to master and that's what will keep bringing you back for more.  And then there's the ability to play with your friends in doubles play or against one another.  There's just so much to do!Let me start off by saying that this game is NOT just for people who love golf.  I'm not terribly fond of the sport, although I used to go every once in a while.  But Mario Golf, in the two incarnations I've played, are the BEST games out there.  They combine the challenge of golf and RPG into one slick game that the whole family can enjoy.  As far as I know, there's no violence in this game, so I can recommend this game to gamers of all ages, but because of the RPG-nature of this game, I think kids age 10 and up will appreciate the game much more.

So when I heard that they were making a game, I couldn't wait and I think the wait was worth it.  Now before I continue you should know that this is not a game to revolutionize games, its just a really fun puzzle game. Let's start with the puzzles.The puzzles are of a good variety from manipulating rooms to find the combination, manipulating your perspective so you know which way to go, and pretty much all of the traps that you have come to love from the saw movies.  Some of these will challenge you, and actually make you think, because you will have to really change the way you look at some of these puzzles in order to finish them.Another part is the combat.  Now its not the best set up, but you get used to it.  The character does hit a little slow, but that did not stop me from finishing it.  You will use weapons from the nail bat, shovel, scalpel, and a revolver.  Also you will find schematics in order to create traps, you can also disarm and rearm the shotgun trip wire traps for anyone that might be following you. I will say that you will be picking locks, setting fuses, and shutting off gas pipes a good amount.  This is the repetitive part of the game, but its not that bad.I should mention that this is probably a game for saw fans only.  That is because unless you like the story, characters, and all around saw atmosphere, you might not be able to get past the less then perfect combat or some of the repetitive puzzles.  But I will tell you why you should give it a try anyway.  One is the length, this is one of the few games with a good length in the campaign so you will not be done in like three hours.  Another reason is the trophies,  if you are looking for trophies then this is your game.  I finished the game today and only needed one more trophy before a platinum.

This is a masterpiece of an RPG, one that proudly stands alongside its predecessor as one of the best released in recent times.The game continues the adventures of monster-slayer Geralt of Rivia, as he continues to search for the lost pieces of his memory, and continues to get embroiled in a corrupt world of famine, racism, genocide, political corruption, and horrific creatures. Nearly everything that made the first game so great returns here - the strong, well-written narrative, the endlessly intriguing game world, the plethora of things to do, and the deep RPG mechanics that should satisfy both veterans and newcomers alike.There are a few key differences here from the first game. Despite being an obviously bigger and more expensive production, it is a much shorter, more compact and streamlined game. This does not make the game any better or worse, but simply different. The game manages to be equally as affecting and epic as the first game, even if you never get to know the world quite as well as you did the first time around. Combat has received a major overhaul, which now resembles the 1:1 combat often found in other sword-wielding, fantasy action RPGs. However, the combat remains incredibly satisfying, and is actually much more challenging this time around, as parrying and dodging have become even more of a necessity alongside the various sword and magic attacks available to Geralt. Inventory is now based on encumbrance as opposed to number of slots, and the alchemy and skill trees have become much easier to manage while retaining all the depth they've always had.The game has also received a major graphical overhaul, as environments and character animations are not only a huge step up from the first game, but are among the best of any games out there. The Witcher 2's presentation is simply stunning.Fans of the first game should be very satisfied with this excellent sequel, and The Witcher 2 also functions as a great introduction to this amazing universe, although I would highly recommend playing the original game, The Witcher, if possible. CD Projekt RED is one of the developers to watch going forward into the future, as they have created a game world that has few peers in the industry.

I liked the rendering and the artwork is pretty fun.The story is okay. It's not entirely believable, but it's okay.The gameplay is where the game shines. The shooting and the skill system work out well together and it all flows together very well.The biggest problems with the game are somewhat minor. I had one mission where I needed to infiltrate something. Well, the game lets you use a glider sometimes to get around the island and I am pretty good with it so I was thinking ""Man, I am going to infiltrate this boat from the sky. Screw diving in and climbing a ladder. I'll just drop in from the top and shoot people in the face."" Yeah, well the developers apparently had a different idea. I got about 150 M from my drop and the game slammed my glider into the ocean. I was thinking, ""Well this might be a glitch or something."" I reloaded the game and tried again from a different angle thinking perhaps I went in too hot or something. Nope... it just slammed me in the ocean again. I was pretty disappointed about that. I was really wanting to fulfill my ""drop from the sky"" plan.My bigger problem was just the sheer repetitiveness of the game sometimes. Find a radio tower. Climb it. Activate. Clear the outposts in the area you opened up. Rinse, wash, repeat 18 times for the radio tower and about 36 times for the little outposts. Also, while you're at it look for 120 relics that are a pain to get to most of the time, Rakyat trials that aren't all that exciting, 20 Japanese letters that give you all the rewards you will get after 6 (and the same goes for relics.. I haven't gotten anything since about 40)...Anyway, I'll stop there because I think you can get an idea of what I am talking about if I just say ""Wow, they took Assassin's Creed's formula for tedious searches and added guns!"" I am not the biggest fan of Assassin's Creed either. That game had a repetition problem too. It just smacks of a ""let's see how long we can drag this out."" Either way it was worth the 20 bucks I dropped on this game. I would recommend it if you generally like shooter games with an open world feel to it. Some of the stealth stuff can be pretty fun too. I guess it will just depend on what you expect out of this game. I would recommend it for most people.Edit 6/30/2013I decided to try the multiplayer because I was bored. I still haven't tried the competitive stuff, but I am a bit disappointed with the co-op multiplayer. It has an experience system that lets you unlock things and I like this. What I don't like is the constant dropping, reconnecting and lost xp that occurs because of ""dropped connection due to lack of players"" or some other excuse. I've only been playing it for about 3 days off and on and I have had two instances of playing for 45 minutes to an hour and it dropping and losing everything. I didn't gain a single thing from it. One time it just started killing me off and dropping me through the floor. The word is buggy. The game is extremely buggy. Also, there is no way to filter who you play with really on multiplayer. If you want to play hard on a certain map you create the game yourself, but people will just get randomly put in there and their skill level may not be anywhere near what you want. You may have people that don't sit well with your style too. You want to sneak and kill people rather than have the hordes gun you down? Forget it. You've got a better chance in hell of getting cold. You're going to be paired with people that will only run in guns blazing. Oh, and the ""competitive mode"" is terrible. If you're not the host don't expect to win some of those. Also, they are time consuming and tedious.I'll just say the multiplayer gets 2/5 stars. I only give it an extra star because the game is still fun sometimes, but horribly offset by its many shortcomings.Edit 7/13/2013I want to further expand on the multiplayer experience a bit. I am now (well I should be) level 70. I gained that level in the last game I played. Am I actually level 70 right now? No, all my progress was lost again. I played through an entire 45-minute long map only to have the game bug at the very end where you get the encrypted data and it not actually ""close"" the game to save your stats. So I had to quit to even continue playing after waiting several minutes for it to *gasp* do what it should do. I am actually dropping my star rating of this game because of the multiplayer now. I did consider this game to be a 4-star experience. I can see they really did not put much effort after a certain point. This could have been one of the best games ever. It's still fun to play if you can get over the constant frustration this game will bring you.Let me cover a few other points of frustration:1. You will play with people who have no idea what they are doing. They will go in guns blazing. They will enable objectives that will spawn enemies right on top of you. They will not revive you when you are right next to them and they are essentially safe.2. You will lag to death. Count on it. The competitions will never be fair because host almost always has a strong advantage on the gun competitions. They have to suck bad to lose usually.3. If the host leaves, expect to restart at the last checkpoint. The game doesn't care if you spent 15 minutes in the area finishing it off.4. If everyone leaves and you're at the end of the game, expect to lose all of your progress. This game will not let you solo a co-op. You're just going to get over all that time you just put in. For that matter count on this to happen a lot.5. Expect to die randomly. I said it. You will be walking. You will die. It will come from nowhere. There will be no explanation. It will happen frequently and you will witness it happen to others. Your teammates can't revive you. You just get to watch. Enjoy.",3,Fairly decent but ultimately repetitive.,1371686400,"06 20, 2013"

Once it came out I leveled my mage up as fast as I could, questing and knocking out the new instances which I thought were very well done.  The graphics were great, the new quests were well done, I pretty much enjoyed everything with the game.Then level 80 came and worked on farming the epix, first through the standard fare of farming rep and heroics, then on to the 10/25 naxx for the tier stuff.  Once the last patch came out however, I found that I was having a more and more difficult time staying interested in the game.  The same old prospects of hours of monotonous farming for tier pieces, as from lvl 60, then lvl 70 and now lvl 80 was dragging the game down.  Epix farming, a few new bosses as the guild managed to progress a bit, then more and more and more of the same old stuff.  Eventually I just stopped playing and recently canceled my account after years of playing the game.

The puzzles themselves are pretty easy once you find the missing item if they need one; you can also skip them. The fatal flaw with this game, IMO, is that there are only hints in the hidden object rooms--there is no way for me to get a hint on where I am to go from here, and 15 minutes of trying to continue game play is about it for me! Clearly others found more continuity here than I did, and I will also add that the artwork and general feel of the game is very good.

I had IMMENSELY enjoyed BALDUR's GATE I & II and all their expansions, a well as the ICEWIND DALE series. I had been enchanted by the best cRPG ever, PLANESCAPE TORMENT. Now the same game developers were delivering a 3D, cinematic version that would make total immersion inescapable! Right? Wrong, oh boy, so WRONG!Measly henchmen replacing our deliciously diversified company, nauseating camera movement, infantile designed objects, slow battle movements, low polygon characters and bland storyline. Now, NWN had its virtues, no doubt. It was such an original approach that games like WOW and OBLIVION borrowed heavily from its innovative concept of a Third-Person cinematic RPG. Nevertheless, it suffered from raising the expectations bar too high - and then not delivering but a fraction of its obvious potential. It eventually got accepted by the MODing community that created numerous ingenious MODs that saved the day.It has been over a year now and NWN2 does not seem to take off. It is as if no one wants to concern himself with it. And for good reason.The much higher system requirements do not translate onto the screen. There are improvements of course but not by much. It feels more like an expansion than a sequel.The camera movement is even worse. Much WORSE! Supposedly it positions itself in the best angle, Well, I found myself spending more time repositioning the camera than the interacting with the characters!Does it have bugs?

Because the entire community is a bunch of whiny sniveling children, they don't want anyone to ""pub stomp"", a term coined by the guys from Treyarch.  This is a laughable concept given that anyone can squad up and they don't have dedicated servers.  If your squad wins a game or two, take note, it punishes you and won't put anyone new in your lobby.  When this happens you can either back out and search again, or just wait for an eternity.  In either case it will merge you with with another lobby and you'll lose every gunfight.  Why does this happen?  Because matchmaking is based off winning and skill level and connection takes a back seat.  So essentially if your party wins a few games you'll be punished by being matched against another group that is considered ""at your level"", and the connection will be terrible.  I defended this game the first week it came out, saying the matchmaking would get better.

I'll first tell you overall how I felt the game was before I got stuck. It's a bit cheesy. Not Japanese anime RPG cheesy, but &#34;Oh, I get a staff, yippee!&#34; cheesy. The melee system is pretty bad. Other reviewers bash Oblivion for having repetitive combat? Yes, that's repetitive but this is really bad. Block attack, bash and kick them. Wait for your stamina to go up while you block again, then bash and kick them again. Repeat 20-40 times per enemy. This is 1990's RPG-level melee. The lightining indoors is horrible, and yes, you have infravision, but that just makes everything distorted and uneven light texture. I think that in trying to make the game different than Oblivion, they ended up with quirks that do NOT contribute positively to the game. They just should have made a solid, easy to play game, no matter what the management and polls suggested. I don't like the combat, spell system, and inventory system in general; not horrible but certainly not easy to use when you need to use it.

However, I do want to clarify now that, while the controls did take a bit of getting used to, once you were used to them, they were quite easy and comfortable, and to be honest, I can't imagine playing the game any other way. So, the controls were great, graphics and sound was superb, the acting was wonderful and the story was enjoyable. Overall I would have to say Alan Wake was a pleasurable experience.Although, pleasurable as it might be, it was far from perfect! I've given you the pluses, now it's time for the negatives.To begin with, the game felt like a long playable commercial for energizer and Verizon. I think I saw ""Energizer"" more times than I saw and heard the name ""Alan Wake"". Perhaps they should have just called the game ""And going...and going...""? I am seriously surprised that at some point the energizer bunny didn't come beating his drum across the screen.Next, the game is way too short! The game is divided into 6 ""Episodes"" which is basically 6 levels. each episode can be finished anywhere between 1 to 2 hours, depending on how hard-core you are playing and how throughly you are investigating the locals. However, what this means is, you could in theory beat the game in about 7 or 8 hours. Now, normally that's not a huge thing, since most games feature an Online play mode, however Alan Wake doesn't offer any online play. Your gaming experience is just those 6 episodes. Although more ""Episodes"" will be arriving soon in the form of downloadable content(More on this later)Another thing I dislike about the game, is that many of the ""Action"" segments take place in the woods. Now during the first 2 ""Episodes"", that was kind of cool! The woods are a scary, and creepy and offer plenty of places for monsters to hide. After awhile though? Come on! It gets old! There's only so much running around trees a person can do before they start to lose interest! Once they get bored of the same repeating settings, then they are going to start getting bored of the game!The next negative? Well, that would be the ending! Now, I am not going to include any spoilers for anyone, but what I am going to say is that the ending is lame. It's one of the worst game endings ever. It doesn't even seem like an ending at all really! There's so much just left hanging and in the air, and what little excuse of an ending there is just leaves you scratching your head dumbfounded.Now, granted! Maybe the ending wasn't really an ending, but instead left open to leave room for the downloadable content. Maybe the ""Huh?! Factor"" will be resolved with the coming episodes. Possibly. However, I feel that it's kind of a rip off. Like they sent out an unfinished product, expecting you to pay the amount that one would pay for a full length game, and instead they receive an unfinished game, and a code to get the next episode free, however the second DLC you are of course expected to buy. In essence, you have to pay AGAIN to finish the storyline that SHOULD have been finished in the final product! It's ridiculous! It's like they are trying to milk you out of more money than their game title is actually worth.Yes, I know other companies have DLC as well, and to be honest, some of them I think are ridiculous, for instance the modern warfare DLC map package.However, some companies like Rockstar actually provide QUALITY DLC items! For instance Grand Theft Auto IV actually finished! It had an ending, then they released 2 other DLC packs that contained whole new storylines, that were connected to the first, but could be played separately and enjoyed and felt that you had a quality gaming experience with an actual ending.Would I recommend the game? I would recommend renting it. Like I said, it's a pleasurable game, but it's also a quick game! You probably will finish it during a rental period and most likely won't have a need to replay it since there's no real online play to extend the replay value.",3,Decent game with many pluses and negatives.,1278374400,"07 6, 2010"

Then we have Princess Garnet (Dagger), a young teenage girl, with a little knowledge of how the world outside her castle functions, but as their journey expands, she will gain the right and proper knowledge of how things should rightfully be. Steiner, what can I say? the ever faithful and loyal bodyguard of Garnet, this man has given me quite some laughs throughout the game. Eiko, a little brad, in her own right, she secretly desire Zidane, but with the princess in the way, she's blocked from ever getting him (damn you Garnet..hehe). Amarant, the solitairy guy who joins the party after he lost to Zidane in a battle, very little is know about his past, he seems very harsh but as you will see, he really has a soft spot. And then theres Quina, a chef, a big mama with a huge fork, although we really don't know if she's a male or a female. S/he joins the party to gain knowledge of the many recipies and munchies of the world, s/he's given me so many laughters, she is truly a gem in the world of the Final Fantasy. And at last, the ever loving Vivi, I've been emotionally moved by this little guy, he's seeking the reason of his existence, only to the discover the horrific truth of his doomed race, If I would say more about him, it spoil everything for you. The game has many, many places to explore and I doubt you'll find them all the first time, so many secret places, so many optional bosses, but hey no complains from this human, I simply adore it. Another reason why I love this game so much, is the beautifully detailed enviroments, I was completely convinced, that this game is the most beautiful graphically Final Fantasy game ever. Another reason why love is because of the disspoinment I suffered, while watching Final Fantasy 8, the game was terrible. Although I really enjoyed Final Fantasy 7, it had some very lovable characters.

In fact, when it comes to anything by Super Mario, this would be ranked in the top 10. It's so fun the way the stage is set up when you fight an enemy. Mario and his friends has many great moves that can help him in his battles. You get to run around the map and talk to people, and some people say some funny things. The game is set up differently than other Super Mario games that are normally played, but at the same time, it's still fun.The problem I have with this game is the mass amount of dialogue. Yes, this game is sort of like a storybook, but it gets real boring after a while. In fact, after you beat a boss and get a Crystal Star, expect a 20 minute dialogue of reading, and it;s usally about nothing at all. That is the only problem that I have with this game. And sometimes, it's hard to figure out where to go next (and that guy who lives in Ancient Rockport doesn't always help you out), so that gets real frustrating. But overall a fun game.

Borderlands 2 itself is an excellent game that deserves 5 starts. If you want to read a review of it there are many good ones under PS3 or X360 version.Let's keep the review short:The good: a full game, comes with all DLC so far, and it's enjoyable as always. Co-op is here, even though it is reduced to 2-men. Cross save is a nice touch, I can just use my max level characters from PS3.The bad: The graphic quality is just OK. I'm not expecting console quality but even for a handheld game it is very muddy and the texture resolutions are reduced drastically to accommodate the VITA's ability. Some changes are very noticeable such as enemies just vanish into a blood stain when they die. Sound quality also suffers. Music, voice over and sound effects are noticeably low bit-rate.These issues I can tolerate, however frame rate issue is a DEAL BREAKER. I played the beginning part of the game to Sanctuary, which is roughtly 40 minutes of play time. The majority of time the FPS is below 30, probably around 20 per my guessing. Low FPS in first person shooter makes me feel dizzy. Also it even lags at times, for instance you shoot a bullet to an enemy 10 meters away, roughly 0.5 second later you see a ""critical hit"" pops up. This should happen as soon as you pull the trigger. Hiccups are here and there: when you pass a save point, when multiple enemies in the screen, even when you bring out your character menu, you notice a small slow down.I was really looking forward to enjoy my handheld borderlands experience, but the technical issues, specifically the frame rate issue, made me regret making the purchase. Unless you have not experienced the game at all, I won't recommend you picking this up, at least not a full price $39.99.",2,A poor port.

No more media center support!!!Why would they remove such a great feature?I have Windows 7 & Windows 8 machines and used the Xbox as sort of a cable box.I do not have Satellite or CableTV (not worth the price), so I have an antenna, network tunner and use a PC to DVR with.

Before I could use just like a DVR and was great.MS has decided it's better to make cable companies happy and remove the feature and just let you hook a cable box to the HDMI input. Well that forces those of us without providers to not have as much use.Had I known I wouldn't have upgraded.Worse is, I get HBO Go for free with my internet (no TV box etc. still, just online portion I get) and 6+ months later I still can't watch it on the XBOX, despite during release they bragged how it would be out.The old XBOX could also be used as a cable box for AT&T;, Xfinity and Verizon to save on box fee's, but with the new box all the providers have backed out because of MS they just say hook your box to the HDMI if you want to &#34;integrate&#34;, never mind the point was to avoid further costs...For gaming though it's a great system.

At first I had fun with storyline, making dungeons, characters, and naming and making enemies, items, and all that. I titled it, chose the opening theme, and stuff. I test played it and found out how hard it was to make this game. A great game like Final Fantasy series, Xenogears, Chrono Cross or Breath of Fire series must take ages to make because this is the most time-consuming game I have ever played.The graphics are very NESish, and old, but I liked them at the beginning. Then I got very annoyed with them and how old they looked. It was like I was playing a classic Zelda game, or the great PS1 game Tales of Destiny. I quickly grew bored with this game. Check out some other reviews, one guy from Chicago tells all that I cannot type for my hands are very tired. I had fun at first but it all gradually fell down on me and I gave it up. The Anime Maker is very difficult to use and Scenario mode is even harder. A very very difficult game; you'll need a strategy guide for this but of course they don't make one. They include 2 instruction booklets in the CD case that are even difficult to understand. The magic system is horrible and it is all too confusing and hard.

Just admit you are not into shooter games anymore and move along to RPG. No true shooter finds playing against A.I. characters with a story challenging or fun. If you find this fun you must also find fun in hunting deer as they are easy and predictable as well. Now with that out of the way if you are into shooter games and like a challenge then Titanfall is where it's at. No it is not like Ghosts or BF4 like most of these people are saying. They say this because they don't want to buy the game. How do I know this? Because I have some friends who use the same reasons to not buy the game. I know they are full of it. If you try to play Titanfall with the same Ghosts style then you will lose. Titanfall plays vertical not just horizontal and there is a serious learning curve to get out of your normal COD style of play that most have become accustomed to. You basically need to &#34;Free Your Mind&#34;, and start using running on walls, hanging on walls, wall jumping to your advantage. Another plus, Capture The Flag is back and done right. It hasn't been done this good since Halo 2. The vast amount of play space in this game compared to Ghosts makes it feel like a real battlefield scenario. Go into buildings and your back into that same close quarter feel that Ghosts gave you. I would also like to mention that this game has a lot of room for new content and new maps. I actually cannot wait until a new map pack or game mode is released compared to Ghosts or BF4 where every new update was always the same or a map was just re done. By the 4th map pack release on COD or BF I wasn't even playing the game anymore because a new shooter was already out by that time. If you really want to compare Titanfall to another shooter then you would compare it to Unreal Tournament. It shares more with that game than it does COD or BF. All in all this is a great &#34;FPS&#34; game that I bought at midnight launch from BestBuy and thats why it does not show verified purchase.

My quest is: Do you want to suffer through the first couple hours of a game before it 'gets better,' or do you want to play something that is fun from the start?  Personally, I would rather play something fun.  Even those games which are complicated and take a while to get into tend to be at least enjoyable from the start.  If a game takes time to get into there needs to be an incentive to keep playing until it does.  With Two Worlds I spent that time staring at my television in dumb shock that something quite this bad had managed to be released in the first place... let alone get a special edition.Horrible control, frequent hitches and freezes, terrible music and voice acting, unreadable fonts and menus you have to squint to see no matter how nice your television are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to problem with this game.  (Imagine you can't read the description for your new piece of armor because instructions telling you to press the back button for instructions to navigate the menu are obscuring half of it.  Are you going keep a game with a problem like that?)  I spent as much time frozen as I did playing the game and this was on a new 360 which has never frozen or even glitched momentarily before and still plays all other games perfectly.Like many others, I purchased this because I was curious.  I saw bad reviews and knew that I often liked games with 'mixed reviews.'  The major review sites have, for the most part, said the game is good.  (I really do wonder if they are playing the same thing.)  I did not want and was not expecting Oblivion.  That is why I am writing this now.  Do not buy this game.  If you simply must try it, PLEASE find some way to rent it first.  Also, if you played the PC version and liked it okay, please get the PC version.  It is better than the 360 one, which is abysmal.  I tried to enjoy this game, I kept putting it back in the 360 hoping I could squeeze an itty bitty amount of fun out of my special edition.  Alas, it was impossible.If only I had never opened the box so I could get my money back.  I would feel guilty reselling it.  (If nothing else I have said has convinced you not to buy the game!)

I decided to purchase this workout ""game"" because I am a fan of the show, and right now the gym is always slammed... so I wanted something to do at home.  This was my first pick for an interactive trainer that would make home fitness more fun.  Well, after two workouts I'm very hesitant to even say I would recommend this product.  DISCLAIMER: I am fully aware that this is not a game, and I will not review it as such.Upon starting up two things jump out at the user.  Graphics and Kinect only control.  The graphics are bad for this product, and there is no way around it.  This looks like something that belongs on an original Xbox.  That's okay though because I didn't pay full price, and being that I'm not viewing it as a game.. it didn't bother me.  Secondly, the menus.  I don't know what person was in charge of menus, but I hope they were reassigned.  The menus are EXTREMELY cumbersome and clunky.  It's infuriating to navigate the menus in this workout program.  You will be wishing you could use the controller more than ever.After starting up, you're prompted to do a fitness test.  You do this for 30 minutes, or until the game believes you're having a difficult time with an exercise.  After the test it recommends a program and difficultly.  Then you do the body scan.The body scan accuracy is not good if you have the Kinect placed on the wall angled down.  My numbers were not close.  I don't know if the numbers would be more accurate if I had the kinect level with the TV or not, but I'll assume it would.  After that, you can customize your program or jump right into a workout.This is where the game starts to become even worse and the misleading part comes in.  I went to customize my workout, and I wanted to add equipment as I have bands and free weights.  Well, there is NO option for free weights at all!  This was EXTREMELY disappointing as this was one of the major reasons I purchased this title.  I added res bands, and they weren't even used in the workout I did.  Which leads me to the next frustrating issue...I hope there are no Jillian fans out there.  I'm not a fan, but I chose both trainers because I wanted to experience both of them.  Well, big problem and to my surprise... I hear BOB and ONLY Bob bossing me around!  What?  I asked for Jillian AND Bob!  I see Jillian on the screen, yet I only hear Bob!  Every so often you'll hear Jillians voice saying ""Up, down"" or small things of that nature.  This is a Bob only workout.Finally, the workout is frustrating.  It has no flow.  I have times where I go down to the floor, stand up, floor... all for one exercise each.  It's stupid.  You don't do that when you workout.  If you go to the floor, you do more than one floor exercise before getting up.I can't recommend this product.
