11509,4196,A2TCG2HV1VJP6V,B000021Y32,Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...,"[0, 0]","To start off this review, let me tell you that I bought Mortal Kombat 4 for the Game Boy before 3. It had lousy AI, good graphics, bland music, semi-unresponsive controls, and 3 difficulty modes: Novice, Warrior, and Master. But, it was good enough to get 3 stars.What I found to be strange was that Mortal Kombat 3 on the Game Boy had several similarities to 4. The only differences are: Different characters and setting, badder music, and the controls a bit more unresponsive. Everything else seems to be the same. It's not like it's a direct sequel, is it? I mean, the MegaMan series always had the same gameplay sequel after sequel. But I don't recall Mortal Kombat series having the almost exact same things.The graphics are good. The characters are digitized, like how they were in the previous games.The gameplay, however, can be unresponsive.Like all other Game Boy Mortal Kombats, this game would be short. You only get to fight 9 characters in Master mode, 7 in Warrior, and 5 in Novice.The best attack to use is just kicking. That's kinda sad. Usually, the uppercut would be the best standard attack to use, but no. Instead, it's KICKING.However, even after all this, it would manage to have some appeal.Overall, it's alright, but if you want a great Mortal Kombat game for the Game Boy, buy MK2 instead.",2,Strangely like its sequel,1299369600,"03 6, 2011"

Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones really takes you back to what was so great about Sands of Time. One thing I really found enjoyable about this game was the story. You really find yourself attached to certain characters and it brings you into the game. Another great thing about this game is the gameplay, which again brings the player back to the greatness of Sands of Time. One thing I fing great is all the action that is encountered throughout the game. Having the ability to sword slash through enemies gives this game a nice balance. Without this, the game would be purely platform and while this could be fun, it definetely needs the action to keep it feeling alive. The ability to use the quick kills is also very entertaining. The bosses in the game are also fantastic. Each of them are very different in the way you fight them which is something I found to help keep the game fresh. Some are very platform feeling the way you fight, and others are much more action quick kill like. Another cool addition in The Two Thrones is the Dark Prince. Although at times he seems a bit overpowered, the addition of him was well needed and made the game very fun. Overall, I thought this game brought back the feel of Sands of Time and although it still lacks slightly in gameplay than the first, it is still great and definetley better than Warrior Within.PresentationThe story is great and keeps the player attached to this game. It is truly back to its roots and people who liked Sands of Time are going to love this game.GraphicsThe graphics in this game are very nice and the environments are fantastic.SoundThe voice acting in this game is fantastic! The music is also great and definitely creates a nice mood for the game.GameplayThe gameplay is great! I love the quick kills and they truly add a new demention to the game.Lasting AppealThe game feels a bit short, can be beat in 7-10 hours. Although there are unlockables, there isn't that much incentive to play through the game all the way through a second time.",4,WOW!!!,1147651200,"05 15, 2006"

But out of all of them this proves to be the best.  It has a GTA style gameplay but with awesome familer simpson environments.  You can stop in the Quick-E-Mart or go into the simpson household.  You can unlock cool raceing mini games which you can do multile players on.  The graphics are the best for a simpsons title.  The driveing is good and it has some pretty funny stuff in it.  You hav to do stuff in the town called gags and some of them are just plain funny.  You also collect cards, you do missions and even bonus missions.  You also have to kill these bee cameras so there's quite of bit of stuff to do.  There are only like 4 different types of missions like raceing, running somebody down,  get stuff to check point a to check point b and stuff like that.  You play as Homer, Bart, Lisa, Marge, and Apu and they have there own environment in springfield so you see everything.  Definitly check this title out if you even slightly like the simpsons.  This game is definitly a good buy, and trust me it's way better then simpsons skateboarding.",4,BEST SIMPSONS GAME EVER!,1091577600,"08 4, 2004"

Above all that the frame rate is awful, every minor load will slow or stop the game for 1-3 seconds, the audio from time to time will feel off, sometimes you'll hear an explosion from your grenade well after it already blew up. Overall this game had serious potential, i wanted to love this game, i waited since june for this release and was very disappointed.Pros: Current story with elements of the war on terrorism,The Shooting controls work well.Cons: Framerate holds you back from enjoying the game,the squad commands are not well utilized, Short campaign (6-7 hrs)",2,This is why Area 51 is kept secret,1198108800,"12 20, 2007"

All done for more marketing sales to make Microsoft very happy of course and to squeeze every last dime out of Halo fans by creating three types of editions. I was there for the midnight release and played Halo3 for a good two and half hours until I crashed out on my couch. I'll break this review down into a few cat orgies.Gameplay: The game to me has improved on many levels. With new enemies with better AI, they don't just stand there waiting to get killed. Along with the same layout has Halo 1&2, 3 is pretty much the same (point, shoot, cover), but you have more areas to get creative with new content. Halo3 gameplay was given a polished look and finish and even though it can feel old at times, it's really all about finishing the fight and finding out the storyline.Graphics: I was quit surprised to see how clean and detailed the graphics were on my regular TV. Bungie really went to attention to detail and left nothing out. I have a 24' HDTV but with no speakers so I have to resort to my older TV, but if Halo3 looks as good as it does on regular, I can only image what it would look like HD.New Content: Who doesn't like new content? Halo3 has more to offer then ever. There is new equipment to help you defeat your foes when it gets rough. New guns, new fighting tactics, its awesome.Overall: I gave this 4 stars out of 5 because the gameplay feels the same in certain parts of the game, but with the graphics and new content I can easily get over it. Only reason why I got an Xbox 360 was for Halo3, since I found out there was no plans to start working on a PC version of Halo and I didn't want to wait long to play.Advice: Don't play Halo 3 until you played Halo 1&2, get familar with the storyline and controls, otherwise this game won't be ""the hype"" you expected. Remember, when Halo first came out, there was mixed reviews, playing Halo 3 first is no exception.",4,Overdone hype but awsome game.,1190678400,"09 25, 2007"

I wanted to leave my ps4 upstairs and use the vita to play from my room. If you leave my room the stairs are 10 feet away. The ps4 is at the top of the stairs. I would think it could reach this short distance. I ended up moving the ps4 downstairs to my room, and then tested remote play from my bathroom. My bathroom is inside my room, the ps4 is inside my room, it was still out of range. Do you need line of site for this thing to work? Do I literally have to be sitting right in front of my ps4?? Why on earth would anyone want to do that? On top of that, you can't use video apps like netflix or hulu for some reason.. I don't see why it can't stream video. As a remote play device, it is a complete and total failure. It's a shame too because it's actually quite impressive when it works.

It tries to be some type of Steven King/horror/movie/game, and I'm not even sure if it succeeds or fails at that, but either way it's a very boring and repetitive game.  This game feels like it should have come out five years ago, but even if it had, it still would have been awful.The most annoying part is you have no idea what is going on the entire game. Struggle through your boredom to finish the game and you will still have no idea what transpired. The ending is short and resolves none of the baffling story. There is no closure or explanation of anything.The game isn't so much scary as it is confusing and tedious. The controls and gameplay are clunky. You spend the entire time trotting from place to place usually in the woods, shining flashlights at shadows and using a clunky revolver or rifle.This feels like a very old school game, with linear levels and horrible character development. Most of the characters introduced in the game you learn nothing about, and have virtually nothing to do with.Graphics and voice acting are both ok, but both could have been better.You will spend the whole game, reloading your flashlight and revolver to use on very repetitive shadows. Oh and you get to crank generators. Fun.Basic premise of the game = light is good darkness is bad.

124,191299,A25JUE9AFX7SUC,B005C2D2MO,Matthew,"[5, 10]","I'm not a huge stealth-game person. Try something, get spotted, reload. Try again and reload again. Hundreds of times. I'll only play a stealth game if it is really good. At FIRST this seemed to be that game. As I came close to finishing the game, I realized that this game is basically broken if you are playing it stealthy.There are a few problems and bugs with the game, I can overlook those. However:(minor spoilers)At the end of each level of the game, you are given a score on how well you did and asked if you want to re-try, if you killed anyone or if anyone saw you, how much money you got and which collectibles. On a mission about 1/2 of the way through the game, this score told me I had killed someone. I had NOT killed anyone. I looked up online and found out that just one death would affect the end of the game. I could have replayed the level, but each level is quite long and I don't do what I call ""boring work"" in games. If a game says I should do ""boring work"", like replaying an entire level for no reason, I say ""no"". If the game decided (somehow) that I killed someone, then it should have TOLD ME AT THE TIME, and I could have reloaded a save during the game. I do not know how anyone died, since I never killed anyone.So I continued the game, angry at it but accepting that I was screwed out of the best possible ending.A couple of levels later, I was told at the end of a mission that someone had seen me. No one had. NO ONE HAD SEEN ME. But it said someone had and would I enjoy the pleasure of many hours of ""boring work"" replaying the level, especially when I would have no idea if/when someone would magically ""see"" me again. My response again was ""no, I don't want the BORING WORK of replaying the level"". However, I did keep playing the game since I was almost done.The final level. I took the time sneaking around, choking people (not killing them) and hiding bodies in places that the game could not reasonably say anyone would find them (for example: in vents that are under the floor). Then a bunch of guards come out of a door and start searching around for an ""intruder"". I assume one of the guys I choked was discovered (under the floor...), or maybe I was ""seen"" while I was under the floor. Or who knows, maybe the guy I choked unconscious had died, and I was seen while I was under the floor hiding a dead body!Whatever. I quit the game, on the last level, and have no intention of ever playing it again.BTW, any game I quit playing I give a very low rating. I consider such a game to possess the same level of failure as a movie that I walk out on. The fact that this game has so much to like about it (and there IS a lot of quality in this title) does not mean it deserves a higher score. Also, I only review things that either I strongly disagree with the prevailing opinion (like this game), or that don't already have many reviews.",2,"Amazing at first, but flaws ruin the fun before it ends.",1366416000,"04 20, 2013"

612,30171,A21XZF5ZHKK5EM,B000069BD9,"Antoinette Johnson ""Pooky""","[0, 0]","Mortal Kombat is my absolute favorite fighting franchise. When deadly Alliance came out I knew I wanted it and it didn't disappoint. Me and my sister used to spend lots of time playing this together and it was alot of fun. It does have its flaws though, but I'll adress them while I show some of its features. Its been awhile since I've played this one, so I'll try to put as much info as I can.1. Profile: Given that this was my first 3d MK game I'm not sure if profile is a new feature or not. All you do is start a profile and make your own password. Through this you can buy extras and new characters by earning coins in Konquest mode or Arcade fight. If you play with two players you can bet on coins through fights with each other. Your progress is automatically saved when you ext your profile.2. Konquest: I have mixed feelings on Konquest. Konquest is a good way to earn coins, but it suffers some flaws. For one Konquest is technically nothing but training, except you're going through different stages and to move on you must master the fighting technique of the character you're faced off with. This becomes a problem later on with certain characters like Raiden. When you have to masterthe more complex combos, the controls won't always respond making so you have to go back to the first fighting style and start over. What makes it an even bigger pain in the ass is that sometimes you do execute the combo, but the game won't let you move on because the last attack in the combo didn't hit the computer. That ruined the experience alot for. I can't begin to name the countless hours I spent on Raidens 3 part combos because it wouldn't execute properly no matter how good my timing was. Konquest also gets kind of boring after awhile which is why I'm happy Deception added more to it. To be honest I still haven't passed all of Konquest because of these flaws.Arcade: The highlight of every MK game is the arcade. The Kombat is how you expect it. Every character has a special move they execute by pressing R1. You fight in 3d rendered areas, but you're limited to a small space by invisible walls. I don't really like that. It would be cool if you had more free ranges to fight. Luckily later games got rid of this. Some levels have special obstacles are trapps you can use for a fatality or to damage yoour opponent which is a cool addition to the series. Between certain stages you get a bonus minigame where you test your might or sight. Test you Sight is way easier the Might. In test your sight there are cups in front of you that move around. You are shown where the coin is under and have to find which cup has it.Krypt: The krypt is scattered with coffins that are label with a set amount of coins. Be careful though because some coffins are empty. The hardest coins to achieve are the Onyx and Silver coins. If my memory serves me, the only way to earn both coins is either konquest or test your might or sight, so collecting them is a hassle due to thier rarety. I remember having tons of Saphire, Jade, Gold, and Ruby coins but barely of them two.Deadly alliance for its time was a fun 3d Mortal Kombat. What keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the fact that compared to Deception which is my favorite of the series Deadly Alliance is kind of dull. Konquest is linear, Arcade is fun but stages are small and bland, and controls are a little flawed. Despite this if you're an MK fan its still worth a buy.

I am a huge fan of the original Rayman that was released for the Playstation, but I haven't actually enjoyed the series since. Rayman 2 just didn't click for me. I took one look at Raving Rabids and thought I would never play the series again. Then, when Rayman Origins came out, I thought there might be a chance for me to get back into the Rayman universe. Unfortunatley I didn't like the art style of the characters, and the gameplay in the demo was really boring to me. Fast forward to now...and Rayman Legends is what I've been waiting for since the original Rayman.Rayman origins looked kind of like a Ren and Stimpy episode with beautiful animated backgrounds done with Flash animation. Rayman Legends looks like a modern side-scroller should look. The background artwork has been seriously kicked up a notch, and everything has a more 3D effect. It's a bit like some of the better animated films that have 3D and 2D combined, giving us a gorgeous side-scrolling animated world that seems like a living, breathing place. How good is it? It's better than Castle of Illusion HD, better than Outland, better and Shadow Complex. It just MIGHT be the most beautiful side scroller ever made. True, it feels a lot like a downloadable game on Xbox Live, but I doubt any Xbox Live downloadable side-scroller would have quite this much polish put into it.Where what I played of Rayman Origins felt kind of bland and forgettable, this game sucks you in and begs you to progress just a little further.

I still liked this game, but I kept expecting HERinteractive to step it up.Story-Bess and George's Aunt Bet and Uncle Ed invite you (along with Bess and George) to their ranch in Arizona.  When you arrive, Bess, George, Aunt Bet, and Uncle Ed are all not there; and the hired hands won't tell you anything.  You soon find out that a ""phantom horse"" has been showing up, and everytime it shows up something bad happenns.  The latest catastrophe is that Uncle Ed got bitten by a rattlesnake and had to go to the ER.Graphics-Just a little bit better.  I keep expecting it to just get WOW better, but it never does.  The lips actually match the words much better, though.Sound-Along with that, the voice acting for one of the characters you talk to is fabulous, while the other three characters seem bored.  This is actually the first game where I felt some voice actors/actresses weren't giving it their all.  The music is country which I didn't really like or dislike.  It went with the story, so that was good enough for me.Gameplay-Everything is the same (first person; point-and-click; etc.) except you get around via horse.  It actually takes longer than in other games, and it can get quite boring.  Another boring thing are the ""puzzles.""  Half of the puzzles are chores such as getting the eggs, feeding the horses, etc.  It's not brain-challenging at all, and for this reason I gave the ""fun rating"" 3 stars.Fun-Like I said this game is OK, but the puzzles aren't really fun.  The story is fun, though, expecially the back story with Bess and George, but the puzzles are just work.  I hate work.Length-This game is about 10 hours straight through.  However, I wish they would have taken out the chores even if it resulted in lowering the game to 8 hours.  Seriously, the chores take about 2 hours in total.A good game that has boring puzzles.

The visuals were tightened up a little and so was the sticky button for cover, minimizing unintended  and ponderous cover moves.  Other than that, it's kinda short, barely longer than the original.  One more star could have been given for my review but for a couple glaring flaws.  First - there are too may times where I was missing the contextual button cue to do something and died constantly wondering, ""What the heck do they want me to do?""  Really lazy game design.  Second,  there is a point toward the end where I just wanted to stop playing because of how repetitive it was.  It's pretty disappointing with enemy variety because they end up sticking you up against the Reavers (Bullet sponge mofos on Nightmare) over and over and over and over and...You get the idea.  You can extended the game by playing on Nightmare, as Hardcore really isn't all that hard, but Nightmare is pretty merciless - your mileage may vary.  On the weapon front, there's a hand full of new ones like the flamethrower and the weird mortars,  but you'll still be using the lancer most of the time to grind out Locust with the evergreen head shot master Longshot now and then.SPOILERSThe saving grace really is the end.  They junk the all too tired cliche of the end boss (Raam really was a weak way to end the first game) and instead, you go on a totally hilarious steam rolling driving a Brumack.  The problem is, the ending deserved a better game.  Sure there's chainsaws, Carmines and Dom kills his wife - which I found to be unintentionally funny - but despite the polish, this one is barely longer than the first, has a better ending, but none of the freshness.  The boss encounters - like the one lifted from Resident Evil 4 on the lake - aren't well though out and in the online component, I never liked multiplayer in any of the Gears so this one is no exception.  Learn to love the shotty because that is all you will see.  Horde mode wasn't a great idea because that is essentially what the rest of the game is.  You roll around shooting until the enemies stop coming.End SpoilersFor $20 this is a great buy - bar none worth the purchase.

But in the end, I quit playing it because it just wasn't for me.  At this price, and as fantastic as the game looks, it might be worth a try, especially if you are a fan of the Action genre.  I was hoping it would be a crossover for me, since I do like some Action game elements, but in the end I just don't get excited enough about different combos and finisher moves to master all the button sequencing.  I really prefer mastering a bigger variety of spells or weapons and using stealth or situational tactics over the constant gladiator-style, non-stop fighting with the same weapon against wave after wave of enemies.Pros:- Fantastic graphics- Intense, virtually non-stop, bloody as hell action- Immersive experience going into Hell to beat it and win- Based on a classic book and fairly true to the concept- Very memorable imagery and themes- Puzzles are goodCons:- Emphasis is on learning button sequencing and proper timing for different combos and finishers (not my thing; if this appeals to you, this game would be excellent)- Linear path and really only one way to succeed (there is no stealth option or alternate paths)- Can only save the game at certain save pointsI can see where this would be a 5-star game for gamers who love Action games like God of War.  I was hoping that it would have cross-over appeal for RPG'ers like me.  The concept and imagery did work and appeal to me, but there is not enough flexibility in gameplay to make it fun for me.

10770,110192,AGCDNTPBJ8JTG,B001BNFQKO,Robbie,"[107, 125]","Let me preface my review with a brief story: When GTA IV came out in May for consoles, I purchased a brand new PS3 just to play it. To this day it's the only game I own for my PS3, which sits largely unused but as a testament to Rockstar's masterpiece. I'm not much of a console gamer, but Sony and Rockstar made well over $500 from me on the release of GTA IV alone... but after seeing this incredible mess pushed out I do not think I'll ever purchase another Rockstar product.I suppose it's also important to say I have not actually purchased GTA IV for PC, although I do have firsthand experience with this travesty. A good friend of mine called me over the weekend and asked if I wouldn't mind taking a look at his computer, because according to him, his rig was running GTA IV very slow. When I arrived I could hardly believe this product was from the same company I gave my money to.Everything you read here is accurate. SecuROM, with or without ""teeth,"" is always to the detriment of honest consumers and here it is in full effect. But not satisfied with that, Rockstar apparently made it possible to play the game if and only if you agree to Byzantine Windows Live and Rockstar Social Club contracts. That is frankly unacceptable by any standard. And to top it off, on a computer with a Quad-Core, two 8800 Ultras in SLI, and 8 (yes, eight) GB of RAM the game runs worse than it ever did on my PS3. And it looks about the same. For a game developer, the words ""code optimization"" mean very little to Rockstar.Perhaps the most heinous injustice about this whole shameful affair is the warning included that, summarized, warns ""... most current hardware will not be able to run this game at high settings."" Unbelievable. When did releasing games, especially games which ran acceptably well on inferior consoles, incomplete with a requirement to spend hundreds more dollars on future hardware become acceptable? To me that is the lowest form of terrible work ethic and is the main reason I feel I cannot buy another Rockstar product ever again. Is it not enough to completely ruin a product by making the consumer sign away his privacy just to play it? When did Crysis, whose infamy cannot even measure up to this abomination, become the golden standard for a successful game release? If the market into which you're releasing your product is ""unprepared"" for the ""requirements"" of said product, then there is something wrong with your product, not the market.But here Rockstar really shot itself in the foot because the game has already been proven to run, with over 10 million witnesses, on inferior hardware. I told my friend to get his money back and now I'm thinking of selling my PS3. The most successful PC games have always been the ones that are not laden with malware and actually run on consumers' PCs. PC gaming is in dire straits if the biggest developers think people actually want to have to deal with insurmountable mountains of red tape just to play a video game. It's a video game- nothing less, but especially nothing more. Playing GTA IV on PC is worth far less to me than the actual time it would take to accomplish said goal.I consider myself a Grand Theft Auto fan. I played GTA IV an unhealthy amount over the summer. But merely seeing this stillbirth of a title that Rockstar threw onto PC gamers makes me realize I can live without. Do not purchase this under any circumstances. It is far cheaper, in terms of money and life lost in frustration, to buy a new console to play GTA IV. If you want a new PC game, I recommend the excellent Left 4 Dead or any other title by Valve. I beseech you not to give money to companies who treat their costumers like this.Rockstar, you have released an utterly pathetic excuse for a personal computer game. I hate to say this is another nail in the proverbial coffin for PC gaming, but even I feel a little dismayed that almost every new title for computers is burdened with SecuROM, doesn't run well on hefty hardware, or is some unholy combination of the two. In short, Rockstar has taken everything that is ""killing"" PC gaming and mixed it into one completely miserable experience.

If, however, you're looking for a game with character development and a good story line with  intricate details and subplots, then you probably won't enjoy this game  very much.  I've played all of the Might and Magic games, except for the  first two, and even the earlier M&amp;M games were better than this.The  quests and storyline are very cliche'.

488,210978,A2G44NES0MQOAC,B0094H8H7I,pennywyze,"[1, 2]","First off, my wife bought this console for me this past Christmas and apparently she got it from Toys R' Us. A few weeks beforehand, I had actually glanced at this product and didn't know what to make of it being that when I did a search about this console, there was nothing to see. I even saw this console featured on Gamester81 of Youtube and for some reason he thought it was ok. Here are my honest thoughts about it alongside an indepth review.Graphics-To start things off, the graphics are terrible. I've even tried this console on a regular CRT and the graphics are either too ""sharp, pixellated and blurry"" or they lack detail altogether.While I wasn't expecting Genesis style graphics, I certainly didn't think the games would look this bad, especially if you compare it to a regular genesis.The colors are very washed out and the console comes with a standard AV mono cable which is not required for use. In fact, you can use any AV cable and the console will work fine.Once you boot the console, there's a ""menu"" that displays all games included which I'll get into later.Overall, no matter if you use an LCD, HDTV, LED or CRT, the graphics for this console are amongst the worst of any clone console.Sound-As if the graphics weren't one of the biggest problems, along comes the sound; and it is terrible.None of the genesis games have proper music and the sound emulation is way off. Playing even games like Sonic 1 or the included Shinobi 3 will treat your ears to the worst sound emulation to date.This was possibly the worst aspect about this console that makes me not like it even more. The only games with somewhat decent sound would be the other ""40 games"" included with the collection.Functionality/control/perks/add-ons etc-This console is small. About the size of a Genesis 3 though a tad smaller. It's very lightweight and it comes with two wireless controllers that use AAA batteries, an AV cable and an AC adapter. It has a power and reset button. One of the better features about this console would be the fact that you can plug your genesis controller in the console rather than use it's wireless controllers and the fact that you can use original genesis cartridges with the console.The bad part about using original genesis carts with this console is the fact that the emulation still stinks and your cart is extremely hard to take out.Now, I'll get into the games that are included which are ok, but I often wonder why the better genesis games like Aladdin or Alien Soldier are never included in any collection. It's always Sonic games or Streets of Rage. A typical collection. There are some games worth noting however-Included are- Sonic 1, 2, Golden Axe 1, 2, 3, Ristar, E-Swat, Shadow Dancer, Shinobi 3, Streets of Rage 1, 2 and 3, Alex the Kidd, Kid Chameleon, Chakan the forever man, Comix Zone, Alien Storm, Arrow Flash, Columns, Bonanza Brothers, The Ooza, Sonic and Knuckles, Vectorman 1 and 2, Decap Attack, Ecco, Virtua Fighter 2, Sonic 3d blast, Crack Down, Flicky and a few more.Also included are a bunch of Chinese knock off titles like Chess, a fkae pong and bunch of other games (even a ripoff frogger title) that aren't worth playing at all.The box says ""80 games"" with Sonic on it's cover and touts the games being Genesis games while it includes 40 genesis games and 40 other games.My final verdict would be to avoid this console at all costs.The graphics are terrible (my Genesis 1 looks and sounds ALOT better than this console even on an LCD TV), THE SOUND IS atrocious. The controllers are cheaply made and while it does give you an option to use an original genesis controller and cart....why bother when the graphics and sound are so bad?!This console doesn't even deserve 2 stars, but I gave it two because it can use the genesis controller.For the current price of 50 bucks on Amazon...I AM SHOCKED!!!

I got them from three places that had buy two get one free deals.  This was one of the games I got.  It is a lot of fun.  You can customize your character, cart and even make your own tracks.  You have to get so many things on each track to total a number to move on to the next set of tracks.  It was a lot of fun.  Then I got to about the middle of track set 4 and the begging of 5.  The game has lost its entertainment.  There are way to many things happening on the screen at once for me to be able to pay attention to.  One level has traffic lights on fire swinging back and forth, other racers shooting stuff at you as well as you having to worry about going off the track and trying to get the goals you need for the set goals.  I can't even hear the music when playing the later levels.  It is like everything blends into one mess.  Sometimes only on these later levels, it feels like I am not the one controlling my racer.  My car will just bug out and go in a completely opposite direction than I am holding the stick down to go.  I will be in first, then all of a sudden everyone comes at me and hits me with everything and I am in last.  Hello Mario Kart!!!!  As I said, this game was a lot of fun.  But these past tracks have been annoying.  If I say this is one of the games I got free, I will just keep it.  But I want to play the PS3 version.  The game is fun.

We had a lot of fun playing Midnight Club and Need for Speed. Honest to God, once when he was about 3 and we were racing, he said, ""Mom, do you have a pair of scissors?"" I said, ""Huh?!"" Then he chortled and said, ""Because I'm going to cut you off!"" and he did!!!So, when I purchased this, my hope was that we could again enjoy playing ""Need for Speed"" together, as in one as the cop, one as the criminal, race via split screen. Nope. This doesn't support split screen or co-op play.It doesn't seem to connect via a normal Xbox Live account either, but requires a specific/separate EA Games account (which, whenever you start the game you're prompted for and have to skip if you don't).Beyond that, as just a one player racing game, it's still pretty fun. The courses and objectives are challenging and even in just the first sector which we've unlocked, there are about 10 different courses, each with a subsection of various missions.It works extremely well with a force feedback steering wheel (surprising that all racing games don't?).As a racing game by itself, it's really good, but I sincerely miss having the split-screen option since I still love playing video games along side my son and don't intend to buy another Xbox and Xbox live account to sit in another room just to play together (defeats the purpose, no?).",2,"Not 2 player, needs it's own EA Games account????",1383955200,"11 9, 2013"

1543,136604,A3VN0U04DY7MEA,B002I0GY9G,MrFoxhound,"[6, 6]","I realize that launch games need to be taken with a grain of salt. After all, most launch games are afterthoughts that companies put out at the eleventh hour and are on brand new hardware that they might not be comfortable with, but that really doesn't make up for this game's many, many faults.The only good I had with this game was the sound. The Death Metal soundtrack is fantastic, and a really under-utilized genre as far as video game music goes. This game has crunchy tunes that really set the stage for the King of Hell to go about his business.Unfortunately, it's all downhill after that. Think of this game as Pikmin on an acid trip. That's exactly what it is, sans growing Pikmin, exploration or any kind of unique, fun or strategic battles. This is a bare-bones copy of Pikmin that has zero frills attached to it. You start the game as the King of Hell who has been cast down from his throne. You need to get your throne back, but you can't directly attack enemies yourself, that would be un-er-kingly. So, instead you employ little goblins to do the attacking, and dying, for you.There are three basic types of goblins in this game: Soldier Class, Spearman Class and Magic Class. You're soldiers are basically your grunts, vast and expendable. This unit will lead the charge most of the time. You throw this class onto the backs of enemies until you get enough to unleash a Salvo attack that will do massive damage to the enemy, but also causes all your minions to fall off the enemy demanding you to throw them back on. Most enemies other than bosses, won't live up to more than two of these Salvo attacks. The Spearman Class can line up in formations that you can then propel along the ground to do massive damage when they hit, or a long recoil effect when they miss. The Magic Class hurls magic from afar, and when you line up this group, you also get a noticeable increase to your walking speed.You can collect ingredients from every enemy minus the lowest class ones. That means any enemy that you can do a Salvo attack on, you will collect an item from. Items can be used to synthesize armor and weapons for your minions, as well as items to help in battle and armor for yourself, the King of Hell. It's pretty impossible to farm these items as they all seem like random drops, which means, it'll be hard to go back to a specific level just to farm an ingredient that you need for a weapon or armor piece that you want to upgrade on your minions.The game boasts 40 stages, although the credits roll after Stage 20, but this game is such a chore. Every environment is bland with the same color scheme. And they are all floating islands, read: rings, in which you need to defeat all enemies to unlock the bridge to the next area. There is little to no exploration at all, and whatever miniscule amount of exploration there is, the game actually punishes you for exploring because it drops your overall score for more time used at the end of the stage result screen.The enemies are reused just as much as the environments are, even the bosses are repeats, just colored a different way to reflect a different attribute. That yellow minotaur that you fought 3 stages back, is now a red minotaur because he can spew flames.Overall, outside of the great soundtrack, there isn't much more to like about this game. It can be fun for a while, but eventually, even the most die hard supporter or Army Corps of Hell will tire of the same environments and enemies being bandied about and the paper thin story that is supposed to be the glue that holds this thing together.",2,Hell spat this game back out.,1343001600,"07 23, 2012"

The camera's cable is as long as it is and there is no promise that it will ever be extendable.I have to break my own rule here since I think this needs to be said.  Most people (myself included) who may need an extension for their camera didn't even give it a 2nd thought since the PS3 camera is so easily extendable with a standard USB 2.0 extension cable (available everywhere in every length and color imaginable).  Then we come to find out that they changed the connector end and have no official or unofficial statement about how they plan to handle the considerable amount of customers who need an extension for this device.  Many have returned the camera for this reason or have it sitting unused until someone steps up and solves this problem.  Others (like myself) are a little luckier because I can plug my camera into my PS4 BUT I have to plug it in every time I want to use it because all my equipment is inside a cabinet and also have to unplug it when I am done so the door will close.  With an extension, the cable will run behind my TV into the wiring channel that leads to inside the cabinet and I can leave it plugged in all the time.  Anyone who wants to trash me for this, I consider it fair game.  I won't defend myself.Please note that I waited until a month and a half after the release date to post this.  I wanted to give them some time to address to the issue.  I can excuse the fact that they (Sony) may not have been aware of how many people extended the PS3 camera since they didn't even sell extensions and tracking the sales of any USB extension cables would be silly since they can be used for tons of other reasons.  But they have certainly heard more than enough about this need by now.How about just a little hope (&#34;We are planning on releasing an extension cable for the PS4 camera in the near future&#34;).",1,Cable is too short!,1388016000,"12 26, 2013"

There are too many issues at the core of this game, there's hardly ever anyone online, every server I check says that the cities haven't been active in multiple weeks which completely undermines the multiplayer aspect, and the cities are just too darn small! Everytime my cities get really rollin and things finally start to get intereting I've run out of room with no where else to develop, that and not being able to modify or edit the terrain makes the whole experience very limited. This is a very broken game, get Simcity 3000 or 4 instead.)EA screwed this game up, lets get that out of the way. The always on DRM is a big problem and what is definitely hurting the game. I had to server-hop after installing the game to find a server where I could actually play. After I found a server that worked I played for quite some time and enjoyed the game. However I later on tried to log on to the same server and it now had a three hour wait, I switched servers and since the game's saves are cloud based when I logged on to the new server it treated it as though I had never played the game before, my cities were gone and the game forced me through its tutorial again.You can't really screw up Simcity, unless of course you force always on DRM onto it. So bravo EA and Origin, you broke Simcity, an unbreakable game.The actual game itself is beautiful and fun and is a more streamlined experience then previous installments, if you loved past Sim games you'll no doubt love this one. Were it not for the online problems I would give it 4 stars easy and the fact that the game IS enjoyable is the only thing stopping me from giving it one star.All that said I would hold off from buying it until the developers pull their heads from their hind quarters and fix their broken online system.

359,130807,AIMT3E7BNFZNX,B002BSC54I,Chance Lee,"[5, 6]","I've played every console Zelda game from the NES and Gameboy up to this one. I've even finished most of them! But this one I almost didn't. This is probably one of, if not my absolute, least favorite Zelda games. It's all the more disappointing, given how I expected this Wii outing to be spectacular.It takes waaay too long to get going. Nintendo hasn't crammed this much boring dialog into a game since Super Paper Mario. And the story is kind of lame. I mean, the people of Skyloft are really attached to these birds, right? Why don't they give them names? They act like they're important lifelong companions, almost like the daemons in Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy, but they can't do any more than call them ""my bird."" Storytelling has evolved, Nintendo. If you're going to put this much effort into it, do it right.And that's a major problem with this game. Instead of leaving it stuck in the past (I'll admit it, I was looking forward to a familiar Zelda adventure--chasing chickens, trading objects, getting items and solving dungeons. At least it did one part right), Nintendo tried to update it. In a misguided effort to catch up with video game advances made in the early 90s--mine carts, escort missions--Skyward Sword wastes too much time on the aspects of the game that are half-baked and not fun. It's ironic that Nintendo's attempts to modernizing Zelda in some way are what make it look most dated. The mine cart ride could not be more snooze-inducing. And the escort mission is so tedious and boring, I didn't even know they made them that way anymore. The skydiving is a nice new addition that is pretty much only used once, for a slightly fun mini-game.Speaking of tedious, good god, this game will walk you through every single thing that you don't need to know. In case you forgot, the game will remind you every single time what an Amber Relic or a Monster Claw is. It takes all the fun out of opening a giant chest. Remember the feeling you got when you found a giant chest? Link opens it, it glows magically, and you pull out a magical unique relic, a piece of heart, of a golden rupee? Well, after the ninth time you pull out a stinking piece of Eldin Ore, the large chests lose any sense of joy or suspense. I almost avoided them, not wanting to sit through the animation just to receive my 17th copy of an item that I no longer needed.The game isn't balanced well. You can buy every single item around half-way into the quest. After that, every upgrade to my wallet or giant rupee prize was completely pointless.At least the dungeons are fun. The dungeons are very well done, and visually striking too. I'm especially fond of the time-traveling desert dungeon. The past looks very futuristic and kind of black-velvet painting too. One of the dungeons has a giant Buddha-like figure rising out of the water, and another lets you manipulate the map in order to reach previously unaccessible rooms. I really appreciated the subtle genius of that one.The new items are fun to explore, especially the flying beetle. Once you get the bow and arrow, it's a breeze to pull back the string and let the arrow fly right between an enemy's eyes. The whip is a little under-utilized. And after being able to swing around like Spiderman in Twilight Princess using the dual clawshots, these seemed a little static.Using the sword isn't 100% accurate, but it's servicable, thanks to the Wii Motion Plus. Unfortunately, combat is tedious too. I think there are only six types of enemies in the game-bats, plants, slimes, fish in and out of water, and Bokoblins. There are different variations of these enemies, but you've seen them all about a third of the way through. There's a boss you fight three times, with only minor variations, and another you dual three times, but he's a little more varied each time. I'm talking about Ghirahim, who is an interesting, if under-utilized villain. On a sidenote, can't wait to see some Ghirahim cosplay. Anyway, the small villain roster makes the game seem small.Speaking of small, the world at first looks huge. But Skyloft is barren. There's nothing to do except fly in a straight line. Traveling, which should be exhilerating, is a boring chore. The ground worlds are expansive, but you have to visit each one three times. It just reminds you how small the world is. I did enjoy visiting Faron Woods when it was flooded, though. That was a really  neat alteration of a familiar territory.Anyway, despite all my complaining, I did enjoy the game. It just feels like that the game has been in development for six years, but still came out undercooked. I also wish the frustrations were fewer. I actually avoided picking up items and treasures just to avoid the repetitive dialog boxes. That is not a good thing. Can't we have a mode for people who aren't total video game novices?

5171,102495,A3ALLLC2FXZ134,B00149PCAO,Halicon5,"[1, 1]","I was very excited about Mirror's Edge when I read about it.  It looked like a new, beautiful, and innovative game.  It looked really fun.  I was correct about new, beautiful, and innovative, but the fun seems to be missing.Mirror's Edge is an intense first-person run-and-jump platforming game similar to Tomb Raider and Prince of Persia but with a focus on speed.  The game's premise is that the player must quickly determine the most effective route from point A to point B across the rooftops pulling some insanely cool Hollywood style stunts along the way.  Graphically, the game is beautiful and I especially like the color palette.  In fact, the color palette is actually very important to gameplay as it represents your ""runner's sense"" and subtly shows you the correct route.  The idea behind the game is great.  The story, what I've seen at least, seems pretty good.  The problem is the gameplay falls apart and frequently results in repeated frustrating falls to your death in a trial and error fashion.My personal theory is that this game isn't finished yet, having been rushed out the door to be ready for Christmas.  The controls just don't feel tweaked and finished yet.  If the platforming and running controls had been completed before shipping the game, I think I'd have loved the game.  Examples of bad control:- Doing simple things, like jumping up onto a waist-high box or ledge, frequently requires multiple tries because you often jump too far or end up banging your shins on it and falling back down.  All the while, helicopters and cops are shooting at you and laughing because you can't climb onto a simple box as you run for your life.- Grabbing stuff sometimes just doesn't happen.  I don't know why, but sometimes I could grab a ledge or pipe and other times I couldn't even though it felt like I was doing the exact same thing.- The indoor environments are not as fun as they could be because they limit your ability to do what the character does best, which is RUN.  A lot of your maneuvers require that you build up a certain amount of momentum with a good long run, but being inside really kills your ability to build up speed properly which results in more trial and error situations than is really acceptable.- Combat is broken in my opinion.  When it works, combat makes you feel like you pulled off some sweet Jet Li action.  Unfortunately, reliably pulling those moves off takes far more practice than it should.  Don't worry though, because you'll get a lot of practice from all dying you'll do.  I could cope with a broken combat system though because combat is maybe 10%-15% of the game.Sadly, Mirror's Edge just isn't as good as the hype set it out to be.  The game controls feel rushed and unfinished, and I blame the industry tendency to push things out just in time for Christmas for that.  When things work, this game shines and feels awesome, but that feeling is often killed by frequent trial-and-error moments in the game.  What I really hope is that a sequel is released that addresses the issues I described above.",2,Hopefully a sequel will address this game's flaws...,1230422400,"12 28, 2008"

Not as much from the bland story as the fact that there is an UNSOLVABLE puzzle (aka Miss Valley's seminar work), product of buggy programming. Is this even LEGAL in a game that basically gets stuck forever if a puzzle can't be solved? Did any QA go into this release? Imagine spending hours trying to work it out, only to realize (once you've become frustrated enough to go looking for a walkthrough), that you HAD solved it -- repeatedly, in fact.A buggy puzzle that won't acknowledge it's been solved... bet you can see your face pictured in one those ""priceless"" credit card ads.

Your suspension of disbelief long gone, all you hope for is a workaround and to end the stupid game quickly (you no longer trust the designers to deliver on the promise of a water-tight mystery). The walkthrough simply suggests you simply use the puzzle-skipping button, which only comes up after a sufficiently big number of repeated attempts. That the game needs such a feature says volumes about it.So there you have it.

Having never played the original, I was a little in the dark about the story, but the history is fairly intersting even though the main plot is kind of thin. The gameplay is fluid and you definately get a good assortment of moves to dispatch your enemies with. The level progression system is definatively Diablo inspired. Now for what's wrong with the game. For starters, your max level is 9. Which for any adventure/rpg title is very disappointing on more than one count. Case in point, you cannot max out all of your stats at level 9, which means you must allocate points to only the skills you want to really beef up. Which wouldn't be terrible if A) You were actually aware that you had to do this, and B) If the game didn't force you to use all of your potential skills. So what you end up having instead of a customizable character whom you can choose to make a fighter or a spellcaster, etc. you are forced to have a little of everything, creating an overall mediocre character. My second complaint, although not as bad as the first, is that the difficulty of the game only increases in the number of monsters you must kill later on. So instead of throwing some engrossing puzzles at you, you end up just hacking your way through the last few levels of the game. If they ever make another sequel, I hope they improve on these flaws, because the game does have a solid foundation, but in the end, I was disappointed.",2,When Good Games go bad,1058400000,"07 17, 2003"

11738,178232,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,B004VQENY8,Steffan Piper,"[48, 51]","Clearly, this game is the Dungeons & Dragons of this generation, with game play centering on buying little figurines, just like D&D; and also buying upgrade missions (obviously many more to come in the months ahead), just like D&D.; A lot of people reading this may not understand this point, but those old enough that played Dungeons & Dragons know full well the truth of it. This was a brilliant and long-awaited brain storm by Activision.First, this is a game for kids to play as young as 4 and as old as 80. Yet another strong marketing move by Activision to create such an incredibly imaginative game for the 4-15 age range. Also this game isn't ridiculously hard at any time and it never gets violent or bloody.Characters:Part of the fun, and downfall, is collecting the little characters which there are currently 32 of. Lots of retailers, including Amazon sell them, but as of right now -- everyone is sold out - everywhere.Everyone is clamoring for these things and people are sadly taking advantage of that and reselling them for almost a hundred bucks on Ebay. It makes no sense that they have lots of the same characters that are available in the combination packages, which are the only ones left. I think you can still buy Trigger Happy and Boomer just about everywhere.Finding Air Characters - as well as the Legendary Versions? Good luck, we've searched all over Southern California and have come up empty. Activision should've really bulked up before the season. Perhaps they were wondering if this game was going to be a success or fall flat. I think they have an answer.Glitches & Bugs:The biggest problem with the game itself, and the reason why I only give the game three stars, is primarily for the reason that there are LOTS and LOTS of glitches and bugs in this game. It's almost as if someone at Activision said:""Hey, Christmas is coming quick and the testing isn't quite finished and all the bugs aren't worked out yet, but let's go ahead and go to market with it so we don't miss the big retail season.""That scenario seems completely plausible after you play this game for only a few levels. The biggest glitch is the problem that occurs at Level 20, where the 'Weapons Master' is asleep, and shouldn't be and cannot be re-awoken to complete the final stage of the game and beat Kaos.Just a quick Google of the term 'Weapons Master Asleep' brings up everything and no fixes. Sadly, there is no fix. You can play this game for days only to get to the end and not be able to finish it, which is a big stickler for serious gamers. Nothing like dangling a carrot.I emailed Activision and they gave their canned response that they've given everyone and the suggestions just don't work at all and you're forced to restart a new game on 'File 2' and start all over. Sad but true.I've also encountered a lot of bugs and areas where you just can't get out of in the Dark Light Crypt Mission.Positive thoughts:I honestly love this game and I play this with my four year old son every weekend and it's all he talks about. You build up each character, making them stronger and collecting stuff which you can then take to a friends house and play and they have the same strengths, which are completely portable.None of the figures are really scary, none are sexualized and all of them say silly little things that makes kids laugh.Extras & Missions:There are currently two upgrade mission packs for sale, each one comes with a character and a magical item or two. We *always* play with the Hidden Treasure item on the platform in order to find the hidden chest on every level.A healing Vase comes with the other upgrade pack which is also good for restoring your character during battles.The hourglass slows down enemies so you can wipe them out if you're outnumbered.",3,Fantastic Game ...

With updated graphics, remixed music, better sounds, newer areas, and a map (yes, for the young kids, the original Metroid had no map!), it's a Classic Metroid fanboy's fantasy.  You even play as suitless Samus in a stealth mission, armed only with an automatic-charging pistol (this part is definitely one of the toughest parts in the game, since the pistol only stuns and the Space Pirates take off 100 HP when they touch you or shoot you).  The game even tells you where to go by using Chozo statues, making it much less frustration.  However, this is also a problem.  The game is easily beaten in 1-2 hours in one sitting due to the fact that you know where to go with the Chozo statues and the new weapons.  When you get to Tourian, the Metroids are easily destroyed, as opposed to how you drop off the elevator in the original and next thing you know 2 or 3 Metroids are sucking you bone dry, and you watch as your health just goes from full to 0 in 10 seconds.  Also the bosses are sissies (especially Ridley, who screeches like a little girl while you stand under him and bombard him with missiles.  Yes this is a strategy on how to easily beat Ridley), but I can't say the same for Mother Brain (who is actually far tougher than in the original), who actually uses energy waves to damage you alot this time.  But still, this is an excellent, fun to play remake of such a classic game.

Even if it proved to be disappointing, it wasn't like I was dropping fifty bucks on it. Well, it would have been worth fifty (or more).This is one of the best titles I've ever played for the Xbox (or any other system). It has great action, incredible gameplay, and some truly innovative ideas. The story is pretty simple: You're Glitch, a re-assembled mining robot who's out to save his fellow robots from the nefarious schemes of General Corrosive and his legions of evil Mil bots. This game is basically a combination of a third-person shooter (with a trouble-free camera setup, a definite plus) and a platformer. It's mission-based: Go from point A to point B, kill anything that gets in your way, go to the next level. That's par for the course with most platformers. What makes this game stand out, however, is intense action and the unique elements incorporated into its gameplay. You can hijack enemy robots either through terminals scattered about the game (looking much like arcade consoles) or using a control tether (awarded about halfway through the game). Sometimes this is required in order to advance; there are some security checkpoints that only enemy bots can pass. Other times, you're allowed to just wreak havoc; at one point, you control a giant Titan robot, a &quot;weapon of mass destruction&quot; if there ever was one. If you're careful, you can sneak up on an enemy, hijack him, and have him take out a number of enemies before he's destroyed (or goes out of range). Another way to take control of an enemy is to use a Recruitment Grenade. Use that, and he'll fight for you until he's dead or you release him.--A tip: When you're finished using an enemy bot, have him destroy himself (jump into water or a chasm, for example). Otherwise, that's another enemy you'll have to deal with.You begin with some basic weapons, gaining more powerful ones as the game progresses. Additionally, most of the weapons can be upgraded, either with upgrades found at random points in the game, or by buying them from two shopkeeping robots (with loads of attitude, natch) that you encounter here and there. You buy upgrades using washers that dead enemies sometimes leave behind.--A couple of hints: An easy way to get extra washers is to shoot enemy computer terminals and machines. Also, don't be too quick to buy upgrades, and don't upgrade every weapon. Some are worth it, and some aren't. The game will give you some upgrades (for example, you get one at the beginning of &quot;Enter the Trenches,&quot; and another is hidden behind a large rock in a trench). Definitely upgrade the rocket launcher (your best defense against Titans), the SPEW (a machine-gun, basically), the Rivet Gun (fire explosive rivets, and has good range) and the Scatter Blaster (devastating at close range). Don't bother to spend the extra rivets on the Mining Laser (weak, even at maximum power) or the Ripper (ditto).You also have a steady supply of Coring Charges (the game's equivalent of grenades) and special thrown weapons. There's the EMP grenade, which casts an electromagnetic pulse that disables enemies for a few moments, long enough for you to destroy or hijack them. Be careful: Though you have some shielding from the EMP effect, it can disorient you if you get too close. Magma grenades cast a lethally intense pool of liquid fire, very effective against Titans or closely-clustered enemies.Scattered throughout the game are gold chips. Collect enough of them, and you'll unlock multiplayer levels. Also, you can gain speed chips by finishing a level in a certain amount of time.Graphically, this title really shines on the XBox. The game features great particle effects; when you destroy an enemy, he tends to explode in stages (usually from the top down), shedding wires, gears, and shrapnel in every direction. The larger the enemy, the more impressive his demise. Lighting and environmental effects are realistically rendered, and Glitch himself is well-designed and moves easily and smoothly. Controls are simple and uncomplicated. Double-handed attacks (for example, with the SPEW and a coring charge) are very effective against large groups of enemies. A single rocket shot combined with a Coring Charge directed at a Titan can be devastating.What else can I say? First-rate all the way, full of action, humor, and excellent gameplay. Definitely recommended to fans of action games and shooters.--Christian Wheeler",4,Heavy metal thunder,1089849600,"07 15, 2004"

It's a really short game, and even with the great online play all COD's offer there just isn't enough to warrant the price tag. And the online gameplay serves to aggravate as well. Spawn points that repeatedly drop you into the line of direct fire, giving the player no hope at ever getting a break.I know, it all seems like excuses given by inexperienced gamers who cry about getting their a$$ kicked, but honestly, this is happening purely because the developers sucked.

That's  practically every game Sony made!!!), but finally agreed.  I can now see  why.  Not only were the games NOTHING Sony promised us (They said the games  were going to be a revolution.  I fail to see how.).  For one thing the  graphics are nothing that the Dreamcast hasn't offered us.  For onther  things were still getting the sames games over, and over!  Just with better  graphics!  No internet play (SEGA already has an advantage with that in  mind!), and didn't Sony promise us it would be compatable with Playstation  games?  I thought so too.  But only 3 of the 27 games we tried to do this  with worked!  And it didn't enhance the graphics!!!  The DVD player is  nothing but trash also.  It won't play many movies, and those it does play  don't have very good quality!  Plus DVD players are on cell phones  practically, why would we want them on a game counsel (Especally if you've  already got a DVD player)!?!  Plus almost all games (Playstation or  Playstation 2 games) freeze up countless times!  In Tekken because I was  fighting too fast the system froze up on me, but yet in Sonic Adventure (On  Dreamcast) I'm running on walls, jumping off buldings, and zooming around  the place at 70 miles per hour and the game doesn't glich once!!!  Now  thats sad (For Sony anyway).  And when it comes down to the worst games  I've played yet, don't expect this system to last long.  With that in mind  please be careful when buying this system, it might be worse thanyou  thought it would be.",1,"Sony May Make Promises, But Will They Keep Them?",968630400,"09 11, 2000"

That being said, This is fairly close with a few slight imperfections. I'll just do some quick pros & cons.Pros:-Amazingly in depth ground game. If you know wrestling and bjj, you basically have the right stick as hip control.-Awesome Graphics. They did an amazing job designing the real life fighters. Sure chuck grew some muscle in game, and there's no Randy, but they did a pretty good job!-Create a Fighter is the most fun I've had in a fighting game in a long time. Seriously.-It's fun to win, or even sometimes if it's a great match, to lose online. As long as they don't ragequit.-You get to play the greatest sport in the world, now with less bruises and weight cutting.-Change History while you're at it. Maybe Franklin should have won. Maybe Hughes was too powerful for BJ. Maybe The Natural wasn't too old for Brock...wait, you don't get Randy, legal dispute... anyways it's fun to remake classic fights how you want to.Cons:-No southpaw. Really. This changes a lot of striking situations. Wish it was there.-Actually everyone uses the same stance. I'm sure it'd be insanely hard for all the permutations created by that, but some different stances would be nice.-Never found a way to check the leg. Checking or dodging a leg kick is basic training in Muay Thai.-No head movement. Ducking a hook to follow with a counter is effective, but impossible with this build.-The counter-grapple is insanely over powered. All it is ""flick right stick"" with timing. Once you get dominant position, waiting for a counter opportunity, repeating indefinitely then finish or submit. Kinda feels like ""first to get position wins through attrition"" when both players get really good at this. Probably accurate, but makes the game pretty boring.Overall, it's a fighters must buy. You have to play it to appreciate that through all it's little quirks, it's a hell of a game. And to beat your friends 114PT Glitch-god with your 75PT CAF with stacked strength, speed, and endurance.

10905,229938,AZGQXYB4TAODL,B00GANWVJE,FightForTheLost,"[19, 233]","Yet another day and another abysmal Aonuma Zelda is defecated out upon our collective heads.Where to begin?Gameplay:1. Overly easy: challenge free gameplay that makes Celda Wand Wacker Teletubby Island (some erroniously refer to this game as ""Zelda Wind Waker"") gameplay come off like Ninja Gaiden in comparison. Seriously you will NEVER die in this game, not even ONCE, not even if you are a lobotomy patient!2. Items: No need to possess any actual skill, just go around and hack up some bushes (Eiji Aonuma's favorite gameplay element from LTTP incidentally) and collect enough rupees and you can buy everything that you used to have to search for (in the superior Pre-Aonuma Zelda's ie Zelda 1-4) in order to find. Just pay that stupid Ravio creature for it and you'll get everything from the hookshot to the boomerang with no risk at all to your character's health.3. Lame gimmick: which turns you into a wall painting, the true purpose of which is not to expand the gameplay elements of the Zelda series in any meaningful way but just another arrogant and obnoxious attempt by Eiji Aonuma to force his disgusting and deformed art style version of Link down our collective throats. The guy simply will not learn his lesson that the Zelda fanbase utterly rejects his chibi art style as well the Saturday morning cartoon presentation for Zelda. In the year 2013 we demand realism NOT sub par dumbed down graphics that appeal to the soccer mom and kintergarten set. We especially desire beautiful epic graphics and sophisticated art styles because we are paying for these expensive overpriced game machines to play these type of games on and we want to see some actual visual performance for our money. In anycase Aonuma doesn't just need to be fired by Nintendo, Nintendo should of never hired him to begin with.4. Recharge bar: for all the Nintendo fanboy whining about the dominance of the ""dudebro"" first person shooter (FPS) games dominating the world of videogames these days and arguably dumbing it down as a result Eiji Aonuma has ripped off this feature from the Halo series but instead of providing a shield for Link Aonuma has used HIS recharge bar newly added gameplay element to make the game even easier than it already was since now you no longer have to find magic vials or arrows while adventuring out in the world the bar just recharges automatically after you shoot some arrows or use an item such as say the lantern. Seriously Aonuma will not be satisfied until Nintendo allows him to add a dedicated ""win button"" to Zelda.-Continued pushing of Nintendo's politically correct LGBT agenda by featuring a decidedly homosexual character in a Bunny rabbit suit named Ravio. Ravio is a human character dressed in a bunny suit that helps your character Link throughout the game by offering him various ""tools"" (note the subconscious innuendo there)...Anyway I believe the proper term for this sort of sexual fetish means of dress up role play is called being a ""furry"" if I'm not mistaken? Whatever the case its incredibly sick and inappropriate for children to be exposed to a freak like Ravio in this sort of ""E for everyone"" style game. I'm quite certain Nintendo's featuring of this sick and unsavory degenerate character of Ravio is along the same lines as how the tobacco companies used to use the Joe camel character to push young children into smoking. Well Nintendo obviously wants to encourage young people to become homosexuals which doesn't make any sense since the left generally says such people are born and not made. In anycase creepy and inappropriate character design by Nintendo/Aonuma here and thats not a judgement of being anti gay or even anti furry it is simply a desire for cohesiveness and congruency ie a movie about Martin Luther King Jr. would not be at all served in it's contexual believability by having a white man play the part of Dr. King, likewise homosexual characters and furry fetishists simply do not belong in the context of a midieval sword and sorcery action adventure which The Legend Of Zelda always was, up until the moment that is the untalented hack Eiji Aonuma got involved in it's development. Now much like with society Aonuma has destructively turned Zelda into an ""anything goes"" free for all where trains, robots, homosexuals, furries and other inappropriate set pieces are placed in a game world where they simply do not belong.-Rehashing Zelda: A Link To the Past's overworld maps in order to try and trick the Zelda fanbase into believing that Zelda is returning to it's glorious form from the past, when really this game is just another Aonuma turd that would've been better off not being made at all.What Zelda as a series and game franchise desperately needs is Yoshiaki Kozuimi or Takashi Tezuka in the director's chair for it ever as a series to return to health.To conclude and re-state my own review title over again because its THAT important to say it twice...Eiji Aonuma is a cancer on the Zelda series and must be excised for the Zelda series to ever become well again.I rated this game a 1 star because to my knowledge it simply could not be rated lower in Amazon's system.",1,Eiji Aonuma is a cancer on the Zelda series,1386547200,"12 9, 2013"

Anyone familiar with the Castlevania series at all knows this to be fact, as Konami's attempts to bring the long running series to the realm of 3-D have just fallen flat.  Now we get a Castlevania fighting game (don't ask why) with Castlevania Judgment for the Wii, which even though it says it's a Castlevania game, is really a generic fighting game with little personality to it to seperate it from the rest of the pack.  There's a decent roster of fighters that Castlevania fans will recognize, such as Simon Belmont, Alucard, and even Dracula; but there isn't much variation or real differences between most of the fighters.  The fighting system appears to offer some depth, but it really isn't anything you haven't seen countless times before.  The game doesn't look too bad though, and there is some great music as well, but there just isn't enough here that helps the game stand out on its own.

Certainly the worst I've ever played. I'm not just talking about the critics here. I'm talking about how the gamers felt. Hello Kitty Island Adventure scored even higher than this game. Yes, the critics such as IGN gave the game a 1.5/10... the worse this generation. But as a gamer, I give it a 0.5 out of 10. Why? The 0.5 goes toward the end credits sequence. It's actually so terrible, it's good. But truth be told, Rebellion just doesn't care. Rogue Warrior took 2 hours to beat, and cost $59.99. Retail value for a game that's broke. The AI was so bad, I can't even describe it. And it had such a strange weapons system... you could shoot a guy from 4 feet away, but the computer automatically randomized your hit/miss ratio, so you may get a headshot or may not. It's not about accuracy, it randomly generates a hit/miss ratio. I hit a guy from 50 meters away, but missed him with the gun pointed straight at his head. I'm telling you, after that experience I do not trust Rebellion.For the sake of not getting robbed, do not purchase this game.

I've been playing fighting games for about 20 years (I was 11 when SF2CE came out for Genesis) and after using gamepads almost exclusively for most of those years (except when in an arcade if you remember those), I have to say that this stick is simply awesome. I play tons of different fighting games on emulators on PC and this game has literally extended the play value of several games because it has allowed me to execute techniques that were never possible on a gamepad (I prefer the Playstation's gamepad fyi.) I'm primarily a Zangief/Hawk player and being able to execute some clever tick grabs like never before is quite satisfying indeed.The build quality of the stick is quite excellent. I feel like the stick has actually gotten better with the wear I've put on it. Having a square gate, with some wear it is now a smoother experience doing 360 moves (really only 270 degrees in SF2, 225 in SF4). The only moves I have difficulty with using the square gate would be double fireball motions for super moves. You can certainly do them, I just have some difficulty with consistency with the square feel. DP motions are excellent and charge characters awesome as well.My kids have also dropped it a few times (much to my dismay), even face down on the stick from about 3 feet off the counter. This thing doesn't even care. It still looks and works like new. The buttons don't have quite the arcade feel and snap, but they are certainly very responsive and they more than do their job.TLDR: This stick is an awesome quality and by far the best performance-to-price ratio fight stick I could find.

1449,164939,A1IQV6AI7L9NOK,B003ZS1JFE,Feelah the tigress,"[1, 1]","I've already played another CSI game (CSI: Dark Motives), but wasn't too impressed by it.  The core concept was good, but the gameplay execution was a bit flawed (too many times where taps were unresponsive and needed actions were too obscure) and the story was a bit lackluster.  I was still interested in trying out another CSI game though because I noticed in hindsight that Dark Motives had the lowest reviewer scores out of all of them, but the other games had decent scores.  So, I picked up CSI: Unsolved to give the series another shot.  I've never actually seen the CSI TV show, but I've always liked crime investigation-type point-and-click adventure games, and the CSI series seems right up my alley.  Time to give this series another chance to impress me!Graphics (score 8/10): The graphics are animated (""cartoon""-style, if you like) 2-D images which are pretty commonplace in the point-and-click adventure game genre (but kind of odd since CSI: Dark Motives had more realistic 3-D rendered character models).  The cutscenes consist of still images moving across static backgrounds which can barely be described as animated.  I do really like the level of detail in the environments, though.  Everything is colorful and crisp-looking, and you can see all the details that you need to be able to see (like to find items/evidence).  I've seen more expressive character portraits, but overall, these graphics aren't bad at all.  I'm sure you're all wondering one last thing: do the character models look like the people from the TV show?  Well, I have no idea.  I've never actually seen the show, so I don't know how well they resemble their real-life counterparts.Music (score 8/10): No voices, but there is music.  Strangely CSI: Dark Motives had a real lack of music, but that is not a problem here.  There is music in every area, and it's pretty good music.  It's actually a bit more interesting than some other music I've heard in this genre, so I'm pretty pleased with it.Characters (score 7/10): You play once again as a ""rookie"" CSI who serves as an avatar for the player and therefore has no face nor personality.  You even have to input your own name for the character.  I'll just let my bias be know here - I really dislike ""silent protagonists"" or basically what amounts to a cardboard cutout character who lacks any form of distinct personality at all.  I forgive this game a bit for doing this though because I understand what they were going for - they wanted the player to be able to interact directly with the cast of the show rather than playing as one of those characters.  That's fine and all, so what about the other characters?  Well, I can't really say whether or not the in-game characters' personalities are correct for what the show portrays.  I can tell you if they stand on their own as decent characters in just this game.  Well...  They're just okay.  The characters do have a bit of personality to them, but nothing too distinctive or memorable.Story (score 7/10): They really throw the player right into the game - you start up your first case immediately as a ""rookie"" CSI.  Right there, you're thrust onto a crime scene.  Each individual case has a basic storyline to it, but this is by no means a story-heavy game.  The plots of each case are just interesting enough to make you want to figure out who the killer is, but that's about it.  Don't expect any Phoenix Wright levels of epic storytelling here.  That being the case, each case is stand-alone in it's story and they do not build to a climax of any kind.  Overall, for this genre, I'd call the story ""average""; nothing special here.  As for the length, there are five cases, and each case is pretty short, and even though I spread out my playtime over several days, you could probably finish this game in 10-15 hours if you wanted to.Gameplay (score 10/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  The basic interface is really good and has no problems at all.  It's very easy to figure out what items you can and cannot interact with since your cursor turns yellow whenever you touch such an item.  If the item needs to have a tool used on it, a number of tool options pop up for you to choose from.  It's interesting that they don't give you ALL the tool choices at once; it's rather nice since this means that there's less floundering around trying to figure out exactly which tool to use.  The bad news is that the tools are just represented by simplistic outlines, and sometimes I'm not 100% sure what something is.  It'd be nice to have an option for a brief description of each tool and what it does.  Anyway, once you are done with an item, your cursor won't turn yellow over it anymore, which makes it easy to know if you've already taken care of something.  Very nice.  As for other aspects of gameplay...  There are branching dialogue options, which I enjoy, but I highly doubt they actually effect anything story-wise.  There is one time that the dialogue options matter, and that's during suspect interrogations.  You will come to certain statements with suspects where you have the option to present evidence to contradict their statement or you can let it pass uncontested.  If you have ever played a Phoenix Wright game, this'll feel really familiar (and fun).  Other than that, I should talk about the lab.  Other than investigating clues and evidence at the crime scene and interrogating suspects, you spend a lot of gameplay in the crime lab.  The tests you do are much less realistic than the ones in CSI: Dark Motives.  For example, the DNA sequencing looks like a realistic DNA sequence graph in Dark Motives, but here in CSI: Unsolved you match up simple shapes like squares and circles.  The same is true for all the other tests, none of which are realistic at all.  I must say though, this game is quite enjoyable since there are no real gameplay issues such as unregistered taps or obscure order to finding evidence (both issues in CSI: Dark Motives).  There is one tiny issue with this game I'd like to bring up: it's tricky at first to figure out how to save.  You actually have to go to the menu and then choose ""quit game"".  It doesn't say at any point that it's saving your file, and it freaked me out to try it at first.  Of course, once you know that's how you save, it's no longer an issue.  Anyway, at the end of each case, you'll receive a score which is based on how many mistakes you made before you got something right, which I guess could add some replay value if you played through again to get higher scores.  That's pretty much it.Overall (score 7/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Well, this is a pretty darn good game for anyone who's looking for a point-and-click style game that's themed around crime investigation.  It's just unfortunate that the story elements aren't stronger; if there had been a stronger story to go along with the fun gameplay, this game would've gotten a much higher score.  As it is, this game is certainly worth picking up if you're a fan of either the CSI TV show, or the point-and-click genre in general.",4,"A Pretty Good Game, Even For Someone Who's Never Seen The Show!",1329782400,"02 21, 2012"

Anyone who played FIFA '08 will be right at home with the interface and graphics of the game but discover changes upon diving deeper into the game.The graphics remain largely unchanged from FIFA '08. To it's discredit EA hasn't improved visuals in the stadiums and has neglected several larger venues altogether, instead opting for generic backgrounds. I was sorely disappointed to find when playing a huge rivalry match of Barcelona vs. Real Madrid at Camp Nou, the stadium was awash in generic colors. There was the odd red jersey here or there but nothing striking. Disappointing considering this was an issue raised by the fans in the last several FIFA games.There are positive notes in the graphics department, however. First the ""shiny"" look of players from FIFA '08 is gone. Player animations have improved and are smoother. Also included for the first time is the ability to control player celebrations with some simple button presses after scoring a goal. Cartwheels, running slides, and more subtle celebrations help immerse the player into the game.On the gameplay front things are much better. Ball physics are greatly improved over '08 and the ball doesn't feel as magnetic as it once did. To EA's credit the controls are completely customizable so everyone can tune the buttons to their individual preference. I did notice some that on the higher difficulty levels the game can still cheaply score or miraculously tackle the ball every time.As usual the soundtrack to FIFA offers a unique, wide ranging sampling of music from different corners of the planet. It's always enjoyable discovering new artists first in FIFA and adding their tracks to my iPod. The crowd sound effects remain largely unchanged from '08 which isn't a bad thing. Commentary maintains its high standard as well.Best of all in '09 is the ability to really manage your team in detail. On the field tactics adjustments are back and don't require a pause in the action. Off the field, fine tuning adjustments can be made to everyone from the build-up to player aggression on offense and defense. It's really a whole new level of player control to FIFA. Another great feature is that fine tuning adjustments can be saved and applied to specific teams. So if you're playing an offensive powerhouse you can load up your more defensive minded tactics and presto, you're set to play!All in all I am very pleased with FIFA '09. As I stated it's not a revolutionary change from FIFA's past but an incremental improvement.

I've thought that computer games could be excellent medium for storytelling for a long time, and The Longest Journey is storytelling on a grand scale. The tale it tells is intricate, deep, and very cleverly put together. I'm a big fan of story, and it's the story that keeps you playing this game, pure and simple.The voice acting in The Longest Journey is some of the best I've ever seen for any computer game, anywhere, especially when you consider the sheer volume of voice work that had to go into it. Sarah Hamilton, the voice of main character April Ryan, should have won some kind of award. She carried this game with a charming personality that is so rare... it really sets the standard for future games of this sort. The other voices were equally good, especially when you note in the credits that many of the actors voiced multiple characters, and did it without being obvious about it.The graphics are a little outdated compared to many more recent games, but the good part of that is that The Longest Journey will run on PC's that are a little older. The gameplay is clever and intuitive, and never gets in the way of actually playing the game (a feat many games never seem to manage). The puzzles (which are many) are a little contrived at some points, but for the most part they work. The game definitely makes you think your way around some corners, but the solutions are there.What it comes down to, though, is the story. It starts out a little slow, while they establish the characters, but it's all worth it because by the end, I actually cared about what was happening to them. Revelations near the end of the story are both moving and actually surprising, and the gameplay is balanced well with the progress of the story.The Longest Journey would make a great novel, or a great film, but honestly I believe that one of its strengths was that it was told through the medium of the game. While the story is strong enough to be maintained in a more mainstream medium, the interactive nature of it is one of the things that make it so magical.The ending is as satisfying as one could hope for, but it leaves an opening for a sequel... and indeed, Dreamfall is coming in 2005, a continuation of the The Longest Journey. I'll be looking forward to that one.Great game, great story, well worth the money and time spent on it, and proof that the medium of computer games is ripe for some fantastic storytelling.

After this scene the game focuses on Alex, Alex is a 15 year boy who idolizes Dyne and one day dreams of becoming a Dragonmaster himself, due to Dynes death 15 years prior. Alex is soon able to start this quest to become a Dragonmaster when his best friend Ramus tells him the white dragon cave can now be explored due to some ice surrounding the cave melting, although the adventure initially starts out with them looking for a very rare dragon diamond. Before Alex and Ramus go on their adventure, Alex has to find a way to tell Luna, a girl who has been living with Alex since she was a baby that he wants to go on this adventure, eventually Luna agrees to let Alex go on the condition that she is able to come along, due to her being worried sick if she lets Ramus and Alex go alone. This ultimately sets in motion a tale of, love, friendship, and betrayal.That's really just the tip of the story in Lunar, the story told here is an enjoyable one and I found myself liking each and every character introduced, the story never does stray and it does not blur the initial purpose of the game, it just keeps getting more and more interesting the further you get in Lunar. The graphics in Lunar have been completely redone, if you look at some screen shots/videos from the first Lunar, to the Saturn and the Playstation remake, you will see that everything has been updated, this was not just a quick port, and it shows here, towns/sprites are all hand drawn and very detailed. From my understanding the combat has not changed at all in this version of Lunar, and that's a good thing. Lunar mixes up the traditional turn based combat by actually making you make sure your character has enough distance to attack a foe and vice versa, if you are on the other side of the screen from an enemy your 3 hit attack my dwindle down to a 1 hitter, although this does not apply to most special attacks/magic. Music in Lunar is really good, I found myself humming most tunes and I still have a few of the voiced songs stuck in my head XD. Loading time on my PSP-1000 is really good, there is a 2 second loading interval when your going into just about anything (except the menu) but I was un-bothered by it. When your going into different towns or a long cut-scene is coming up you will get hit with a loading screen but it is not overly long (its about 10-15 seconds.)Lunar does have quite a few anime cut-scenes (done in a really nice style I might add), and most of them are well over a minute long (there are around 20 or so if I recall correctly, although you do have to do certain things to get the ones that are unrelated to the main story).  One thing I found strange with Lunar would be that when you first start playing you are treated to a healthy number of cut-scenes near the beginning, within the first 4 hours of gameplay I had at least seen 7 anime cut scenes most of them being generous in length, then Lunar tripped up and you only got a few bones thrown to you once in a while in terms of some anime. Near the end of the game however Lunar rewards you with at least 5 cut scenes all being well over 3 minutes long, I think in total there is around 30 minutes of anime to be seen here, I'm not complaining, I just wish there would have been more cut scenes in the middle portion of the game. It should be noted however that the cut-scenes are all in their original 4:3 presentation, they do not take advantage of the PSP's wide screen, however I do believe that this was done so that all the cut scenes could be added in, due to the video files taking up less space (and you can also compress the videos more without noticing). The voice acting in Lunar is spot on with the exception of Nall who is spotty at best, although I have read/heard that Nall's voice has always been spotty and that this Nall is an improvement!The thing I really enjoyed about Lunar was that it was not too hard, but it did kind of border on easy, I read that the difficulty was actually lowered from the PS remake, and that the characters got somewhat overpowered with the addition of special abilities (especially Mia's ice wall she casts on the party which make them invincible for 3 turns, even on the final boss!) If I wanted a hard, level grinding RPG I would play my home consoles, but for the PSP the difficulty was perfect for me.

I was unhappy with the 8s it was getting in the press, especially from those reviewers that didn't seem to understand ""why ya gotta knock out all the lights all the time"" in The Darkness. Gee I don't know...I wonder why in a game called The Darkness that you have to be in the darkness to do stuff. Huh. Go figure...Good- voice acting (professional actors, plus Mike Patton)- good story- animation (especially the darkness tentacles). Tearing peoples hearts out is simply cool.- competent shooter- the hands in the FPS aspect of the game move differently that other FPS...it has it's own FPS style.- no HUD means enjoy the beauty- Strarbreeze is a good engine; it's good to have something else out there besides Unreal Engine.- unexpected Hell levels. Very very cool.- interactive TVs you can watch in the game (it's a little known fact that the blu-ray has 10gb more of non-exclusive content here than the xbox DVD9 - which offends me as an xbox owner).Mediocre- Friendly AI doesn't necessarily always shoot straightBad- As with Starbreeze's last excellent title (Butcher Bay), it has a VERY BAD BUG THAT NEEDS TO BE PATCHED. At the time I played it, I got half-way through the game, and HAD TO RESTART FROM THE BEGINNING because of a glitch. This happened to all kinds of people in the xbox forum. It is inexcusable for a title that has so few side missions which are small and uncomplicated for this to happen! Bad game testing!!! This is my only criticism of the game. Similar thing happened in Butcher Bay - it let's you get significantly far into the game without forcing you to obtain a weapon that you WILL NEED in further levels forcing you to restart. BAD BAD BAD! I must say that NONE OF THE PROFESSIONAL REVIEWERS MENTION THIS BUG!!! They criticize it for really stupid things, like the fact that you have to knock out the lights!

So I picked it up at the rental store, and thank God I did only rent this game and waste $5 as opposed to $60.From the moment you turn the game on, the graphics and story line pull you right in. You watch a few movie segments go by, which are awesome, and then you are cast into game play. This is when the game takes a sharp turn down hill.From the moment you start playing you are hopelessly delivered an ambiance trying to recreate something between the lines of games' Max Payne, Dead to Rights, and The Punisher. Instead, you end up flying around with guns blazing on what seems like unlimited ammo at your dumb enemies mindlessly killing everything in sight. I might add that there are ridiculous amounts of enemies that come at you from all over the place, and yet it takes about a hundred gun shots or so to bring you down. This is on the normal difficulty I might add. Then while you're trying to like this game, you can't help but realize the graphics on this game could have been accomplished on a last-gen console, and it probably could have been even better than that.I'd also like to mention that your enemies' AI are probably dumber than a toaster oven. They don't take cover. They don't try and flank you or out wit you. They just all simply take bad shots at you as they stand in the middle of their little area waiting to be shot.The game controls are a bit clumsy as well, making this game even harder to try and enjoy. It's easy to shoot, don't get me wrong, but with so many enemies coming around you from all different angles out of nowhere, it's difficult to try and get a grasp on who and what you're shooting at. There is a cover system, but no where near is there the kind of fluidity that takes place in gaining cover compared to Gears of War or the late Tom Clancy games of Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon.There is no innovation of any kind either. Bullet time is stolen from Max Payne, and there's the kind of third person shooting game play we get that's reminiscent from second and third rate games. The stages and levels get old fast. It's the same every few seconds. Go into an area, fight off 50 bad guys, press the left control pad button a few times to heal yourself, and move on. I lost interest after a half of days worth of game play. I think I would rather be strangled to near death than play this game.

6931,59414,AHMO70DRWBE0W,B0009Z3MQK,videogamemaster,"[9, 19]","First let me say I was really looking forward to this game, I bought it on release date and went right home to play it only to find it a big dissapointment compared to Animal Crossing (GCN) of a couple years back.Here are the main things:1. The main (and most frustrating) thing about AC:WW is, unlike it's GCN counterpart you cannot ask the villagers for jobs. It seems they removed (though I've no idea why) the option from the chat menu when you talk to animals. You can still get jobs from animals but it is completely random and happens on occasion when you use the ""Talk to me!"" (or something similiar) when chatting with animals. This was one of the main ways to obtain new items for your catologue on the GCN one, so it's a major letdown.2. Holidays, these were my favorite part of the old one, (halloween, thanksgiving, christmas) they aren't in Wild World, instead they've been replaced by AC themed holidays, ""Yay Day"", ""Flea Market Day"" and ""Flower Fest"" and ""Acorn Day"" to name a few. Beleave me, after two ""Yay Days"" you will be sick of it. Another big dissapointment.3. Touch control and new map design, firstly the touch control, while good to breeze through menus with, I rarely find myself using it for anything else. Though you can use it to move your character (and about everything else) I rarely find myself doing so, it just feels too unnatural. And finaly, the new ""log rolling"" map design. This just doesn't feel right, I could never get used to this, and the removal of ""acres"" from the game, making it nearly impossible to make a perfect town. (Beleave me, I tried.)Minor things:1. The perfect town thing, mentioned above. In AC GCN, it was fairly easy (though granted still one of the games more challenging aspects) to maintain a perfect town for two weeks (thanks to the ""acre system"") and get the infamous golden axe. In WW however, the acres have been removed making it nearly impossible to keep up with what needs to be planted where....2. Nookington's, the two-story department style upgrade to Nookway (also the final upgrade and most desired for its large display of furniture daily (six peices if I remember correctly). This final upgrade requires someone from another town to visit and buy at least 1 item from Nookway.Now, it was terribly simple to get this upgrade in the GCN AC, if you don't have a friend who has a GCN and AC, just buy another memory card, make another town and have that character visit yours. Simplyfying this even more is the fact the AC GCN came with a free memory card 59, meaning that would most likely make your second card (if you didn't have have two or more 59's by then anyway). However, in Wild World someone must visit Nookway via Wi-Fi or LAN. Meaning to get Nookington's you MUST have a friend/relative who has a DS and WW. Or pay about $180 for another DS and AC games. Yikes. Sure you could always get friend codes over the internet but the official Nintendo forums do not allow fc sharing, and asking anywhere else is asking for trouble. These people will come into your town and change your flag with a ""questionable"" design, curse or even bring a virus onto your DS. Ouch.The only real improvement this game makes over the GCN AC is the Wi-fi play, (which is why I gave it three stars), but as stated above, if you do not know anyone who has a DS and AC it could be risky just asking random people online.So, to finish only buy this game if, for some reason you cannot get the GCN one, or you have tons of friends with DS's.",3,Dissapointing,1165881600,"12 12, 2006"

The graphics are nicer and they've added new Pokemon, but not much has changed beyond that. Despite being on the 3DS, we're still not working with a fully 3D environment yet. Instead, they just take the 2D over-world and tilt the camera angle a bit to make it appear less flat. They've added some new pointless and unexciting mechanics like riding Pokemon and Horde Battles (battling 5 Pokemon at once). Nothing revolutionary, of course. Some of it is even just flat out unenjoyable like Super Training, a way to boost your Pokemon's stats by hitting a button over and over again.Since Black and White actually introduced characters and a plot ever so slightly different from the mainstay, I was hoping this game would actually give us some kind of story. Nope. You're still a 10 year old kid who sets out with annoying friends to collect gym badges. This time the evil team's name is Team Flare, and their villain is a huge step back from N and Ghetsis as far as character development goes.The Gym Leaders, Elite Four, and Champion are all ridiculously easy. Pokemon has never been known to be a challenging series but you can just steamroll through everyone in this game.There aren't any memorable locations that come to mind. A lot of rehashes actually, i.e. Virdian Forest 2.0; Team Flare's underground base with teleporters and tiles that whirl you across the floor in one direction; a frozen cave which consists of puzzles based on sliding across ice floors (sound familiar?). As I write this all out it makes me realize just how sadly lazy Gamefreak is....Two stars might be generous given all my bashing, but the 3D models of each of the Pokemon look gorgeous. The only actual portion of the game to take advantage of the 3D aspect of the 3DS is within a Pokemon battle, but the Pokemon do look damn good nonetheless.They've also made some slight, slight changes to improve the competitive aspect of the game, such as preventing weather from being permanent and introducing Fairy type to combat Dragons. It's still terribly balanced, though, and you won't care if you're just going to play the main game and not competitively.If this is your first Pokemon game, by all means play it and have a blast.

Don't miss the cut scenes of Anna Williams and Lee Chaolan, both of which are absolutely hilarious.  All the characters are just awesome.  My favorites are Lee and Asuka, with their lightning-fast, aggressive style.  Feng is also formidable, and difficult to fight against in an advanced mode.  He reminds me of Johnny Cheung's character in the 'Dragon - Bruce Lee Story' movie, in which he played Bruce Lee's nemesis.  The Tekken character 'Bruce' reminds me of Van Damm's nemesis in the movie 'Blood Sport'.The graphics have improved so much that now you can see very subtle expressions on characters' faces.  For example in the cut scene before Nina fights Raven for the first time, the normally stone-cold Nina cracks a smile at the last second, as if trying to flirt. It's ironic that CG action characters are fast becoming better ACTORS than their live human counterparts, e.g. Vin Diesel, Wesley Snipes, etc.The game engine is very advanced, and the player just cannot keep winning with one or two favorite combo moves.  The opponents react and adapt very quickly, and counterattack mercilessly.  It's just wonderful how severely this game punishes a player who underestimates the opponent or who lets down the guard for a split second.One wish would be an ability to better customize the characters.  The customizing interface is rather awkward, both in control and in the character's appearance.  (I mean who fights with a guitar strapped across the back, or wearing a two-foot tall crown of feathers ?)  Instead of offering a series of dumb-looking accessories that hang from the characters, enable customization of hair style and color, clothing, shoes, tattoos, piercings, etc.  'Champions of Norrath - Realms of Everquest' is a good example of such customization.Overall, an awesome game that's a bargain at $50.  You can go to a movie and easily spend $20 for a ticket and snacks and often walk out disappointed after 2 hours.  Tekken 5 will give you weeks' worth of adrenaline pumping action.

I've heard nothing but good things from Astro until the 2013 Edition of the A40s. I really wished I would of looked into this headset more before I made this purchase.What's nice about this headset is the Mixamp. They have four different EQs and it matches pretty much all games. I play Gears of War 3 for the most part, so I keep it on the main EQ. Whenever I play Black Ops 2 or MW3, I use the Pro EQ. They designed it to make gunshots and footsteps louder so it's really nice for sound whoring. The headset itself is very lightweight. I wear glasses and this headset is one of the most comfortable headsets I've owned. The fact that you can disconnect the cords that hook up to the heaset and to the Mixamp is also a good add on. If your cord breaks, you just buy a new one where the old models, (I've never owned before) the cord is attached to the headset. So you don't need to spend $200 on the headset itself.The reason why I gave this a two out of five stars was this:You're buying a faulty product. The power cord they provide is faulty. It doesn't support well with the new Mixamp. They sound would go for about a minute, then just cut off completely. I purchased this at Gamestop and thought I had a broken headset, so I returned it and got a new headset. The same thing happened. At first I thought it was my Xbox Slim that I've had for about a year now, but after doing some research, I've found out it was the cord they provide. Luckily, I found a cord in my room that worked. Also, the microphone output is just ridiculous. People say it's hard to hear what I'm saying because it's so quiet. I had to update the firmware on the Mixamp in order to have a properly working microphone output so they did fix this problem, but it still bugs me.I really love this headset, but if you're spending $250 on a professional gaming headset, you shouldn't have to worry about something little like a cord or microphone output.

Like older versions, you put in residential, commercial, and industrial zones;place police stations, recreational facilities, fire stations, jails, educational facilities,transportation systems, rewards, and landmarks.  However, it is vastly improved over previous versions.  First of all, city services have been expanded upon.  I haven't made it that far in the game yet,(my largest city has about 15,000 people and the region I am working on has about 100,000) but what I have seen so far is simply awesome.  The graphics are incredible!  Please stop complaining and get a new computer.  I have a older model and I have got the brains just to play the game at a freinds house who has a new computer.  The city services is where some massive change has come though.  You can now get large or small police and fire stations, there are now elementary and high schools, beaches have been added as recreational facilities, and many more.  Have problems balancing your budget?  Here is the key:STOP SPENDING TOO MUCH MONEY!  This version is a bit harder because you have too pay for everything, and I admit I had difficulty with this when I first started playing, but with practice I have overcome the problem.  The key to balancing the budget is making a lot of zones.  Once you have a significant tax base, you can add city services.  There is a budget window telling you how much you are making or losing per month, and each building has its cost listed.  There is virtually no excuse for not having a balanced budget other than inexperience.  Trust me, the time you spend trying to master the game is worth it.  It took me about 4 hours to learn how to play it, but since then I have had like over 10 hours of enjoyable time playing it, so it is highly worth it.  And contrary to stupid rumors, it is possible to get scyscrapers in the game.  You merely need to play it to where you have a large population of about 300,000 regional pop with all cities connected and then you need to put in excellent city services.  Sure, it is a pain how you can only get small houses and stores in your residential and commercial zones at first, but it is possible to get larger and larger buildings as you continue to play the game.  And in my opinion this makes the game better, because it forces me to diversify my cities more,it makes the game more realistic(ever seen the empire state building in a town of 5,000?  I don't think so...), it makes the game more challenging, and it gives you a reason to keep playing it.  Don't give up!  You will have that 30 story residential building sooner than you think!  And even before then you get bigger buildings as the game progresses which can help tide you over.  Plus, if you get frusturated or bored, you can always unleash cool disasters like robot attacks, meteors, fires, volcanoes, lightning, etc.  Also, riots occur if you are very unpopular(I must admit I have gotten them before).  To put down disasters, you must send out your regular police, SWAT(you get them when you have a large enough police force), and firefighters.  Also, there is a day night mode thing, where you can see your city in either day or night, and at the start out the game you get to change your terrain and animals in the mode.  To sum it up, this is a awesome edition to the sim city series with great graphics.  My only complaints are:The game requires must processing power, and it can be hard at first.  But never give up!  It's a awesome game, and its worth the time invested to learn how to play it.",4,"Sim City 4, the latest and greatest Sim City.",1110412800,"03 10, 2005"

Personally I like this new style of Sim City, just my personal taste. If you were a fan of Tropico, this will feel vaguely familiar, only 57 (or 58 if you're reading this in 2008) years later. Basically you place roads, houses, places for people to work, and services for the people. So far it's exactly like Tropico. Except that is where Tropico continues to expand, and Sim City Societies just remains at that. Sure you have to continue to build to get new buildings, but there's not much left. In Tropico you had to keep the people happy, foreign nations happy, balance the economy properly, and remain in office. In this game, keeping people happy is simplified to just putting a bunch of services for people next to housing, no foreign nations to keep happy, no economy to balance (you only spend money when you build something, only the amount you make changes), and you can't be ousted as far as I've seen.

It has almost exactly the same platforming system that was in Ubisoft's ""Prince of Persia"" titles.  It then combined that with an art style, map system, combat system and leveling approach that are very similar to ""Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning"".  So for the first 10 or so hours of the game I was having a blast as I worked my way through really fun puzzle environments.Then the game changed.I reached the first world boss and the game suddenly threw out virtually every technique that you've learned and perfected.  Instead, you spend your time galloping around on horseback trying desperately not to get killed while you figure out the obscure mechanic that will let you actually do something. Even once you figure the technique out, you still have to push through frustration trying to make the technique actually work.  It's like you're suddenly playing a totally different game -- something that brings up less than fond memories of the old ""Dragon's Lair"" arcade game.  (Look it up if you've never heard of it.  There's a good reason it faded away while other arcade titles from the same era are still in play.)  After a good hour of this frustration, I ejected the disk rather than give in to my impulses to throw the controller through the TV screen.This is exactly the same reason why I trashed the ""Deus Ex: Human Revolution"" title partway through.  No matter how much I might enjoy the mechanics for 99% of the gameplay, that remaining 1% where they pull a switcheroo on the player completely kills all joy in the title.In the final analysis:  I know a lot of people love this game to death.  (Pun intended.)  But if you're like me and don't like games that periodically put you through exercises in frustration before you can return to the mechanics you do like, stay away from Darksiders II.",2,Bait and Switch,1362441600,"03 5, 2013"

In Saints Row, a game made in 2006 mind you, you'll find yourself sitting on the road in the position you'd be in while driving the car that just dissappeared.In Saints Row you play a guy who doesn't speak at all, and deal with idiotic cutscenes where characters from ""you got served"" try to exploit that for some comedy relief.The storyline is as enthralling as playing the turf war missions in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, because that's pretty much all you do as far as that goes.The challenge in this game isn't simply dodging bullets and driving really fast, it's dealing with unrefined programming code.In a mission where I had to protect someone, they wouldn't get into the vehicle I had for them, simply because the vehicle was on a slope.  Forget the fact that bullets were tearing through his flesh, he just wasn't comfortable getting into a vehicle that was on a slope.While shooting back at gang members at the end of a dead end alley, I was suddenly shot from behind.  Looking behind me, the game placed a car full of gang members directly behind me in that dead end alley.  I died, and at that moment decided to sell this piece of garbage game.There are no motorcycles, boats, or helicopters (that you can pilot).  They put all their effort into the cars, which fell short in my opinion.I encourage anyone interested to rent this game, and prove me wrong by getting excited more often than you want to just throw your controller at the tv.

2681,28719,AGUB2543MVG5E,B000066TS5,San Fran Gruuv Fan,"[1, 1]","While growing up, I adored Disney......before the 1984 takeover by Michael ""Scrooge"" Eisner, that is.I watched heartbroken as a teenager studying to enter the cartoon industry while Eisner proceeded to very quickly transmute one of my favourite studios into a nightmare. And at first, it didn't look like there would be much of a problem regarding the animated films since Roy was in charge of them, but finally The New Disney animation staff suddenly became so ""modern"", ""up to date"" and ""trendy"" that something has been seriously lost for something gained. Disney hasn't released anything genuinely beautiful with their animation releases since ""Beauty and The Beast"", as far as I'm concerned. Since then, it's been anime ripoffs, gross-out jokes and sarcasm designed to slap the lyrical poetic beauty of traditional Disney in the face several times over. Disney has gone Hollywood, and Eisner has sold out Walt's beloved legacy for the common dollar.So I haven't exactly been looking forward to anything new bearing the Disney logo these days. I no longer rush to the theatres to check out their latest, I can no longer trust their brand name as I was once able to. And whenever I buy anything Disney, it's either their old films I grew up with or collectibles I once owned as a child.When I one day saw this new game title, KINGDOM HEARTS, in my local store... well, I wasn't sure what to think. On the one hand, it's cover gave me the impression that it was something I would have personally wanted to create back when I was 15 (I also enjoy anime at its most poetic). But on the other, it was The New Disney. But out of curiosity, I decided to rent it at my local Hollywood Video just to give it a try. No harm in that.As I said before, The New Disney is simply too determined to be ""cool"" to do anything meaningful. What a geuinely wonderful surprise, then, that KINGDOM HEARTS--a ***VIDEOGAME***, for pete's sake!--turns out to be such a beautiful piece of work that it ends up being the sort of ""new Disney film"" I've been waiting for the studio to create ever since ""Beauty and The Beast"". Yes, it is true that the story won't win any awards for originality. But this one is handled so lovingly and with such sensitivity in the tradition of both classic Disney and my favourite anime dramas that it proves the old addage of how it's not always the story itself but how the tale is told that counts. This is a highly noncommercial creation, and that's what allowed its creators on both sides to drop all marketing nonsense and simply create something they loved. In all honesty, though, not everyone is going to love the story--jaded gamers who hate sensitivity in their entertainment in particular. But once the story got started by around the fourth world or so, I was swept away by it. I daresay that those of us old enough to know the Old School Disney will appreciate this far more than younger generations. I don't want to give away its details, but I just want to say that sensitive players will be enraptured by it, especially since the game as a whole has an underlining wistful undercurrent of time gone by for both the characters and the players at the controls. It will make you sigh and think, ""Oh yeah, that was the innocence of my youth and Disney from way back when...""The animation is gorgeous, and the art direction is imaginative. It also has a highly effective interface which isn't at all confusing, one of the most fantastic realtime cameras for a game I've ever seen, a FANTASTIC soundtrack (also available here on Amazon.com, from my understanding!) and the game as a whole also allows you to relive a childhood fantasy even if it does involve a few new Disney references. Have you ever wanted to personally clobber Jafar? Or how about Captain Hook? You'll get your chance.One of the best examples of the game's overall effect occurred with the climax of the Neverland world, a sequence which is worth the hefty price tag alone. In this finale sequence, you have nothing to fight... you're flying lightheartedly over London in circles around Big Ben as pixie dust sparkles all around you and soaring music gracefully underlining the beauty without a bit of the effect seeming forced. It was my childhood dream to be able to soar over London with Peter Pan, and because the effect was SO gorgeous... and, bless his heart, Goofy looks like he's having the time of his life here and enjoying it every bit as much as I did... that I found myself laughing happy with tears of joy pouring down my cheeks as the game was taking me back to an innocent youthful fantasy.If I sound like I'm a huge fan of this game, it's because I am. Simply put, I have fallen in love with it and consider it a title to treasure, as it is not only the best new game I've played last year but also one of the absolute best gaming experiences I have ever enjoyed in my entire life. Period. Both children and adults will have a blast.Complaints? Well, I do have a few. I wish they had put in a few more ""traditional film"" worlds as opposed to so many newer ones that we've had pumped down our throats so much during the last decade (""Aladdin"", ""The Little Mermaid"", etc.), but maybe they'll do more in a sequel. At least one of the areas in one of the worlds looks flat out embarrassing (the trial area in Wonderland, which simply looks like a giant painted cube without even the attempt to create an illusion of depth as with elsewhere... inexcusable considering the high quality of the other areas in this game) and breaks the illusion for a while. Also, while most of the sound is brilliant, the few attempts when they do try to put in cartoonish sound effects for Donald and Goofy, such as an early cutscene when Donald moves and blinks his eyes while reading a letter, sound inexcusably clunky and cheap considering the game's otherwise excellent sound, and they're more befitting DIC Enterprises than a masterful studio like Disney. And as far as I can tell, there is no way to bypass the cutscenes, some of which are huge, which means that you'll often have to sit through huge cutscenes before every single time you attempt to pass a boss battle until you finally beat it.Let's not get off on the wrong track, though. This is one of the few times when the universe surprises us with something that manages to surpass even the hype machine that accompanies it. And if Walt had ever lived long enough to see videogames, I genuinely believe he would have been proud of KINGDOM HEARTS. A must-own title for anyone, and I personally found it worth the purchase of a PS2 alone just to play it. It's going to be a long time before I encounter another game experience as wonderful as this mini-masterpiece.",5,The sort of beathtaking magic that Disney no longer does.,1045008000,"02 12, 2003"

Wireless Xbox 360 controllers WILL NOT WORK NO MATTER WHAT! UNLESS you buy a receiving dongle for the controller which cost around $20 dollars. That is the only way it will ever work because Xobox 360 wireless controllers do not use bluetooth.When you power on the console you'll need internet to setup the system, Wi-fi or by ethernet.

It came out soon after and, in a way, it shows.  Don't get me wrong.  Im not going as far as to say that this is an unnecessary sequal.  This game is still quite a bit of fun with a group of friends and if you haven't played the first game then this is definitely the one you should get.

We played through all the levels and none of us felt the need to go back through and start again.  It just felt a little bit like we were playing the same game.  The new game modes didn't really interest us either.I still think this is a good game and worth playing with up to four people.

I'll start with the good: the atmosphere of this game is great- very creepy.  An old Irish castle after dark is bound to be spooky, and indeed it is.  The graphics when inside the castle are also fantastic- high resolution, lots of detail.  You really feel like you're in the castle.  Part of the castle has been blown up, and it was never really clear why someone was staying in a room with half the roof missing, but we'll hold that thought until we get to the plot.  Other pluses of this game- it's a fairly long game to get through, and some of the puzzles were quite challenging.On to the negatives: the most important one is the plot.  Quite simply, there isn't much plot- Nancy is searching for her friend's missing fiance, but beyond that, we get little plot development.  On the same note, I found the ending to be quite unsatisfactory.  I don't want to give anything away, so I won't go into to detail, and will just say that the ending severely interfered with my enjoyment of the castle's atmosphere.  Also, I was unhappy with the outdoor navigation in this game.  Outside the castle the player controls Nancy from above, meaning that the graphics are quite simplistic, and it's more like an arcade game than a mystery.  I much prefer to see the game through Nancy's eyes.  In sum, Nancy Drew addicts will definitely want to play this game, and there are certainly things to recommend here, but it's not one of the better Nancy Drew games.

There are sections where I could not put down my controller wanting to finish the next suspenseful part. I'll probably be the strange one and state I enjoyed the desert part.

The addition of a split screen option is a very nice touch. I've always enjoyed how easy the Uncharted games play so I have 0 problems with wanting to play it with a buddy on the same screen.

1562,173977,AUWK3MHVDB0MR,B004L4AZ3I,Michael King,"[6, 6]","Deciding whether to purchase this game was originally a hard decision. I really wasn't finding very much on the internet about it, and what I did find seemed to be negative for the most part. I ended up getting this game used for $10, and have to say that at this price point, I have found the game to be enjoyable and worth picking up and playing through, especially for anyone who likes flat out high speed racing games.The game basically consists of 14 leagues that feature 4 races against multiple drivers and 1 duel (a race against one other driver). Each race also features two bonus challenges per race (don't crash, pick up a certain percentage of power ups, crash the leader, don't alert the police etc...) which means each league consists of essentially 15 things to do (5 races to win first place in and 10 bonus challenges to accomplish). Some of the races I found that I not only won first place but also accomplished both of the bonus challenges at the same time on my first run, thus completing everything I needed to do for that particular race in the respective league. Other races I have bonus challenges that are still not done, even after trying to complete them multiple times (much of the challenge in completing these bonus challenges is entailed in the negatives below). Having just completed the career mode (meaning I have won first place in all the races for each of the 14 leagues) I am going back now and trying to finish up all the unfinished bonus challenges as well. Currently I have 23 bonus challenges left, spread throughout multiple leagues. The most challenging accomplishments seem to be not crashing, especially on the races where there are very narrow tight passageways and blind curves. When you get up in the faster leagues, avoiding an oncoming car you can't see and can barely avoid gets to be quite frustrating.When I got this game used, I noticed that the previous owner had only played it up to the first few levels (then apparently got rid of it). I thought that was going to be a really bad sign. I cleared everything off the memory card and started over and found myself pretty much getting stuck at around the same place. My sticking point was the vigilante race (where you have to take out a certain number of racers by crashing them into the wall or ramming them using your hyperspeed boost). I looked on the internet for helps and strategy guides but found almost nothing on this game. Thankfully I kept playing and finally figured out how to accomplish this. From what I've found, the best strategy seems to be either to get along side another car and nudge them over into the railing, or load up your nitro bar until it is full and get behind another car and hit the boost...which then sends you hurdling through the car as you ram them. The races end as soon as you take out the specified number of cars, so there really is no need to try and be in first place, just try to stay where the majority of cars are huddled together and work on those strategies. It also helps if you get your nitro meter filled up and wait until you go into a tight section of the track with other racers in front of you. If you try to ram cars using your nitro boost in a wide open area, I often found that they were very good at manouvering out of your way and you would waste your nitro boost. If this ever happens, you can hit the brake and your remaining nitro will be saved....there is no need to leave the hyperspeed boost going and use all the nitro you have.As I played through this game, I felt like I figured out some of the reasons why it got such low ratings. The other racers in the game pretty much always seemed to have stronger faster cars than you and must have an endless supply of nitro boosts as they were constantly pulling away from me if I ever hit a minor slow down and it would take me at least half or more of a lap to catch up with them. This seemed really unbalanced. You could literally see the other cars blast away from you at 4-5x your speed, even if they had hit the same slow down you did. It's also frustrating that if the police come out, they seem completely oblivious to the other racers all around you that are also tearing through the streets and just gang up on you. In any race where the police come out, they are pretty much just annoying and can often cost you a race as they relentlessly push you into the walls, which slows you down quite a bit. Not only do the top racers seem to have cars with fully ramped up acceleration, endless nitro boosts and top speed, but they also seem to be masters at swerving in and out of traffic and rarely crashing. Granted, I did just complete the career mode (meaning I won first place in every race in every league), but it was still kind of annoying the difference between your car and the others. And if you think that just earning some more money so you can buy a faster car with better handling will help, it doesn't. Essentially I came to the conclusion that the AI determines what car you have, with what upgrades etc...at the beginning of the race and then ensures that the top cars you are racing agiainst are just a little bit better. This was most noticeable when I beat the game in career mode, had purchased the fastest car with the best handling, upgraded it with every upgrade available in the game, then went back to race some of the first leagues to complete some of the bonus challenges I had open. I thought for sure this was going to be a breeze....but I was sadly mistaken. The other racers were miraculously still just a little bit faster and better with endless boosts and it was a very challenging race. Some other things I noticed was that the frame rate suffers at some points which makes it challenging to drive, and there was one point where I took a shortcut that had me flying over a ravine, and when you land on the other side, your car essentailly just comes to a complete stop and sits there for 3-4 seconds, even though you are still pushing the gas and all the other cars are racing past you. It made me bust out laughing as it happens every time you take that shortcut and just looks completely ridiculous. Thankfully everything kicks in and you are suddenly shot out from that spot at full speed and it's just more of a visual and pacing annoyance, rather than a huge performance breaker for the race. Each league has a drift race too, which I found in many ways to be bizarre and a skill that was really not worth perfecting. These races require you to get enough drift points before you cross the finish line. It doesn't matter if you finish last place, just as long as you get enough drift points. Drifting is pretty much worthless during races unless you have very very tight curves as drifting always seems to drop your top speed down very low (unlike Ridge Racer where you can drift and maintain top speeds at the same time). So in the middle of a fast race, if you go into a drift, it can pretty much mean you losing your position and needing to take 1/2 to 3/4 of a lap to try and catch back up again. So in the end, I'm not really sure what the drift races were all about, as I was never going to use the technique in real races and they seemed a little absurd and more of just something different to do in each league to break you away from straight out racing.I think this game could have been really really stellar if some of these issues were tweaked just a little more. I really liked many of the techno music tracks in the game and thought the sense of speed was great. The game kept me engaged and playing, which is always a good sign. My general strategy was to just play through all the races in each league trying to get first place, then moving on to the next race etc... If I ever reached a point where I didn't get first place, I went to see if a new faster and more agile car had unlocked, at which point I would upgrade and outfit it with all the upgrades that were unlocked and available at that point. Usually I could then go on to win at least 8-9 more races until I had to repeat this. Despite the unfair differences mentioned above, it was addicting to win the races, see your level upgrading and unlocking new cars. I think the developers did a great job of dialing this in. So far I have put in 16 hours into the game and am thinking it may be another 2 hours maybe to finish all the bonus challenges.I think Asphalt 3D would be a good title for anyone who enjoys games of just outright high speed racing, collecting power ups and who doesn't mind leaning to drift, even though it's not very useful in the races.",3,Asphalt 3D,1329696000,"02 20, 2012"

5583,158633,A1GKZX6RMO8QO6,B003O6G47U,Sadie Jane,"[4, 7]","I was so excited for this latest installment of Silent Hill. The series is my most favorite for it's atmosphere, twisted plot lines, and horror. This however, had no atmosphere, no horror, and a jumbled mess of a plot that I could have cared less about.Reading the description about the game I thought, wow, this is going to be awesome! How could being an escaped convict in Silent Hill not be fun? I always liked the prisons in the game and the atmosphere and doom that they had so I linked that to the main character, Murphy. Maybe that is why I'm so disappointed. Once you get to the prison at the end of the game it is nothing like any of the other ones in the series. It's not scary, it's not fun, it's redundant and more of a chore than anything. I would say this is a theme for the entire game.My husband and I played this together since we are both fans and we've replayed all the other games numerous times. I was obsessed with SH3 and beat it with all the endings and was down to about 2 hours. I loved replaying those games. This one, I will not touch again. It's so sad.On with the facts. The town if full of detail. So much so that you'll be thinking that you can pick everything up but you can't. There are plenty of melee weapons around but they break eventually usually during a fight and then you are left with your fists or gun (if you haven't lost it one of the numerous times that you do). But even though there was much detail in the town it didn't feel Silent Hill. I'm not sure why. It's not as foggy as the other portrayals, not as dark. It's just missing the scare factor. Monsters are annoying and repetitive. You'll mostly bump into screamers (women) who we found to be the most difficult to deal with in the entire game for their sheer annoyance. You don't get many shells for your guns so you don't want to waste them on these basic monsters but sometimes you sacrificed just to get it over with.As for the monsters, there was not much variety. I didn't bother to find out what they are all labeled but I think there are only 6 different monsters in the entire game that you encounter over and over again making it just tedious. Maybe it would be different if they were scary but there was nothing special or different about any of them. There were the women screamers who appeared in bloody dresses; male equivalents who went shirtless and had metal caging on their heads; tall and dull alien hunchbacks with no features; larger shirtless men who were more difficult than the small ones; the mannequin/dolls/shadow fighters who are just as annoying as the screamers; and ""spitters"" who were attached to the walls and spit at you. None of these characters were interesting or spooky. They are no nurses, that's for sure.And the so called ""void"" that you encounter randomly that is supposed to be intense is just a black hole type thing that you have to run from or else if it catches up to you and you don't get out of its way you die. Not very scary or inventive. You run and run until it disappears for no reason without much difficulty so again, it's just tedious.Spoiler Alert!The bosses are non existent except for the last one at the end who was incredibly easy to defeat. I'm guessing he was supposed to be Frank lashing out at Murphy for crippling him. Murphy simply has to get to the top of each of his four breathing apparatuses to shine the light on the monster and then go down while he is stunned and pull each of the four breathing tubes out. THE END. Lame.Other than this boss I can't recall any others. You encounter a large figure with a gas mask on throughout the game but you never actually fight him and eventually you become him for a useless encounter with one of the prison guards who has been following you through the game. You can simply let her shoot you to death if you wish. It may affect the ending you get but I'm just trying to make the point that we felt pretty blah about everything going on and could really care less about what ending we got. Though the one we did get was terrible and ended awkwardly. If we had enjoyed the game we would replay it to get all the endings.Upon some research we found out there is an ending where Murphy tunnels under the prison and up through into the cafeteria where classic Silent Hill characters are attending a surprise birthday party for him! We looked this ending up on youtube and geez, it was better than the ENTIRE game! But I wouldn't play this game again to get it. Just watch it online.Side quests! Ahhhhhhhh! Side quests! So many side quests. They were annoying, pointless, and didn't add anything to the game. Release all the birds... really? Who thought this crap up? Everything is so scattered too and spread across what seems to be 3 towns that it is a hassle to even want to stray from the main story line to complete these garbage quests. I'm ok with some random, spooky sides that lead you to little Easter eggs or awesome hidden weapons but the point is that they have a POINT and they don't take you so far out of the main story that you can't tell what you are doing anymore. The side quests in this game were pointless and there were TOO MANY. This a survival horror game, stick to the weird, intense main story line. Maybe if they had spent more time developing atmosphere and story instead of terrible side quests the game would have been awesome.Puzzles.... terribly dull.I guess I've done enough complaining. The one thing that I have to commend about this Silent Hill is the voice acting. Murphy's acting is great, as are the rest of the characters but that doesn't save the game. This is the only reason this game got 2 stars from me.So to wrap it up even though this is called Silent Hill it doesn't feel like it. There's too much going on outside the main plot which is already a confused mess. The monsters are boring. The ""void"" is lame. There is nothing nightmarish about this game. I never jumped or even thought, ""Wow, that was inventive"". I loved SH3 so much because that entire game was alive. The walls were breathing and you could feel it, it was dooming and depressing. You would have to stand back and take it all in. The nightmare world was just that- walls covered in flesh and blood, things getting weirder and weirder.

Lame.  I am not impressed.*You need to play the original first.  Otherwise you miss the humor here.  The controls and everything are the exact same as the first. **** ""Completely new gameplay mechanics"", as mentioned above, is an outright LIE. The game plays EXACTLY like the original - no new controls or anything here. *****The game is annoying and repetitive.  Mainly, you are literally SWARMED by hordes of undead.  The original design of the game wasn't meant to handle 10 people attacking you at once, so it's utterly annoying and frustrating to fend them off.  You have to always try and climb up on something to keep them from attacking you, which isn't easy since they quickly surround you and kill you.  You can only kill them with headshots, and since your deadeye is limited, this is pretty frustrating.  You can't buy Ammo, so you're always worrying about running out.  Or running out of deadeye.  You'll die a LOT.  And when you do, your only restart options BOTH leave you with whatever amount of ammo you had left when you died!!  ANNOYING.*Poor game design: After the initial game intro, I happened back to my ""home"" where a little cut scene showed John not going into the house and a woman's voice saying ""Remember what I told you John"".  HUH!?!!?  NO I DON'T remember, because nothing like that happened in the game!  BAD design.  I notice a lot of other inconsistencies with the writing:*MORE poor game design:  I rope a mythical creature!  Hooray!  I'm told it's one of the 4 horses of the apocalypse - named Pestilince.  ""Pestilince is nearly impossible to kill"" it says.  1 minute later, slide down an embankment, horse dies.  Good job.  John lives, of course.  But this is another example of a dumb, poorly completed game idea.  This game was made by overweight programmers in the minutes they had to spare in between designing the original and playing Call of Duty 4.*All you do is worry about conserving your ammo, and trying not to die.  It's not nearly as fun as the original.  Bad execution of an OK idea.  Story isn't much, and it's pretty quick to complete.  I think there was maybe a dozen or less actual ""missions"" I had to complete to win the game.  Weak ending - I thought it would have a better end, but it was dumb.  In fact, there is no ""ending"" - no end credits, nothing.

His girlfriend Jennifer has been kidnapped (the plot of every beat-em-up ever) by the maniacal Doctor West. A mask topples out of a nearby sarcophagus, it speaks to him, promising an extension to his life, and, more importantly, revenge. Upon donning the mask, Rick is not transformed into a green-faced party animal in a yellow suit, but a muscle-bound raging hulk ready to take on any monsters the West Mansion has to offer. There's plenty of splatter, and plenty of house, so, if nothing else, it certainly lives up to the title.Fortunately there IS a lot more to enjoy. Splatterhouse is probably the bloodiest game of all time and is a great beat-em-up, but it does begin to wither by your third play-through. The gameplay is very. very similar to that ofBatman Arkham Asylum, though nowhere near as polished. And a lot of Rick abilities are similar to that of Alex Mercer fromPROTOTYPE). It's no secret that the game had a troubled production. Bottle Rocket Games was fired (and rendered defunct as a result) by Namco around early 2009, and it took Namco's in-house team nearly a year and a half to fill in the rest. The game still feels rushed and unfinished. The biggest problem lies with the fact that the game does not install to your PS3, but merely loads off the Blu Ray disc. This creates very, very long loading times that will REALLY drive you mad.

From what I see, it's either you enjoy wrestling and love this game, or you hate/couldn't care less about wrestling and you don't. I happen to be in the latter category, and so I feel that there is nothing about this game that I really enjoy. I really don't think there are anything in this game that would appeal to other non-wrestling-fans except for the fact that it is easy to pick up and play. Being a non-wrestling fan, I don't really understand what exactly the crowd meter thingy is for. You could be beating the life out of the opposing wrestler, yet your relation with the crowd is relatively low. I highly doubt that any other non-wrestling-fans would know what it is either.That is not to say that there is nothing fun about this game. As I said, the game is very easy to pick up and play. After a few rounds of button mashing, you would be able to figure out that A is to grapple and do whatever other attacks you have, and B is to just beat the living crud out of each and every one of your opponents. Yet if you are not familiar with how to end a match, then you'll likely just attack for a while until your opponent gets seriously bloody. Constantly pressing B just to turn your opponent into a bloody mess gets old if you keep on doing it for several minutes. And controlling characters on a semi-3D environment just does not feel natural. Sure, I don't mind the fact that the game keeps you locked onto an opponent at all times, but it is moving around that gets tedious.WWF No Mercy was probably the most realistic wrestling game back in 2000. There are authentic entrances with authentic entrance music as well as authentic game modes. Yet to be completely honest, I don't really care. The graphics are more gritty and realistic than Asmik Ace and Aki's previous two wrestling games (1998's WCW/nWo Revenge and 1999's WWF Wrestlemania 2000), and the characters models don't look like faces painted on blobs like earler wrestling games. In other words, they actually look like people this time around. However, they still don't look very good. Stephanie McMahon looks like a zombie, or somebody really ugly wearing a lot of makeup. Crowds are no better than previous Asmik Ace/AKI wrestling games. They don't look like cardboard anymore, but they are just really ugly, really pixelated sprites instead. Sound effects are a bit laughable. It's just ""BOOM! KAPAM KAPOW!"" Yeah. It's not that I have anything against this game, but I just don't find it that good. It still is the best of the Asmik Ace/Aki wrestling games. Maybe I would appreciate it more if I actually watch wrestling.

Because I didn't think much of Sly 1 I didn't bother to play Sly 2 and Sly 3. When the Sly collection was announced with all the HD amenities the God of War collection received, I was thrilled at the opportunity to play the series again. I'm glad I did because Sly offers some of most interesting/entertaining platformers for the PS3.The best part about this collection is the HD graphics. The game's visuals are completely cleaned up, refined, and clear as crystals. It's amazing what anti-aliasing and 720p graphics can do to an old game, the Sly collection could be comparable to what's available on the PSN. I actually think the improved resolution and graphics update makes the collection look better than most of the downloadable PSN games available now.Sly 1: This is Sly's first adventure and it's basically a platformer. Sly is in search of his family's secret book, which was stolen by a gang of villains, with the help of his childhood friends Bently the turtle and Murray the Hippo. Players will jump, swing, hop, sneak, and attack through the whole game searching for Sly's Thievious Raccoonus book. But it's not all about Sly too, there are instances in the game where players will drag race as Murray, ride a hover craft, shoot cannons, and even play an asteroid like shooter as Bently. It's not completely balanced and varied but these minor changes to the game gives the player a breath of fresh air.Sly 2: Sly's second adventure has him traveling around the world in search of new Villains because they each have a part of Clockwerk, Sly's main nemesis from the 1st game. Sly 2 is a completely whole departure from the 1st game. Even though the game has platforming actions, it plays more like a limited sandbox than a platformer. Unlike the first game where players travel location to location, then play levels within each location, Sly 2 has the player doing everything in each location. The locations are also 3 times larger than the first and players can do whatever they want. Objectives are given within the main base and everything is streamlined within each location. Think of it as a smaller version of GTA. Besides the sandbox approach, the game is completely balanced and refined because you will be able to play as Bently and Murray. Yes your entire team is playable now, and each character has their own sets of special abilities and moves.Sly 3: Sly's third adventure has him enlisting new members to help him retrieve treasures and secrets in his family's vault. Sly 3 is pretty much a mixture of Sly 1 and 2. All the same gameplay mechanics are there, the only difference is the locations are bigger than Sly 2 and there are more varied segments. And unlike Sly 2 where most of the gameplay consists of action segments, Sly 3 has more mini game segments such as piloting air planes, controlling remote RC cars, playing with fireworks etc.As much fun as the Sly collections is it still has its fair share of problems. I've encounter audio sync issues within the game where the sound will have static noise on and off. It rarely happens but it still happens non the less. I also must be spoiled by all the Pixar and Dreamworks 3d movies because Sly's character animation is atrocious. Whenever the character speaks they jerk their head, arms, and hands after every other word. It's as if they were being animated with puppeteers like Jim Henson's Muppets. It was actually giving me a headache watching the characters interact with each other. I don't understand why all the main characters in Sly had the same voice actors except for Carmelita Fox. Her voice actor/character for Sly 1 was the best. Her character for Sly 2 is by far the worst! Not only did she loose her Latin accent, but she was portrayed as a bungling side kick always 3 steps behind everyone. Her third voice actor for Sly 3 was okay but once again not like the first. Then there's the issue of the slow down in Sly 3. It happens when there are a lot of characters on screen, not often but as much as the audio sync issue. I also found the controls for Sly 3 to be sluggish and non responsive sometimes. This could just be me, but it just didn't feel as smooth and exact as the first 2 games.I was surprised to find out the 3d option for Sly applied to all 3 games. I had originally thought it was only for Sly 3 because the PS2 version had 3d only for Sly 3. But to my detriment, the 3d option was completely worthless. It felt tacked on, its only effect was the menu screen and the conversation screen through the binoculars. It also caused a lot of aliasing with game when turned on especially with the 3d depth turned to maximum. You could get a perfect example of how bad the 3d is by watching Clash of the Titans in 3d. The Move mini games was interesting to me. Keep in mind I played everything with the controller because I don't own the move. I don't think mini game is worthless, I actually had fun playing them and I can imagine a group of friends doing so too. These type of shallow motion waggle is good for party games just like the craze that was Wii sports.All in all, I think the Sly collection is a fun and great game. For less than $10 each players can have all 3 games in the Sly collection in updated HD graphics, trophy support, and to an extent 3d gaming. It's not perfect but its still fun.",4,Better on PS3,1304812800,"05 8, 2011"

The game crashes regularly on my PS3 (an issue that was carried forward from the last installment of Fall Out as well as Morrowind). The game adds a couple of features beyond the first Fall Out by Bestheda, but doesn't really push the series to any new places. You can now craft items, mod weapons with a couple of attachments per weapon (for example, scopes or silencers), and the allies functionality is improved over the last Fall Out. However, it is worth noting that my allies both went wonky in a sewer and I can't seem to get them back. One is trapped between a door and some water and won't dislodge herself despite reloading, while the other (Ed-E a floating Robot) has simply disappeared in the sewer as well. I assume he is trapped somewhere, but don't really want to put the time into trying to locate the little guy. Really frustrating and inexcusably sloppy for a game of this calibre. The game's graphics are on the dated side and look exactly like the original Fall Out 3 which was released a couple of years ago. This probably should have been an expansion pack on not a full game.

It has been a class act with gameplay, fun and characters that everyone loves from Mario and Luigi and Toad, as gamers race across boards trying t master challenges and compete against the simplest of games.The games have done well for Nintendo's home consoles over the years, the Wii, NIntendo 64 and Nintendo Gamecube, with bridging and interactive fun with others in board games that are absolutely fun and challenging. But, the feeling couldn't be said for the handheld systems. They have been heavily overlooked for the NIntendo DS, and Game Boy Advance through the years, and people never gave it the drive to succeed. Now, a new party has finally reached the Nintendo 3DS, and the question is that is it worth it for this party? The answer is yes with the roll of the dice.Mario Party: Island Tour takes in on the fun as you play with as many as 3 other friends through 7 different game boards, and a whole lot of fun in the game. The game takes on the fun that works well just like the classic Mario fun as you play with Mario, Yoshi, Luigi and Boo among others. There are many great games for you to play where you can test the fun of the NIntendo 3DS action from goomba wrangling to slot car racing. There are 80 great mini-games to play and each one is fun with others well. There are also great game boards to play on from scaling Banzai Bill's Mountain, to going through a road to the finish on the stars in the Rocket Road, all the way up to scaling Bowser's tower of fury as you try and get to face him through a fierce showdown. The game plays nicely on the 3DS with good graphics, but doesn't have as well-rendered graphics on the 3D effect. It works well in fun on the Nintendo 2DS too. The control works well on the stylus, but the tilt controls on some games takes a bit of practice to get used to on some games, but can easily be mastered with time. The multiplayer works nicely with others, but could've had a bit more challenge as it could've included online gameplay through Wi-Fi, but that hasn't happened yet.All in all, what you have gotten with Mario Party over the past 2 decades of games from Nintendo, you absolutely have definitely captured fun. While the games have had a lot of highs, and some strong lows, it has always a great centerpiece with interactive board game fun. There have been knockoffs that failed, but Mario still reigns supreme in on the fun. I absolutely recommend Mario Party: Island Tour not only because it is a good game with others, there has been a real lack of great games fr the Nintendo 3DS this past year, but this works well with others. This island hopping will work well for your Nintendo 3DS library.Graphics: BSound: B 1/2+Control: B 1/2+Fun & Enjoyment: solo play B 1/2+; multiplayer BOverall: B",4,Roll Of The Dice,1385078400,"11 22, 2013"

There are some Kinect games that have forsaken the awful motion menu system. Kinect Party automatically starts up with fun content and switches game content all by it's lonesome.

Then the game forces my kids to guide the tiny white hand onto a game mode. Then they have to again guide the tiny white hand to the start button.

Reneau ""Mound of Wires""","[11, 12]","What do you get when you take a series that is virtually flawless and endlessly addicting and combine it with a developer who is known for ruining a virtually flawless and endlessly addicting series? You get a recipe for disaster. Fortunately, Neversoft, the studio responsible for the rise and fall of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series, has decided to take that recipe and throw it out the window. Since acquiring the rights to the Guitar Hero name, Activision has seen to it that Neversoft be in charge of creating all future games in the franchise. And for a built-from-scratch first effort, they succeeded beyond my wildest expectations! Guitar Hero III not only continues the tradition of great music rhythm games, but it adds in some much needed features and game modes that really make it a must-own for any Xbox 360 owner!First off, let's discuss the changes that Neversoft made to the game. The art direction in general takes a much more ""hardcore"" approach, as characters like Judy Nails go from being sweet little rocker chick to big-breasted, pierced alt rocker. Most of the other characters have undergone similar changes, most of which are for the worse. The original games had a very cartoony type of image to it, and Neversoft tries to recreate that with more edge, but they end up looking like they're trying too hard to make the game hardcore. Fortunately, this is a music game so graphics will ultimately take a back seat to the gameplay and music.Gameplay-wise, Guitar Hero III picks up where II left off. New game modes have been introduced into the series, including Co-Op Career (a long-needed mode that features songs you can only unlock through it) and Battle Mode, which allows you to gain attacks (rather than star power) which you can then launch at your opponent to make them fail a song. The last person standing wins! The first time through this mode can be daunting, but after a while it quickly becomes a welcomed addition to the franchise! Also included this time around is full Xbox Live support for Face Off, Pro Face Off, Co-Op, and Battle Mode (unfortunately Co-Op career is not available for online play at this time). The system works great too, and in my dozens of matches online, I've only experienced brief lag once. There's something thrilling about going to battle with someone you've never met and throroughly embarassing them! This feature was well worth the wait, and will undoubtedly add hours upon hours of play to an already addicting game.Of course, the real strength of a music rhythm game will always rest in its soundtrack. Fortunately for us, Guitar Hero III rocks one of the most comprehensive and diverse soundtracks ever put in a video game. Neversoft has finally figured out what Harmonix never could; you can have difficult songs on the game that aren't metal (i.e. Muse's ""Knights of Cydonia"" or QotSA's ""3s and 7s"")! Add in the fact that a large portion of these songs are master recordings, and the game's music just sky-rockets to a whole new level! And while Gutar Hero III's soundtrack is clearly the best in the series, it is not without it's missteps either. For example, ""Sabotage"" by the Beastie Boys is a great song, but it really doesn't belong here as there's very little guitaring going on in the song. Overall though, the diverse collection of songs in the game almost assures it's acceptance by those who may have been hesitant in the past, as there's definitely something for everyone!My complaints with the game are few. My largest gripe is the new Red Octane wireless controller which is very pretty, but has given myself and other gamers some problems. For me specifically, some of the fret buttons will occasionally stop working during a song and you'll need to stop playing, disconnect the controller, and reconnect it for it to work again. This is a huge drawback, but hopefully they can get the bugs worked out in later models. Another small complaint is the lack of a matchmaking system for online play. I play on expert, but I'm more of a low-mid range expert who doesn't stand a chance versus someone who's been playing the game for a few years now. In the end, however, these complaints really overshadow what is a phenomenal game and a great first effort for Neversoft. I highly recommend it to anyone who may be on the fence about it. $99 for a video game is steep, but the hours and hours of enjoyment you'll undoubtedly get out of Guitar Hero III are well worth the price.

Basically gearbox software about two years ago started showing some demos of this game that they were working on. And those demos looked amazing I mean fans of the Alien series were blown away. I will link below a YouTube video where you can see a comparison of the demo and the game that was released and it's a sad thing to see what this game became.Search this video on YouTube: 6lGXDM3LGnkNow as a game it's kind of a mess the graphics are not that great on console or PC and is really just an average first-person shooter. But if your Aliens fan and you long to go back to LV-426 that it might be worth your hard-earned cash to do so. It's nice to hold the M40-1A pulse rifle and gun down Xenomorphs like a complete bad ass. And it does build on the alien mythos and is an extension of Aliens and acknowledges some of the events of Alien 3 (which if you're an Aliens fan could be good or bad in your opinion -  if you are an Aliens fan you should watch Alien 3 special edition it is a lot better than the theatrical cut). I would personally wait until this game pits about $20 maybe even $10 (and trust me by the way it was reviewed and the scores and got it won't take long to reach that price point) then I think it might be worth jumping in if you're just sort of a fan of the series.I would like to note that the multiplayer is kind of cool and it's better than it's ever been in any previous games. But the problem you'll have is that since everybody hates the game multiplayer isn't that have a really large population for very long. I will update this review in the future letting you know about how the multiplayer matchmaking is working.All in all I would only recommend this game if you're a hard-core fan of the series/movies and one a little bit more of the story arc. But be warned if you're just a so-so fan of the series there are a lot better purchases for games out there.I just hope someday in the future gearbox releases the aliens demo that they showed because that's the game we all deserved and the game that would've put right all the countless alien games that have totally sucked.

This is fine except I wanted more control. Some levels require precise jumping and tilting the world doesn't provide that precision. There are underwater levels that feel the same way, but I really enjoyed the mini-games however, they were short lived and only last seconds. The goal is to get to the end of the level while collecting pickories, fruits to make yourself bigger, and knocking out and Moja along the way. You can help out creatures by having enough fruits and using a pretty simple rhythm mini-game to earn rewards. These rewards come in pieces to help build the Mui Mui's giant treehouse. This is great for kids, but as an adult this is just kind of boring and feels useless.The game uses physics for everything and it works well enough, but just feels a bit floaty. The boss fights are extremely difficult and I couldn't get past the second main boss. The jumping mechanics just aren't precise enough for this, but it doesn't make it a bad game. You have to use momentum to be able to jump up high so tilting left and right until you get enough speed then jumping becomes tedious. You get used to it, but I just couldn't shake the feeling. After about 10 levels you start getting bored with the game, especially if you already played the first. I kept expecting new stuff to happen, but it was all the same. The level's difficulty just varied way too much and I felt there wasn't a good pace set. This was mainly due to that fact that Mojas can eat a piece of you and there's no way to shake them off. If you bump them in time you can get the piece back, but when several surround you it gets frustrating.All the collecting and stuff is fine, but it is difficult to tell where these hidden spaces are. You have to accidentally come across them because there is no hint that they are there. No wall discoloring, no breaks, nothing. I honestly felt nothing in this game was worth while or worth finding. Once you finish a level you never want to go back because you will eventually just tire of the game. The most enjoyable moments in LR2 are when you aren't even controlling the game. When you go on ""gumball"" style rides where you break down into tiny blobs and go for a ride, those were enjoyable to just watch. It reminded me of gumball machines as a kid, especially the crazy ones.LocoRoco 2 is full of charm, but older players may grow tired of it quickly. It's a one trick pony and is nearly identical to the first game in almost every way. Collecting items feels pointless, and they are very difficult to find in levels. The boss fights are annoying and hard due to the finicky jumping mechanics, but it is an overall enjoyable game.",3,LR2 is too similar to the first game,1356566400,"12 27, 2012"

This game was made by Rockstar before getting into the 3D Grand Theft Autos and other games. This game has a lot of potential, but is flawed in a lot of ways that make the game more boring and frustrating than bad. With that said, the only redeeming quality are the good-looking combat animations and challenge.Right out of the gate you will notice that the controls are completely upside and backwards. All the combat moves are on the shoulder buttons. Why in the world they thought of this is beyond me. You actually don't really use the face buttons all that much. This make jumping, fighting, and shooting clumsy and cumbersome and you can't change the controls to something more natural. These are just some of the worst action/adventure controls I have ever used. The actual combat is fine, but executing these moves is a pain. I felt like I was stumbling over myself because I had to think about the controls. These just aren't natural! Jumping with R1, L2 and L1 are kick and punch, and you pick up items with R3. What?! I felt like I was trying to solve a Rubix cube, not play a game.Secondly is the exploration factor. The levels are boring. They all look pretty much the same with flat boring textures and the design is confusing and labyrinthine in some levels. There's no direction and your compass is useless. The bar gets smaller as you get near an objective, but if you are two flights down it will act like you're standing right next to it. Enemies are stupid and clumsy, boss fights are frustrating, and the game just can't compensate its own design with the clumsy controls. I can't tell you how tired I got after just three levels of finding this colored console to open same colored door over and over again.The story isn't really worth sticking around the 14 levels either. The anime cut scenes are nice, but you probably won't even get through this slog of a game. I tried really hard to keep going, but there was never a change in pace. It didn't help that there is no mid-level saving and the checkpoint placement is unfair. If you quit in the middle of a level you have to start all over. There are just a lot of annoying things with this game, but even if it was flawless you still have the fact that the game is just boring and not very fun.When it is all said and done only the hardest core of anime fans will stick around until the end. You really had to have played this when it first came out, then come back for nostalgic purposes. The game is just clumsy and boring, but has so much potential if only the developers spent more time on the game. As is stand, I really can't recommend this to anyone.",2,Oni suffers from boring level design and cumbersome controls,1347494400,"09 13, 2012"

10845,175148,ARY1F43B21KAN,B004NRN5EO,Sir Spirituous,"[34, 49]","Dark Souls: The spiritual successor to 2009's excellent Playstation 3 exclusive Demon's Souls is a broken mess of a  game, and is full of bugs, exploits, and a whole host of other issues.These constant issues really take away from the enjoyment of this title, as they are present throughout the entire game, and your constantly fighting these issues. There is no excuse to have so many issues in the game. Especially when you consider how well made Demon's Souls was.The only positive things From Software have brought over from Demon's Souls, To Dark Souls is:A. Memorable Boss FightsB. Excellent Music (when there is music playing)And the only new feature that is present in Dark Souls that works properly isA. Offline Invasions. Where a CPU controlled NPC will attack your game world, and it looks like another player is attacking you.Everything else, they really dropped the ball on.So with that said, let's get right into the issues with this game.In no particular order:1. The Control Input LagDark Souls hates you. It hates you so bad, that when you press a button it will sometimes just not register that you pressed the button/direction and will tell you to piss off. This makes you die, A LOT. The fact that your constantly dealing with this throughout the game is insane. This is not only in certain areas of the game, this issue is a constant.  This issue alone is enough to make most people stop playing the game right away.2. Graphic Lag And SlowdownAgain like the Control Input Lag, this issue effects the entire game. There are times when your game will literally come to a crawl and you'll barely be able to move around due to the Graphic Lag. Your FPS (Frames Per Second) will drop into the single digits and everything will move in super slow motion.This would be a cool effect, if it was actually an effect and not the game grinding to a halt due to poor programming. You'll scream at your TV when it happens, because you'll be fighting something intensely and then BAM, slowdown and guess what? Your dead.3. TargetingThe Targeting system is completely broken in this game. You'll try to target a different enemy, only to have the targeting system refuse to target another enemy. You then have to try and break the targeting manually, and most times this makes things even worse and again causes you to die needlessly. This is confusing as 2009's Demon's Souls had this system down perfectly.4. The CameraThe Camera angles will sometimes just up and decide to auto adjust through no input from you at all. You'll be walking carefully around a ledge and have the camera behind your character and the next second the camera loses it's mind and positions itself in the worse possible viewpoint. Almost as if on purpose to make you die more. It is frustrating beyond belief to say the least.5. Severe Weapons/Magic ImbalanceA. Weapons that scale to your stats are much, much, weaker then Lightning/Fire weapons.B. Lightning/Fire weapons are severely overpowered.C. Certain magic spells are severely overpowered.6. Game Breaking ExploitsPlayers found a way to duplicate an unlimited number of souls via an exploit.Players of Japan had the game a month before other parts of the world and a week after the game was released someonefigured out how to gain an infinite number of souls via this exploit.This in turn had people power level to extreme levels and all but ruined fair PVP (player vs player) matches and game balance.A1. You had people level 100+, 200+, 300+, 400+ raiding people who where low level.A2. People used this exploit to throw thousand of thrown items in PVP matches, doing hundreds of thousand of damage per second to other players.B. Players found a way to duplicate as many shards/chunks/slabs of ore material they need. Thereby being able to max out multiple  armor set and weapons in a much shorter time than intended. Again completely unbalancing the game.C. Players found a way to duplicate items via vendors. Thereby giving them unlimited items. Again completely unbalancing the game.There are a host of other exploits going on right now, but the ones listed above are the most prevalent.Needless to say, this utterly ruins any semblance of a fair fight in this game if your playing online.The only way to avoid these issues is to play the game in offline mode, sad to say.And speaking of online mode..7. Online Multi-player/Matchmaking is brokenDark Souls Online Aspect is not only a broken mechanic, it is possibly one of the worst, if not THE WORST matchmaking system I have ever seen in my life. It uses some form of P2P (Peer To Peer) matchmaking system and it is totally random as to who you get matched up with when you play online.You get the messages of ""Failed To Summon"" constantly in Dark Souls and it is beyond frustrating to say the least.Some areas you won't even find people to summon to help you out (Lost Izalith I'm looking at you) as most people seem to place there summoning signs before boss areas or at the very start of certain areas.You can traverse the game for hours before running into a summoning sign, and even then it's 50/50 if your even going to be able to summon them to help you out. Most of the time you'll see the ever familiar and frustrating ""Failed To Summon"" message.Here are a few examples of just how bad the multiplayer aspect is.A. I tried using an item that let's you invade other people's games to fight them. I had 10 uses on the item and tried 10 times in a row to invade someone's gaming world, and all 10 times failed with the ""Failed to invade"" message.B. I tried to use another item (unlimited use) which lets you invade players who have sinned in the world, and failed to invade each and every time I tried to use it in multiple areas of the game. (I tried over 30 times to use this item without success)C. I literally spent over 20minutes trying to summon my friend in game, as did he, all without success once. We where both around the same level  minus one or two levels) and tried over and over again to join each others game to help out without success.D. A very large percentage of the people that invade your game are exploiters who are 100-200-300 levels higher then you and kill you in one hit, use the exploit I mentioned above to rain thrown weapons down on you from across the map, and use every exploits in the game to cheat to win in fights.8. No Directions At AllDemon's Souls at least had some direction of what your purpose was. There was some layout and structure of where to go and what to do. Not so in Dark Souls.  Your told to ""Ring Two Bells"" and that's it.Even the directions given to you by the NPC at the start of the game is not clear. Nor are you told what general direction you need to go.You literally have to figure out where your supposed to go and where your not supposed to go from the get go.Without looking at a Wiki page, gamefaqs, or using the strategy guide, you literally will have no idea which way to go.Your never told, ""Hey don't go fight those skeletons until later in the game, because you need a special type of weapon you can only make later in the game"". Nope, your given absolutely no information whatsoever.At least in Demon's Souls you had the Archstone system. And it clearly said world 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, etc. You could instantly see, ok I'm supposed to start at world 1-1 then, and proceed.Dark Souls literally just dumps you on the ground in the middle of nowhere and says to you, ""Screw You"".9. Critical Information And Poor Translation WorkImagine this scenario. Your working your way through a level and find yourself an Item. You read the description and it tells you ""Use this item to Strengthen your Estus Flasks. (Health Drinks) So you proceed to use the item, yet see no change to your Estus Flasks.You wonder to yourself, ""Hmm did I read the information wrong, or did I mess this up somehow?Only to later find out in the game, your not supposed to use the item, but your instead supposed to give that item to an NPC to get the bonus to your Estus Flasks. Oh and did we mention this special NPC is just down the stairs in a jail cell against a wall that is very easy to run by without noticing? No? Oh well to bad for you!Not only do you have to deal with a poor translation job, which is bad enough but then you have to deal with the fact that critical information like this is just not given to you in any way, shape or form in this game.Your almost required to constantly check the Wiki pages, gamefaq pages, or strategy guide to make sure you don't screw your game and character up. This is not enjoyable in the least, and adds even more frustration to an already hair pulling experience.Demon's Souls information was there right in front of you. Critical NPC'S where not hidden from you, and translation and voice over work actually told you important information, not this train wreck that is Dark Souls.10. Storyline Is Non-ExistentYou literally have no idea what the hell is going on. All you know is that your undead, you have to ring bells to proceed, and that's about it. Your not given any back story as to why your undead, who the hell all those other undead NPC'S are, why your supposed to kill these bosses, and what your mission is even supposed to be.You actually knew what your goal was in Demon's Souls. You had a purpose and it was laid out clearly for you. In Dark Souls youhave no sense of direction, no information is given to you, and what little you do have you have to decipher like your in World War II intercepting encrypted enemy transmissions11. Running Around The World, And Running, And Running, And Running.Hey you! Do you enjoy running non-stop for 10minutes straight from point A to point B in video games? Is that not the most awesome thing ever? No? It actually sucks and is boring as hell?  Yup, it sure as hell is.And that's exactly what your going to be doing in this game most of the time. Running endlessly from point A to point B, because you have no other way to get there, but to run, run, and run some more.You don't even get the ability to transport between areas until much later in the game. Which is insane, since you could do this in Demon's Souls right away via the Archstones.Whoever thought that running between these large areas for 10minutes straight needs to be shot, and shot bad.This person is probably also the same person who thought allowing players to transport to any Bonfire (Dark Souls version of Demon's Souls Archstones) they've been to previously was just to ""easy"", so let's make it a fixed amount of ones you can actually go to. And hell let's make one of them (Gravelords) totally pointless as you can't even leave that area if you zap to it.In ClosingWhile Dark Souls is enjoyable if your willing to deal with the issues above, it's a lot to ask for from the player. (new and vet alike) Add to that all the rampant exploiting going on, and the hollow feeling you get at the end of the game (pun intended) and it's just to much.It's hard to believe that the same company who made the excellent Demon's Souls is behind this product as well. It's clear this game was released to early and still needed some major testing to be done on it, instead of releasing it in this state.There is no way I can recommend this game to anyone in it's current form. Perhaps once From Software patches the game, and addresses the many issues with the title (hopefully) it will be a better product.But in it's current form, I can only recommend people rent the title first.  If your looking for a superior title to pick up, without any of the issues of this title, then I would suggest the original Demon's Souls.",3,Dark Souls: Prepare For A Mess,1319414400,"10 24, 2011"

This is not the type of system any concious gamer would ever want to use for the purpose of gaming.  Apparently someone never told sony that games can frustrate people, especially games that mercilously exploit the concept that at times there is nothing the gamer can do but sit and watch everything he worked for turn to *dung* right in front of him.  You can imagine my horror when I started playing games on this $250 dollar portable machine.  The games are unknowingly placed into a system that cranks and groans with each agonizing attempt to retrieve the stupid amount of code sony expects a system of this calibur to produce.Imagine working for fort knox, and having them tell you that by hand they are expecting you to move every brick of gold to a facitlity just two feet away.  Imagine this system cranking, and groaning, and crying out for the sweet release of death as it attempts to load these obscenely detailed games.Holding this little system in front of you, trying to negotiate with games that had their immense amount of options crammed into the use of six stupid buttons, losing touch with the initial admiration of it's apparent abilities when you realize that this thing is just not fun to play, you realize that sony has a some sort of grudge against gamers.Buy this system so you can pay almost $200 for a 2 gig memory stick, and copy movies on to it you would have probably been alright being able to view on your computer at home anyway.  As a media player, it's alright.The games and movies are little discs, trapped within bulky cases to keep them from getting scratched.  The downside to this is you can't just put ten of these things into a compact flipbook.  You can only therefore bring about two discs with you wherever you go, or defeat the purpose of having something compact in the first place.If you want a great portable gaming experience, buy the Nintendo DS, Nintendo realized that loading times sucked a long time ago, the games for the DS are more often designed with fun in mind instead of great graphics that take an amount of time to load that makes you forget ever wanting to admire the game in the first place, Nintendo's games ARE COMPACT.If you want a great portable media player, there are much better alternatives out there.  Portable Media players with HARD DRIVES that amount to 200 GIG.  Portable Media players with that kind of hard drive capacity, and are around $400 bucks.  When you compare that to how many memory sticks you'd have to buy to amount to the hard drive space, you do the math.Initially I can understand why people admire this little system, and how it's graphics are just better than other portable systems.  The ideas surrounding buying one however should be fun with the games, and a good reason to invest in media designed just for it.The games?  Any kind of fun one may have playing the games is sucked away by the obscene loading times and constant grinding of the system as it attempts to compensate for the speed of the average gamer.  I have not played a single game on the psp that didn't have obscene loading times, and that didn't make me want to trash the $250 piece of *dung*.The media?  The movies are smaller, yet less compact than dvds twice their size.  The movies never have as many options due to the tiny disc of information trapped in the bulky prison of hard plastic.  Any type of movies you may download must be played on a memory stick that at it's cheapest is around $40.00 for a 32 megabyte stick.  What are you going to watch that's only 32 megabytes?This system is going to go down when people realize that a portable dvd player, a Nintendo ds, and an Ipod are much less frustrating alternatives to this little piece of *dung* system that tries too hard to fit in.",2,"For the love of God, a system that wishes it was dead",1136937600,"01 11, 2006"

If all you care about is graphics, this is not the game for you. You would expect this game to be on the ps1 or even the Sega Saturn, but not the most powerful next gen system. The battle areas are bland, with no detail past the muddy looking ground and poorly animated trees. There are glitches everywhere in the game such as water going through trees and when your Mech tries to cross a bridge and falls in, the water just sits there.

I would also compare it to Sims3 -- a game I suggest EA rename ""LOADING"" because that's most of what the game did (on the console version). I never played the most recent SimCity offering which earned EA the trophy for the most hated company in America. I'm sure I'd liken Defiance to that, if I'd played it.So anyway, we are stuck in some kind of bad patch/install loop or something. I realize I got this thing in the bargain bin for $7.99 or whatever-it-was and that the TV show looks like really bad cheesy sci-fi (of Babylon 5 ilk) -- I say this as a sci-fi fan...but I can't fathom why after a year, the patch process hasn't been figured out, bad patches removed, or whatever is necessary to play this piece of garbage. The game is currently telling me (after what seemed like 10 patches, 2 or 3 hours later) that an install of 3716 MB is required to play. It already said that 2 hours ago and I have far more than that left on the hard drive. There's another 1 star review on here that also talked about the patch process but couldn't answer how to actually install the patches properly to play the stupid thing (apparently its luck of the draw). Should I really have to scour the internet to figure out how to play a console game? This is what PC gamers generally have to put up with and console gamers do not...I do hold the game in very high regard for giving me some big lulz, including one part of the patch/install process in which the game said 480-something days left on its install time. Upon seeing that I started laughing hysterically and yelling to my girlfriend ""quick, get the camera and take a picture of that!!"" By the time she got the camera, the game was down to a modest 475 days left to install!!! HOORAY!!!! I joked that I would leave the game to my next of kin, and hopefully they or their children's children would be able to play it someday...heh.Also, the patch process apparently takes so long that the Xbox controller falls asleep and that pauses the download of the patch for some bizarre reason (why does the controller have to even be on for this? - who knows)...You might have to rubber band the thumbsticks to keep it awake. They should release an additional patch to the game to keep it awake so you can go watch a movie or something while it pointlessly does what ever it is doing, ad infinitum, ad nauseum, while running your controller battery down to oblivion...Maybe the Trion servers are disconnected and I'm unaware and they didn't patch it with a patch superseding other patches to tell people.

Some levels don't really mess well with the game. I don't want to spoil the game but it is usually levels that are linear in nature (You will know them when you play through them). There a few game mechanics that cause problems with the game.The fighting mechanic is abysmal. It is basically a quick time event that tests your reflexes (Good luck beating it in purist mode). Another mechanic flaw is the uniform mechanic. This mechanic means that people who wear the same uniform will see through your disguise. This sounds like a good idea and it is but it is unrealistic. Every cop in Chicago doesn't know every single cop in Chicago.The worst flaw is the checkpoint system which saves current progress in the level. The biggest problem with this system is that enemies that are subdued are not saved. If you restart a level via a checkpoint, the enemies respawn. It may not seem like a big deal but it actually is for a game that requires stealth and patience.Contracts mode, on the other hand is what single player game should have been. It uses the levels in the game and allows you to select a &#34;hit&#34; to perform on someone.It is a shame, I really wanted to like this game but the game mechanics really make it a miss for me.

1889,192018,ABWH7ZIOZLWO0,B005EYRAUK,"rodjoh ""rodjoh""","[0, 0]","On the HD consoles, Sonic Generations is a 3D platformer that follows ""Classic Sonic"" and ""Modern Sonic"" through stages all across the history of Sonic games. The big gameplay feature of this game is that you get to experience, for instance, the same old Green Hill Zone in a 2D (but with HD graphics) perspective as before, but then in Act 2 you get to see things in a 3D perspective... which is really a whole new stage but with that look and feel of the classic. And then the contrary happens with the stages based on 3D Sonic games. It is actually a great game with its own merits.Now back to the 3DS version. They could have very well ported it with dumbed down graphics or something, but instead they opted to do a 2D focused game with its exclusive set of stages. That means that most of the stages you will play on this version are not on the main version. This is pretty cool and since the gameplay is 2D focused, it feels more attached to the expected classic Sonic gameplay than the HD game. In this case, modern Sonic still plays in 2D but has a different set of moves and it is more focused on Speed runs than platform jumping.Another thing that I like about this game is that it features things like Special stages (where you get the emeralds) and it has a Casino themed level from Sonic 2. These are iconic Sonic elements that are not present in the HD game.This game also features Online versus play and side missions if you feel like doing that after you are done with the main game.If there are a few things I didn't like are the following: 2D Sonic for some reason doesn't feel as ""fluid and thight"" as the classic Genesis games. There is a long discussion on the quality of more recent Sonic games and it seems like Sega is slowly working to improve that, but until then I feel that they are ""almost there, but still not quiet"". The best example of this is playing Green Hill Zone on the original Sonic and then playing the new Green Hill Zone of Generations. It definitely doesn't feel the same, for whatever reason.There's a misconception that Sonic should just keep running forever and non-stop, and Sega has been making modern Sonic games based on that idea. The problem is that when you need to stop and do some platform jumping or something that requires precision, control issues will betray you over and over. This is more true on the HD outing but Modern Sonic suffers some of that here as well. Sonic games have reached a point where they feel like they rely more on quick-time event mashing than actual platformer skills. Anyway hopefully Sega will find a way to fix this. Eventually. Someday.Sonic Generations is a nice 2D platformer. Sonic fans will love it, and if you can play the HD version as well, even better.If you don't know much about Sonic, it is still a great game to play. I don't know if it is a must have though, it probably isn't. But if you get it you will enjoy it for what it is.",4,It's like the lost chapter of the main Sonic Generations.

But the gamecube's controller was always an awkward piece of equipment when I held it.  The triggers always seemed too big and way too deep, the ""c"" analog stick seemed out of place and not well though out in terms of accuracy. The ""Z"" button's ridiculously small size and overwhelmingly poor layout made it impossible to hit on the fly, and made me decide to never play gamecube.  But as soon as I saw this item, I knew I had to give it a try.(See update after reading)Let me tell you, it doesn't disappoint.  Everything is smooth as can be for most games. X takes the place of the A button, square is the B button, and Triangle and Circle are X and Y, L2 and R2 are the L and R shoulder buttons, and L1 and L2 are the Z button.  So far I've played Super Mario Sunshine and Metroid Prime 2 and the only flaw I've noticed is the pressure sensitivity in the shoulder buttons, as other people have said as well.But it's not always the same case with every game.  I noticed that when playing Metroid, I had to press really hard on the R2 button to make it register in the game.  But when I played Super Mario Sunshine, the slightest amount of pressure on the R2 button made the game think that I was holding it down as hard as I could.  It may prove to be a hassle while playing certain games, but so far it hasn't stopped me from opening the door to a new world of gaming.  I have yet to try it on the wii so I can't tell you anything about that.  But the face buttons work perfectly so DDR compatibility should be top notch.But overall, I'd say this is actually a pretty solid investment if you prefer the PS2 controller over the gamecube controller in terms of layout and comfortability.  Granted the functionality isn't equal to that of the actual gamecube controller, but I'm fairly certain that after 5 minutes of playing, you'll completely forget that you're using an adapter.**Update**If you're fortunate enough to own a Logitech wireless PS2 controller, it actually works 100% perfect.  Logitech seemed to have the shoulder button sensitivity in mind when they made the controller.  If you don't have one, I say get one even if it's just for your PS2.

Atari's newest heroine is very cute, but she doesn't have what it takes to beat down her real enemy-a market supersaturated with other platformers. The first indication of Kya's mediocrity is the slapped-together plot. The story revolves around Kya, who is sucked into a ""mysterious world"" along with her half-brother, Frank. When Frank is captured by Brazul (the evil ruler of the land), Kya suddenly becomes a master of weaponry, including her fists and her boomerang hairpin. Surprisingly, the depth of the combat in this game is one of its best assets, whether you delight in mashing the buttons indiscriminately or patiently practicing long strings of complicated combos. Kya's combat system offers a large library of fighting moves and adds new ones as Kya progresses through the game. Unfortunately, Kya is a very difficult game to play as the controls are not particularly intuitive and the camera seems to delight in going haywire during delicate jumping situations. In addition, there are several frustrating points in the game where Kya must flawlessly complete large sections or else face having to do them all over again. This is great for fans of tedium and frustration, but with so many other contenders to the throne, Kya's attractive graphics and plucky heroine are not really enough to place it on top of the platform pile.",3,Life's too short for games like this,1074297600,"01 17, 2004"

The game takes place over a ten year in game time frame and has very little gamewise to do with Origins. Several familiar names from the first game appear as well as from Awakings, but with the number of fantastic characters from Origins I would have expected them to pick some of the more popular NPCs.I enjoyed the game and the story as well as the NPC companions, but not as much as I did in Origins. There were a good number of interesting quests and some of the companion specific quests I really enjoyed. But after a 20 hour play through I have no real interest in going back and playing through it again. The story seems more linear and your effect on the game world as the main character just don't seem as weighty and important as Origins. I also missed the great camp setting in the first game, in DA2 you are required to run all over town to talk with your companions. Some of the NPC/Companion interaction while in the party I found very fun and interesting. I even found myself laughing at the interactions between Isabella and Aveline. But when compared to the first Dragon Age and other fantastic Bioware games like Mass Effect I think they could have done even better. It is well worth the investment but keep your expectations in check.",4,Still one of the best western RPGs on Consoles.,1307923200,"06 13, 2011"

You set out to do something only to run into something else that looks interesting, and you think, ""I'll just see where this goes for a minute and then come right back,"" and five or six iterations later, you're on the other side of the continent with an incomplete recollection of the chain of events that brought you there. There's a lot of stuff to do, a lot of goodies to find, and a lot of creatures to kill. If you're a completionist, this game will keep you busy for quite a long time. I finished it in just under 70 hours.Many of the game's mechanics will no doubt feel familiar, which is by no means a bad thing since they're implemented very well. The items you'll find in the game -- and there's a ridiculous variety of them -- follow the same sort of schema as in Diablo II. When you find something you don't need, you can either sell it or break it down into components which (with the requisite skills) you can recombine them into custom equipment. There are dozens of different reagents you can find which can be mixed in a vast number of ways to produce all kinds of potions. There are loads of skills and abilities to choose from as you develop your character, and if you don't like what you've done, you can reallocate those points and come up with a completely different character build, which is a nice option to have. Combat is handled nicely, with enough variety to keep it interesting even through the game's (potentially) very long play time.The bad: The story is utterly forgettable, odd in a game which advertises the writer as a selling point. I've never read anything by Salvatore, so I can't speculate on whether fans of his will agree with me here or burn me as a heretic, but to me it's really missing the narrative strength and interesting characters that you'll find in, for example, some of Bioware's RPGs like Dragon Age or Baldur's Gate.If you take the time to complete all the side quests and such, then by the time you reach the later stages of the game, the difficulty will have fallen off dramatically, even on Hard. The big showdown at the end of the game is a cakewalk, and the ending seems almost like an afterthought.

I played it so much that my dad broke the CD along with Warcraft 2 telling me that I can't play any games from now on. So I recently bought Starcraft Battle Chest Secretly (my dad doesn't know that I have this game) again. This game is so good because the system requirements are so low that I can turn off the game without turning off the whole computer. My dad leaves on the PC the whole time so I have to leave it on all the time. If I turn off the whole computer, he might suspect that I have been playing a computer game. I always play when he goes to some place until I hear a keychain or a footstep. I probably disconnect off the game more than any other players on the planet.

The requirements are no problem unless you haven't bought a new computer since 1998. The gameplay is great and the graphics and sounds are good. The best part of all is the Battle.net.

7659,151701,AEMIDH4S3DEV8,B003ALEWKU,"Paul Laudun ""Mr. Ludda's reviews""","[4, 8]","First thing that I have to say is that I haven't played this game on the PS3 (I am in the military and in Iraq), but if this game is simular in any way to the PS3 version, I will not devy up the $60 for it.The second thing is that this game is a dissapointment to me. I knew about this game coming out about a year ago, and I expected LBP-level type awesomeness with this game. Too bad that when I opened it up, I was let down.1) The controls-Let me say that the controls aren't that bad...But they aren't that good either. Sliding/Drifting is the main problem here, as it's hit-or-miss, either the game allows you to make the drift, it point and shoots you directly into the inside wall, or it points and shoots you to the outside wall, there is no inbetween. I know a couple of times I even had the line right, but I still ended up hitting the inside wall, and for a game that is so heavily reliant on drifting for boost/sheild, this is unacceptable. Sometimes the conter-steering does work, but mostly it doesn't. Another issue is when you try to perfom sideswipes/stomps, and nothing happens, again, it's a hit-or-miss thing, but it shouldn't be this way.I know that Modnation Racers were trying to be a mix between LBP and Mario Kart, but with somewhat decent controls, it falls a little flat.2) Creativity-I sorta hate games like this, where they tell you that you have such a high level of creativity, but then they handicap you by not giving you at least enough to get you hooked. This is the issue with this game, the amount of things that are open in the begining of the game is so small that it almost kills all of the fun for me that I have to be forced through a painfully difficult season mode.The track creation mode, while competent, isn't at all like I was hoping for. I was hoping that they would ditch the moving kart creation and go for a more Trackmania-style creator. Too bad that this wasn't the case, as the track creator was VERY confusing to get started. And when the only straight line you could make is the finish-start area, you have issues. Again, it is not all bad, but it isn't all good either.3) Career Mode-I know I might have read this before, but the career mode is PAINFULLY difficult. There are a couple of things that I've noticed with this mode that kills the fun even more.The first thing is that this game is a ""rubberband racer"", and before I begin, let me tell you that I HATE rubberband racers.Like I've stated before, this game is trying to be a cross between Mario Kart and LBP, but Mario Kart wasn't even really a rubberband racer to begin with, at least in that game, if you are beating your opponents by a large margin, you will win your races by a large margin.In this game, and I have been privy to this, you could be smoking your opponents, but no later than 2-3 seconds later, not just the 2nd place oppent is right on your tail, but ALL of your opponents are on your tail. I have avoided Midnight Club 4 becase of stuff like this, and it makes me avoid this game for the exactly same reason.The second issue with this game is the difficulty of this game in career mode. You see, in normal racing games, the difficulty increases in a gradual manner. It usually starts off in easy, then as you get to the end, it becomes harder. But not in this game. No, instead of doing this it goes from easy in the first series of races to hard right as you get to the 1st race of the 2nd series of races!If your opinion of a good racer is a Grid-like, wanting to throw your PSP/controller against a wall, cheapness, then congradulations, this game is for you! As it seems that in the 2nd series, you have opponents who has unlimited nitro, or unlimited ammo, or you will loose control of your kart easily.And, with the fact that this game requires you to gain items from your races, it makes for a HUGE buzzkill.Finally, there is a lack of a tutorial mode in this game (and the funny thing is that the manual said that there is one), which means that this game was rushed. So, if you see any thing that the game asks you to do, and you don't know how to do it, you are stuck (as it doesn't even explain things in the manual). Again, all of this hurts the game to me.4) Speed-Finally, the last issue that I have with this game is the fact that I do not feel ANY sense of speed. If they are going for a Mario Kart vibe, they have failed in this aspect; at least in the Mario Kart games, the action is fast and furious. You get the sensation of speed, and it becomes even more evidient as you get a boost perc. In this game, you are painfully puttering around a long course, and the boosts you get only shoots you for a second, then you are again painfully puttering around a long course.It gets tiring, and boring, as you do this, and this is another issue with the game.Again, I don't find this game TOTALLY a buzzkill, but I find that this game isn't totally that great either. So, I am giving this game ***. It's decent, but it is also a dissapointment in many ways.",3,A Decent Dissapointment,1276905600,"06 19, 2010"

It is highly insulting that a company that has made the highest profit margins of this generation of consoles has chosen to release a downgraded system (at a higher price then the legitimate sku can be bought at any time at Target/Walmart) that not only drops backwards compatible play with Gamecube titles from last generation, which includes some of the best software that has been availible on the Wii mind you, but they also have dropped support for Gamecube controllers and Wavebird GCN controllers in the Wii games that support them.These aren't just average titles that are being messed with or just a handful of them either. Games like Mario Kart (a pack-in title on their good sku with well over 20 million copies sold) that many many people prefer to play using the excellent gamecube controller over the Wii Wheel option or simply the wiimote. Then you have a second absolute marquee release in Super Smash Brothers Brawl which once again a great deal of people (from my expirence the vast majority of them) also not only prefer playing with the gamecube controller but outright dislike the game on the wiimote.Then lets not forget one of the best features of the Wii console being the Virtual Console allowing people to download games from NES, SNES, Genesis, N64, Master System, Turbo Graphics x16, etc which were all playable on the very comfortable and versitile gamecube controller with in my opinion the N64 games being much better on the gamecube controller then they are on the classic controller.I can't really fathom the point of why Nintendo has done this to save/rob, really a couple of dollars and they couldn't even add anything to make up for it like say an HDMI port, a built-in wired ethernet solution, a simple optical output for digital sound, add DVD playback or at the very least update the built-in wifi which is still using an extremely outdated and cheap technology from nearly a decade ago.I personally think Nintendo has been price gouging the entire generation, I think at its launch for $249 that they easily could've hit a sub $200 price and that they could've been at a sub $99 price for awhile now. I still own and love my Wii, Nintendo is still one of if not the best game developers in the business and they continue to get my money because of those games but they do by far the worst job in the entire console industry of providing value on the hardware side.I will continue to spend my money on their products for years to come as they have software that makes putting up with their over-priced and underpowered hardware. That being said, this is absolutely not the Wii that I would recommend anyone to buy. If you want a Wii pick up one of the older models with either Mario Kart or if you can find one the Wii Sports/Resort bundle is also a better way to go.It really is just sad that Nintendo's software development teams which are truly amoung the best in the industry if not the best in the industry are a part of the same company. It was already a bad deal in terms of what we were getting for our dollars in terms of technology for $150 from Nintendo vs what $200 or $250 get you from Microsoft or Sony.I find this type of move even more distressing when you factor in that Nintendo has basically just about stopped supporting the system with new software with very little having actually been released on the system over the 2011 year and with just a few meaningful games still to come such as Zelda and Mario Party 9.",1,Wii without all the features that a Wii has always enjoyed.,1319846400,"10 29, 2011"

Either you've seen the movies, played the games or seen one of the umpteen million clones.  The one thing the game does do (with its tradmark humor) is it does explore some of the battles that are hinted at in the movie but never explored. Speaking of the humor in the game, the story is moved forward in silent (no talking) cut scenes that act out what happened in the story, usually with the characters doing something silly (where in the movie it was of course done seriously, proably with a annoying cg character and a lot of explosions)in a mini scene that summarizes what happened before and after the level. This paticular version combines the two previous seperate releases so you get the original movies and the prequel thingies, which means there is plenty material to explore and plenty of secrets to find. So take a look at this not just for kids take on the Star Wars universe and you may find yourself pleasantly suprised and maybe a little addicted.-------Game Play: Basic on the surface, run through the level bash anything that moves, but deep when the player starts trying to collect studs to fill the power meter, the power blocks and various other secrets that require the player to go back to the level and play through again with characters unlocked in later chapters.

It may just be my TV but when there is a lot of action on the screen I can see the refresh line as the game / xbox tries to keep up.Controls / Camera: The controls for this game are simple. One button attacks, one button jumps, one button uses whatever special ability a character uses. For the most part the characters do what the player tells them and rarely decides to jump into that pit of lava in front of him. I only had a problem with this in the level (return of the sith, pt 6) based around lava and you have to run and jump with the camera facing toward the characters so it's hard to see what is coming up.

It is hauntingly beautiful yet filled with enough action to keep you interested.The game is the latest installment in the ""Panzer Dragoon"" saga, which was about the only decent thing on the Sega Saturn. You basically fly around on a dragon, killing enemies and fighting huge boss battles. In this game, your dragon can assume three different forms, and you can switch between them at will. Each form has its own strengths and weaknesses, meaning you actually have to employ some strategy to get through most of the levels.The gameplay is very strong. This is a rail shooter, so you move along a path for the whole level, like ""Star Fox"" The controls are also simple to understand. You hit one button to shift between forms, another to use your special ""berserk"" attacks, another to dash and brake, and another to shoot your gun or use your homing lasers. You also can easily move the camera around with a tap of the L or R buttons to face enemies faster. The enemies are widely varies and provide enough of a challenge to engage, but not frustrate, the average gamer. The boss battles are really things of beauty. You have to find the weak point of each boss by flying around using your dash abilities while dodging attacks. In later stages, this requires a lot of work, as the weak point shifts and you have to use different forms to beat a boss.Graphically, ""Orta"" is as good as it gets. Each level is like a piece of art and each individual enemy is extensively detailed. The bosses are simply huge and well-designed, providing enough eye candy to almost make you forget that you're about to be fried by a huge energy beam. Soundwise, ""Orta"" is a little disappointing. The music sounds very much like the music in the original ""Panzer Dragoon"". Even some of the sound effects remain unchanged.Speaking of the original game, it's include on here, along with five short bonus missions and a sub-scenario about a boy who's father was killed by the dragon. They're fun to play, as you get to pilot different vehicles and go through new storylines.The main reason I didn't give this game five stars was because it is much, much too short. I appreciate all the extras, like the encyclopedia and still art, but a lot of that memory could have been used to add more gameplay. I beat this game in less than a week, and I wasn't even playing as much as I usually do. If Sega comes out with a second game for the Xbox, it needs to have at least twenty levels. You also come away from this game at the end feeling a little unsatisfied at the ending.Overall, this is an outstanding game that deserves to be a part of your library just so you can say you have it.

Perhaps it was a bit too favorable to two of the civs (ahem Teutons and Franks), but the campaigns were still a blast.  The Conquerors isn't so much an expansion pack as a complete overhaul of the game.  The civs have been radically balanced (especially with the patch, available on Ensemble's website), 5 (!) new civs have been added, and a ridculous amount of new random maps are now available.  I also suspect that the enemy AI has been greatly honed, but I can't really prove it-- all I know is that they're still pretty darned tough on Moderate (for Random Maps-- Campaigns no longer have the same five level difficulty system).If you already have Age of Kings, this is definitely worth the investment.  Now that both have been bundled with the original Age of Empires, however, you might want to shell out the money for the deluxe pack (AoE is a much simpler game, but still worthwhile).

5916,95835,A6VI02LR3Z3BW,B000X9FV5M,David A. Porter,"[0, 1]","The original FarCry is still one of my favourite shooters of all time. FarCry2 whilst having a  similar title, is however something of a departure from the original FarCry. The plot seems based on the book 'Heart of Darkness' by Joseph Conrad, whereby we see western characters bringing moral chaos into Africa (the games setting) through gun running and other activites. You are sent in to this setting with the mission of killing the Jackal - the chief gun runner and arms dealer causing this moral chaos. For those that have seen the idea portrayed in the film 'Apocalypse Now' you will get the idea. This plot is revealed through finding tapes that reveal the Jackals descent into moral darkness along the way in similar fashion to how the plot developed in Bioshock. Despite the same name as the original, FarCry2 is a whole different game, perhaps closest in concept to STALKER. FarCry2 is a giant sandbox whereby you get to do whatever it is that you please and tackle the game in any manner that you want, very similar in concept to how STALKER functioned. STALKER was a fantastic game and should be played by anyone interested in shooters and first person style RPGs. FarCry2 however fails to implement the elements needed in quite the same fashion as STALKER and the game quickly becomes boring and repetitive. There are almost no RPG elements that stalker has and so the tasks that FarCry2 asks you to accomplish become pointless and unimaginative. The world that is created is missing a few things, like civilians, and people living their lives, refugees and hence offers you no reason to feel at home in the enviroment, build a house, or setup a base (such as you might do in Oblivion and like). The world is populated by people that simply want to kill you, they will attack even if they have no chance of success and so in the course of the game your moral compass will shift from seeing if the person is a friendly to murdering people in their cars with flame throwers so they won't irritate you by running you off the road. In this sense the game actually succeeds in advancing the plot so you find the 'Heart of Darkness', but not because of the storytelling, but because everything in the game is so annoying that you just want it to die. As much as I wanted to like this game I found myself playing it to completion for the sake of liberating my hard drive space for something better - never a good sign. How come nobody can do a remake of the original FarCry but update the graphics and add a bunch of new levels or something. How good would that be. I am starting to think that the original was a fluke. The games magazines give this an impressive rating, meanwhile the gaming community has panned it - why do we still buy those magazines.Stability: Stable, for the most part other than the X-Fi problem. If you have an X-Fi and an nForce chipset then many have experiences snaps and crackling with the sound. I had this problem and could not resolve it. So if your system is suspect to this as mine is then FarCry2 is the worst affected that I have found. Other than sound I did not experience any crashes whilst playing in 50hrs of gameplay.Graphics: Inevitably this is going to be measured up against Crysis. Is FarCry2 as impressive as Crysis in the graphics department - nope, but I would argue that it is good enough nonetheless. It is similar is quality to Half-Life 2, but perhaps closest in look and feel to Soldier of Fortune Payback - for those who played that game. FarCry2 is slightly drabber that the brighter and more sprightly look is SOF Payback, but the feel is the same. I enjoyed the environment for the most part even if it got repetitive after awhile. Overall the feel and look of the environment is well done, though doesn't vary much like FarCry The Original did. The irony is that SOF Payback might be the better game.Sound: Apart from the X-Fi problem I mentioned the sound track fits quite well to the environment and doesn't ever feel annoying or out of place. However the sound affects are only better than average, though the atmospheric sounds do their job. There is also a sound positioning problem for those running 5.1 setups however the patch designed to fix this didn't work so well for me.Gameplay: This is the problem area. Whereas STALKER managed to mix the sandbox idea with an RPG system, with sound and NPCs really well as well as immersing you in a believeable environment, FarCry2 is really a let down in this department. The weapons never really improve, you cannot upgrade your car, you never develop any real friends in the game and the gameplay is a snoozefest. My wife was watching over my shoulder one night as I was playing and she said 'Isn't this boring?' Couldn't have said it better myself. FarCry worked because it kept the open ended part of the game only big enough to allow variety in how to get to an objective. STALKER worked because it allowed RPG elements that affected what you could do in the game and gave incentive for going out and exploring and becoming enveloped in the story. FarCry2 does neither of these things, it just gives a massive gameworld with nothing interesting to do it. No villages to save, no homes to make, no affecting the game in any real way, just tedious driving and console like diamond hunts. Doing console tasks on a PC is a drag, as is FarCry2. The game might have worked better if you went down a long river and got to upgrade your barge without having to go anywhere twice (Apocalyse Now anyone?) Too late to speculate now.Length: Took me about 50 hours (including wasting my time finding all of the diamonds - a  pointless task since you get more than enough money). This is a good standard by today's games, howeever one has to question whether is is 50 quality hours. I argue for the negative, Farcry2 has its moments but these only amount to about 3-4 hours worth.Replayability: I didn't bother with multiplayer as I have no friends who own the game, and  perhaps they are wise as they wish not too. If you find clipping your toenails to be exhilirating then this could be the game for you.Verdict: 2.5/5. In the end a mediocre effort, an impressive presentation but lacked fun. A far  cry from the original (pun intended).My current FPS Ranking (of alltime favourite shooters that I have played):1: FarCry (The Original and expansion packs and in particular the GearBox one)1: Crysis (including expansion packs)2.

You control a masked character in a top down view, and move him from room to room across various environments, brutally killing everyone you come across in order to reach an objective. Once you have what you are looking for, you walk back through the bloodbath you created to your car, stop by a convenience store for some quick groceries or a video store to rent a VHS tape, and then back home to sleep. You'll wake up the next morning, check your answering machine, get a mysterious message giving you orders, and then head out to the car to repeat it all again.Hotline Miami takes this premise and makes something that is utterly compelling, strangely beautiful, intriguing, and 100% enjoyable.

Hotline Miami goes places that mainstream games just don't go, and demonstrates why the indie movement has been so wonderful. It is a complex, mature game that isn't for everyone, but for older gamers who want to see how a small development team can use the essence of pure gameplay and mood to create something wholly original. When it comes to this, you really can't do any better than Hotline Miami.

Of course, that is what I was running through, but I was impressed at how they conveyed that through the sleek design of the city.

4985,45132,A3TGHK20ZKZFRP,B0001B15RA,Kazuo,"[8, 26]","Out of the 4 128-bit consoles (PS2, XBOX, GC, Dreamcast), the XBOX is by far the worst. I've disliked the console ever since it launched in November 2001, and since then, very little has happened to make me change my mind about it.The console reeks of soulless corporate greed. Some people may accuse Sony and their games of being soulless and corporate, but a soulless company could never make a game as beautiful and innovative as Ico, or something as charming & addictive as the first 3 Spyro the Dragon games. Microsoft seems to care about profit & appeal more than creativity and fun, and everything about the XBOX proves it.It also reeks of arrogance. When the XBOX was in development, it was codenamed ""Project Midway"", in reference to the World War II battle where the Americans outsmarted the Japanese. That's extremely ironic, because the idiots who almost ruined the game industry (Atari, 3D0) were American, and the ones who are credited with restoring it (Nintendo, Sega) were Japanese. And let's not forget those obnoxious ""ONLY ON XBOX"" stamps that all the exclusive games have on their boxes, as if they're mocking the other consoles because they don't have those games.Seamus Blackley, the man who designed the XBOX, thought he had the formula for a great gaming system because the console itself was powerful. When he was working on it, he didn't seem that concerned with making great games for it. The graphics over gameplay mentality that the console lives on is stupid and nonsensical. Most XBOX fanboys will brag about how powerful their console is. While it's true that the technical specs are better than the other 3 consoles, the only thing the XBOX has really used it's superior technical power for is for making better graphics, and as we all know, it's the gameplay, not the graphics, that make the game good. And what about the XBOXs games?The XBOX was sold almost entirely on the success of the launch title Halo, which is one of the most generic and overrated games ever made. Even Microsoft themselves admits that if it wasn't for Halo, the XBOX would've went the way of the Dreamcast. The PS2 had a somewhat weak launch, but by early 2002, it was absolutely spring-loaded with A+ game after  A+ game. So why can't XBOX do the same? Calling the console a one-trick pony is  pretty much accurate because almost all of the other early (first year) XBOX games like Azurik and Nighcaster were total garbage. Not to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but it almost makes you wonder if Microsoft payed the gaming magazines to hype up one of their games so the whole console would sell well.The XBOX has largely rejected Japanese support, so it makes sense that the console has largely flopped in the land of the Rising Sun. Some say that the Japanese are a bunch of selfish, overly-patriotic bastards. I say they know what's good for them. Before you call me a Japan ass-kisser, who revived the game industry from America's mistakes? Who created Pac-Man, Mario, Sonic, and many other of the best games (and game characters) ever? Who's not afraid to try new things or appear ""crazy"" because of it? Where are Yuji Naka and Hideo Kojima from? Trying to make a good console without Japan's help is like Britain trying to win World War II without America's help. It just isn't going to happen. Out of the few good exclusives that the XBOX has, ALL of them are from Japan. Gee, I wonder if it's some sort of coincedince?It's also an RPG-deprived wasteland. Most XBOX owners will tell you that the console has RPGs in the form of Fable, Star Wars: KOTOR, and Jade Empire, but these are actually just action games in disguise, with RPG elements in them. They're just not the same as Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior, nor are they anywhere NEAR as memorable.And where are the oddball and niche games? Niche games don't really sell well, but they usually turn out to be better than most highly anticipated titles. The PS2 has Mister Mosquito, Stretch Panic, and Katamari Damacy, the Gamecube has Cubivore and Pikmin, but what does the XBOX have for those of us who are looking for something ""different""? Nothing.XBOX has seemingly eclipsed the PS2 in terms of popularity, which seems fitting. 2 years ago, I would've grimaced at the thought of  the XBOX overthrowing the PS2 in that category, but now that I think about it, it reflects the quality of the consoles better. Most things that are popular just flat out suck. They get watered down for conformity and commercial success reasons. Garbage bands like Poison, Motley Crue, KoRn, Blink 182, 50 Cent, Ashlee Simpson and Fall Out Boy become popular and sell like crazy, while real artists like The Velvet Underground, Captain Beefheart, and My Bloody Valentine are doomed to toil in obscurity. In high school, the superficial preps take center stage at the proms and footballs games, while the nerds, goths and theatre kids are deemed ""weird"" by everyone else. Wal-Mart acts as a gigantic black hole toward smaller, more honest businesses, sucking them up, and not giving them a fighting chance. It works the exact same way with video games, so that should tell you which consoles have the real games.To it's credit, XBOX does have Shenmue II (the release of the US version on the Dreamcast was cancelled), Panzer Dragoon Orta, Ninja Gaiden, and Metal Slug 3 as exclusives, which are all great. Also, the ability to save your game without a memory card is an excellent idea. Because of these 2 factors, I've bumped the rating up a half a star.Gaming fans, save your money and get a PS2 or a Dreamcast instead. Or you could just wait for the next generation to arrive.

Remember how M. Bison in Street Fighter 2 or Heihachi in Tekken 1 were so incredibly cheap and would barely let you get a hit in?  If that sounds like fun, then by all means buy Def Jam Fight for NY!  This game is actually fun for a while, and it looks and sounds great, but it's too bad that the control is so cheesy and unbalanced that it basically ruined the game for me.PROS: Great graphics, awesome voice-over acting, tons of cool customization options (real licensed gear; you can get Air Jordans for your character!), an interesting story line, and tons of famous (and less famous) hip-hop celebrities.  This game has got style and character, without a doubt.CONS: Unfortunately, the gameplay (you know, the actual point of the game, as opposed to buying jewelry and clothes for your fighter like some urban Barbie doll) is both too simple and too frustrating.  The main problem is that all fights follow the same exact progression: land a punch or kick, get your opponent dizzy, grapple them, throw them down, pick them up while they're still dizzy, repeat.  There are NO MOVES in this game.  Oh sure, you can buy a couple dozen ""blazin' moves"", but these can only be used once or twice (rarely twice) a fight, and only in certain circumstances.  The BIG weakness is that the computer AI is really cheap, and will basically string together about 25 moves before you can even move.  Blocking and countering are really, really weak and tough to pull off, and I actually had a fight (admittedly with an upper level character) where I couldn't land a hit, and any miss on my part would result in a 3 minute orgy of hits from the AI.  HHMMMMM... fun.  I guess you could sum up the problem by saying that there is really little strategy involved, and that you can't get all that much better.  The crowd and object interaction are also really poorly done, since the crowd is like a magnet: get too close to ANY spectator, and they'll hold you while the computer unleashes a 13 hit combo.  Does this ever happen to the CPU?  Rarely. Lastly, the arenas are well done, but you can't appreciate them because the camera stinks and half the time you can't see where your guy is!This is a game that's actually more fun with somebody else, since you don't have to deal with the computer cheese that basically ruins what could have been a fun game...

Unfortunately it is ruined by several significant bugs that make it difficult to finish the game.  Even with the latest patch (1.06) the game seems unfinished.  The graphics are beautiful, some of the best of any game.  I normally turn off the music in games, but I kept it on in Stalker because it was not obtrusive and lent to the atmosphere.  They did a great job of making the world feel realistic, including changing weather and day/night cycles (among other things people sleep and more monsters come out at night).  The mood of the game is genuinely desolate and creepy.  Getting into big gunfights was a lot of fun, especially because the AI opponents are probably the best I've seen in a shooter.  If you attack a group, they all scatter and hide behind cover.  Then some will move around while shooting at you to flush you out from behind your cover while others move to flank you.  Many times I was picking off bad guys at a distance when I got shot in the back of the head by one of their group who silently got behind me!  The big problem that killed the fun is that bad quest management system.  Stalker has many RPG qualities, including non-linear quests.  But to finish the game you need to complete certain quests.  There are multiple endings to the game, and which ending you get depends on which quests you complete and how.  But the game gives you no information to help you decided which choices to make in order to get the most satisfying ending.  I did every quest I could, but could not complete some because of bugs in the game.  And because I could not complete those quests I was not allowed to try to attempt others that were dependent.

So this game really caught my attention. I didn't own a PSP yet so with the announcement of the Dissidia Bundle that came with a PSP 3000...I couldn't pass it up.First the bad:Story 1.5/5Man was I disappointed. There is very little story here and what story does exist is very...very shallow. Like I said, I'm a huge fan of almost all final fantasies and the reason for that is because they have amazing stories (well...except for 12...it was trash). When I first heard about this game, I tried to not expect a whole lot. But when gamespot and IGN gave it really good reviews, my expectations rose quite a bit. Well, as far as the story goes, I was let down. Now on the other hand, this game is a quasi-fighting game. There really isn't any fighting games that have that much of a story. So in that aspect, this game has much more story than...say..soul calibur 4 did. However, the story is still very very shallow.Now the not-so-bad not-so-good:Characters 2.5/5The characters were a wash. I thought they did a great job with the characters of FF 1-6. These characters haven't had a voice or a emotable personality before and this game did really well with them I think. I was a bit disappointed that they kind of made the warrior of light from FF 1 the leader because when you have BAMF's in your party like Cloud, Cecil, Terra, and Squall...it's kind of hard for me to believe they would listen to the WOL. I understand why they did it though so it's just a small complaint. Now the characters after FF VI, Cloud, Squall, and Tidus especially were poorly portrayed as far as I'm concerned. FF fans are much more familiar with these characters' personalities and they basically just summarized their personalities and emphasized their more obvious traits with very little else added. Cloud was just a depressed, non-confident guy that couldn't make up his mind...nothing special. Squall was just a jerk that didn't really have  a personality (yet in FFVIII he didn't really have a personality there either so maybe they did a good job on him) and Tidus' lines can be summed up as ""I hate my dad"" and ""Let's go have some fun."" The enemies were a wash too. Garland, the Emporer, Golbez, and Jecht were done very very well. Their stories really captured my interest. However, characters like Cloud of Darkness, Sephiroth, Kuja, and Exdeath were done very poorly. They could have done a lot with these characters but failed.Now the good:Graphics/Sound 4/5These are some of the best graphics I've seen for the PSP. Granted, my PSP experience is rather limited but I haven't seen anything come close to this. My only real complaint about the graphics is that a lot of the cutscenes are..well..down right amusing. Why amusing? Because a lot of the time the character is speaking and his/her mouth isn't moving...or it is moving and nothing is coming out. So the english dubbing wasn't really done very well. The sound? Amazing. The remixes of the final fantasy songs are just amazing. I loved hearing new renditions of some of the great old songs.  The only thing that could have made it better was if they had made Chaos' music the ""Hell is Bad"" song off of the southpark movie sung by James Hetfield. Kidding. Voice acting? For the most part amazing. Some characters I thought could have been done a bit better (cloud, warrior of light) but for the most part, the voice acting was spot on.Gameplay 5/5Playing this game was really great. I played this game in order of the original 10 games which probably wasn't the best idea because the WOL from FF1 has one of the harder story lines. But this game has amazing replayability and the fighting is done really well. If I were to complain about something, I thought most of the summons were useless and the camera was really really bad at times. But these small flaws don't take much away from playing the game. There was a good mix of easy matches as well as dang near impossible matches.  The RPG elements were mixed in really well I thought. The gameplay of Dissidia really shines and can be very...very addictive.All in all this game is worth a purchase. Definitely worth a rental if you are unsure. Some of the die-hard FF fans may not like it because IMO it does a bad job portraying some of the more beloved characters in the FF universe. You also need to go into this game realizing it's a FIGHTER with some RPG elements thrown in...not the other way around.  If you go in knowing the story is going to be a story in a fighting game, not an RPG, you probably won't mind the story that much. (After all, it pretty much kills any tekken, soul calibur, street fighter story out there) As long as you play it for what it is, you won't be dissappointed.",4,I give it a 3.5,1252972800,"09 15, 2009"

Others have countered by saying that a game like God of War or Metal Gear Solid is repetitive. The reason Tenchu Z feels so much more repetitive is because there is excessive reuse of locales, whereas in God of War for example, the locales are different with each new level. There is no reason for this, other than lack of time or, more likely budget- because if you look at every other Tenchu game, there has never been a repeated locale in a story thread. In this game you play through the same village, castle, whatever several times. After the 2nd time you've just about had enough.- One of the things that made the original Tenchu game so interesting and challenging was that the enemies' ninjas would also hang out on the roofs. In this game, staying on the roof and crouching generally means that no one can reach you. None of the characters seem to climb them, even low roofs.- There is no notion of a boss after each level.

10711,214813,A1KJRT9DJ554SE,B00AY1ALTU,"True Sim Baller ""Smitty""","[2, 3]","This year, I can honestly say that EA Sports has delivered a modest gameplay experience that is finally starting to reflect the missing fundamentals of football in the respective fashion that football communities have been demanding for over this generation of console gaming.  It's only unfortunate that it literally took a generation to turn that corner toward realism and authenticity.  The upside to this is that we have a lot to look forward to when it comes to the next generation from this point in regards of gameplay progression.  With that being said, here are my thoughts regarding NCAA 14:Infinity Engine 2:The gameplay has most definitely been revitalized due to the addition of the Infinity Engine 2.0.  You can clearly see the improved dynamic physical interactions within the game (in comparison to its first implementation in Madden 13).  The physics play out in a cleaner, more dynamic fashion.  For those that may not recall, the Infinity Engine in principle, is a physics driven engine that's layered on top of all the animations within the game.  So, sometimes you'll get dynamic physics-based interactions, as well as scripted animated outcomes, or get a mix of both in some instances, which brings out more organic gameplay. Couple this with the Force Impact System, and now you have the potential to have some of the most violent trucks and Hit Stick tackles occur to date in an EA Sports football title.  The intent of the FIS is make that differential of collisions/interactions between players based on speed, weight, and mass respectively on offense and defense in relation to player skill ratings.  It's very rewarding to see that big TE or power back bowl over smaller DBs or out of position LBs with trucks and stiff arm punches alike.  As well as on defense laying that blind side hit on the QB, or that WR cutting across the middle getting blew up going for a catch by an LB or DB with a good speed and force behind them.With all these good elements, there are issues along with it.  Due to the confines of the animation-based principle of the game, you have situations where scripted animations do overtake the dynamic physical presence of other players, it especially happens the most with some of the scripted stiff arm animations.  I've experienced numerous instances where the animation would run its full course up field for a gain of 4 yards even with defenders charging toward the ball carrier in the opposite direction.  Their tackles are nullified and have no affect on the outcome of the play.  This is an eyesore issue for sure that can hopefully be addressed via patch as this contradicts the principle of the Infinity Engine 2 and all its parts.  Secondly, there's still a good amount of suction tackling taking place within the game as well.  I've had instances where players would purposely get shifted into position as a tackle/stiff arm/Truck is supposed to take place in a particular part on the field.  Which leads to unrealistically scripted gameplay outcomes on both sides of the ball, an issue that's been hindering EA football for years.In the near future (hopefully), it would be nice to see EA have more dynamic physics based gameplay that rivals titles like the 2010 title BackBreaker.  A game that's based on behavior based interactions with dynamic physics and no pre-determined animations in sight.Hard Cuts, The Run Game, and the Option:For the past few years there hasn't been a truly established run game in regards of precise player movement since NCAA Football 11, but even that game had some shortcomings when it came to the EA themed ""Locomotion"" technology.  They definitely made a nice refinement with the addition of the hard cuts in regards to the directional changes made by the ball carrier.  You can see and feel the difference between a power back and a speed back in regards to the ability and sharpness of cutback, juke moves, or just general changes of direction within the game.  You still do see some sliding and gliding and players legs quick shifting to compensate for the respective footplant/cut move accordingly.  With the ""True-Step Locomotion"" technology making its debut in Madden NFL 25 next-gen, we should see the quality of the overall player movement increase dramatically.  In spite of the shortcomings, the addition of the new and various juke/spin move combos (utilizing the right analog stick) nicely adds depth and personality to a vital element of the game that has been long overdue.In addition to compliment the hard cuts element, you have the revamping of the run blocking AI, so this aids in the blockers making more realistic and logical decisions when blocking downfield and addressing the nearest threat to the ball carrier on running plays as well as QB scrambles out of the backfield on passing plays.  The of tandem pass blocking is still an eyesore, but the logic is improved and you see the most realistic pockets and blocking scenarios form in this game that haven't been seen since the Xbox/PS2/GameCube days of EA Sports Football.  Needless to say, there's a lot riding on what's shown on next-gen, especially in this area where 2k Sports currently upholds the standard with NFL 2k5 and APF 2k8 respectively.To expand on the QB scrambling out the backfield, the emphasis on the Option was major this year, with the addition of 30 new types as well as playbooks solely devoted to the option run/pass game.  With the in-game pitch and read keys to look out for prior to the snap.  It's nice to see that you have to pay attention to what the defense does whether it's the pitch, handoff, or keeper.  Any wrong read and be a cost in yards or possible turnover on a bad pitch.Defense:With all the attention given to the offense this year, there still are some elements to highlight in regards of the defensive side of the ball.  The ""Heatseeker"" control is a new element that aids the user controlled defender with taking the proper angle to tackle the ball carrier.  In addition to that, the addressing of proper pursuit angles have finally made their way to being addressed in this year's title.  Now you'll see defenders make the proper angles and breakdown accordingly when going for tackles or to cut across the field to swat or pick.  Also, the revamping of the dive tackles that add that secondary attempt to stop the ballcarrier if they elusively slip past the defender or in a rundown effort to make that shoestring-esque leg sweep from behind tackle.It is nice to say that FINALLY the war in the trenches is BACK!!  The addition of the respective animations for both the O/D-Line interactions showcase that chaotic, yet violent battle that we've been looking for since best being done (at least in my opinion) in All Pro Football 2k8.  Now, you clearly get to see the seperation between elite/mid-level/average/poor rushers as they fight to get in the backfield.  Once again adding more depth and personality to the overall package.The secondary didn't get that much attention this year.  while it's slightly improved, this area needs to be overhauled altogether as you have defenders that legitimately don't react to the ball being thrown right over their head as they look at it.  Now, the Read & React isn't bad, but it's most definitely the weakest link by far in respect to all that was done in this game.  The DB/WR interactions need to be revamped, as well as the AI across the board.  Hopefully, the next generation of NCAA Football gaming coupled with the IGNITE engine, will showcase a drastic change in the way players react in game with the dubbed ""human intelligence"" element to the way the secondary reacts accordingly to what the offense gives them.Overall, NCAA Football 14 is a glimpse of the potential future of EA Sports football gaming, with Madden 25 on the horizon to be releasing on August 27 for current gen, and next-gen sometime this holiday season.  This is a very nice offering for a soon to be ending console generation, especially for the collegiate football gamer.",4,Simualation football making it's way back,1373673600,"07 13, 2013"

Just a bunch of cars the normal guy could never do more than dream of driving, that you could race. from there things have gone down hill need for speed 2 lowered the detail of the cars, but added a few more name tags, then they went and added cars that you had to find a way to unlock (not at all simple and straight forward like the first one).Then they added police chases (which was a lot of fun until you figured out that all you had to do was keep driving and ignore them), then the police got a bit smarter and harder to avoid (spike strips are very annoying).Then things really got stupid when they started making games about cars that anyone can pick up for almost nothing.  Of course there were mods and such to make them run better and a back story to go with it but that's not at all what need for speed started out to do. It was a simple idea that had go terribly wrong.  when you start a game with a used Mazda or nissan as your car, you feel a bit ripped off, it used to be corvettes, lambo's, and Ferrari'sDon't get me wrong they were fun games, but something has been missing, they have fallen from the need for speed ideal to being about making, well basiclly just another game for the masses, that is so much like other racing games that it doesn't matter much if you get a need for speed game or the other one.Then they made the new hot pursuit, which stood out from the drivel they have been putting out, and was a good game, not quite as straight forward as the first game, but everyone has to evolve with the times.  There is a great selection of high end cars and allot places to drive them.  so I was pulled back into the need for speed world, and decided to try to get them all (what a waste of money).The run is kinda of a take of of the old as dirt movie cannonball run, or gumball rally if you prefer.  They are both old as heck and have the same story line.  Basically your in a race across the u.s.a. The problem with this game is obvious from the start. You have to interact with what should just be the starting back story shot, need for speed is about driving, not getting out of a car, the game should have started when you got into the car, not before, whoever came up with that idea should be drug out in the street and flogged. Then when you get in the car it says to get away from the mob, Okay no problem, lets just go up here a bit and grab a side street after letting them get just a bit of a lead, NOT.  This game doesn't let you take side streets to evade anyone it makes you just go one direction, its a race to the finish where a train gets them off your tail, Dull, unimaginative, and just plain lame.Then you get to race across the country in short stages, of about 4 miles but when it shows your progress the 12 miles you have raced is shown as 145 miles.  You race from checkpoint to checkpoint with no other racers around for a stage, then they let you race other racers, but only a few, and tell you how many you have to pass in order to pass the stage. I don't know what they were thinking when they made this game. If this is your first need for speed game I apologize on behalf of the makers of the game, and ask that you please try one out the new hot pursuit, at least give the need for speed name a second chance with a game that's worth playing.If you haven't purchased this game already, DON'T!!!!  get another racing game that will hold your interest long enough to play it for more time than it takes to install.",2,I have loved need for speed from the first one they made,1358294400,"01 16, 2013"

6975,63485,A1JNO7TUTDPGZ6,B000BKF2I4,Thomas Twain,"[4, 4]","I got this posting from a former guild of mine when I was doing SWG. Looks like the SWG problems made the NY timesBy SETH SCHIESELPublished: December 10, 2005For two and a half years, Emily E. LaBeff, chairwoman of the sociology department at Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Tex., spent 30 hours or more each week playing the online computer game Star Wars Galaxies. Not for research, but for fun.Logging on to the game on weekends and many nights after class, Ms. LaBeff directed Athena Wavingrider, a powerful Jedi she created, through the far corners of the Star Wars universe, fighting on behalf of the Rebel Alliance against the tyranny of the Galactic Empire. Like millions of other online gamers, Ms. LaBeff, 54, discovered a camaraderie and friendship with other players that were far more important than the play itself - relationships that can be hard to replicate in ""real life.""""It's replaced my television time, and I don't go to the movies anymore,"" she said, chuckling. ""I don't keep my car as clean as I used to. But it's not because of the game itself. It's because of the people."" She added, ""We all had this wonderful second life together.""And now it's all gone, at least in any form that Ms. LaBeff and thousands of other Star Wars Galaxies veterans would recognize.Last month, LucasArts and Sony's online game division, which have jointly run Star Wars Galaxies since its introduction in 2003, suddenly turned the game upside down, making the most sweeping changes ever made to a persistent online game. (""Persistent"" means that the game world is constantly running, and players may log in and out as they please.) Unsatisfied with the product's merely moderate success, the companies radically revamped the game in an attempt to appeal to a younger, more trigger-happy audience.Previously, the game was unabashedly complicated, appealing to mature, reflex-challenged gamers with its strategic combat style and deep skill system, which allowed players to carve out profitable, powerful niches as entertainers, architects and politicians. Now the game has become self-consciously simple, with a basic point-and-click combat system that is meant to evoke the frenetic firefights of the ""Star Wars"" films.To Sony and LucasArts, the changes are a necessary step to help the game appeal to a broader audience. (The companies do not release subscriber figures, but many gaming experts believe that before the changes, Star Wars Galaxies had about 200,000 subscribers, each paying about $15 a month.) But to thousands of players, the shifts have meant the destruction of online communities that they might have spent hundreds or even thousands of hours constructing. Now many Galaxies players are canceling their accounts and migrating to other online games. They are swapping tales on ""refugee"" Web sites with names like Imperial Crackdown (imperialcrackdown.com). Ms. LaBeff, for instance, said that she had canceled all three of her Galaxies accounts and had joined a new guild in World of Warcraft, another game, with her old Star Wars friends.""Someone might wonder, well, it's just a game, what's the big deal?"" said Robert Kruck, 54, an engineer for Motorola who lives in Schaumburg, Ill., who said he had canceled seven of his eight Galaxies accounts. ""But for many people it is much more than a game,"" he said. ""It is a part of their lives where they have invested huge amounts of time building a community. And that community has been based on a sophisticated, mature game. So now, for them to take an adult-level combat and economics simulation and turn it into a mindless game for 10-year-olds is a violation of that community.""For Sony and LucasArts, the idea has been to make the game more ""Star Wars-like,"" tying it more explicitly to the films.""We really just needed to make the game a lot more accessible to a much broader player base,"" said Nancy MacIntyre, the game's senior director at LucasArts. ""There was lots of reading, much too much, in the game. There was a lot of wandering around learning about different abilities. We really needed to give people the experience of being Han Solo or Luke Skywalker rather than being Uncle Owen, the moisture farmer. We wanted more instant gratification: kill, get treasure, repeat. We needed to give people more of an opportunity to be a part of what they have seen in the movies rather than something they had created themselves.""Ms. MacIntyre said Galaxies had lost ""significantly more"" than the 3 to 5 percent of players who typically leave any online game every month. She said she expected the game to return to its previous subscriber levels in six months, a process she hoped would be accelerated by the introduction of a new television infomercial hawking Galaxies later this month.""We knew we were taking a significant risk with our existing player base, but we felt so strongly that we needed to make these changes for the sake of the game's long-term future that we all held hands, LucasArts and Sony, and went forward,"" Ms. MacIntyre said.It may, however, be a rocky path, because the revamped game is receiving mostly horrible reviews from players. On Gamespot.com, a leading game Web site, about half of the more than 600 players evaluating the game have rated it ""abysmal."" Some 14 percent have called it ""terrible,"" and 6 percent have described it as merely ""bad."" The game is described as ""perfect"" by about 12 percent and ""other"" by 18 percent.""We just feel violated,"" said Carolyn R. Hocke, 46, a marketing Web technician for Ministry Medical Group and St. Michael's Hospital in Stevens Point, Wis. Ms. Hocke said she once had as many as 10 separate Galaxies accounts but has canceled all but one in the last two weeks.""For them to just come along and destroy our community has prompted a lot of death-in-the-family-type grieving,"" she said. ""They went through the astonishment and denial, then they went to the anger part of it, and now they are going through the sad and helpless part of grieving. I work in the health-care industry, and it's very similar.""Now, then it looks like that Smedly his very hell bent on staying the game's exisiting course-looks like they would rather see the game stopped then attempt to save it or give into player pressure. There is a possible date of Feb 2006 when LA and SOE are going to meet and rather decide to keep this going or stop it totally.It is about time SOE stop living there dream world and face up to reality. SWG should not be turned into something it isn't. It was find under the orginal system. But to make sudden changes without player support is plain insane. They can make all the changes they want, just dont except the general public to pay for crap.As for the YAY sayers, the SOE defenders go a head and defend this crap-just realize that SWG days are now getting numbered.",1,THIS MADE THE NY TIMES,1132617600,"11 22, 2005"

4166,197117,A26G35WR7QCFR2,B006ULENFG,Kevbo,"[12, 67]","I have only had bad experiences with Paradox.  They all began a few years ago when I bought Europa Universalis III: Complete.  Well, the game turned out not to be complete at all, as they released one or two more expansions after the ""complete"" version.  When I went onto their website, Paradox had web forums that were poorly moderated.  Worse was that they refused to put a Search function on the forums pages since it ""cost too much.""I looked at their website recently and saw that they instituted a search funtion finally, as if that was a big deal or something.  But I noticed that Paradox remains a Swedish company that performs some of the worst customer service that you will receive.  The arrogance and the talking down to people...  I read what some of their moderators and game designers wrote, and at first I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt - maybe they just suck at English.  But I read other posts from honest customers who got the same treatment.  So there was no way I was going to post anything on there again, and that basically meant that I wanted nothing to do with Paradox.Besides running their company like a bunch of ingrates, the games that Paradox Interactive releases are intentional cheapshots.  What I mean by that is that they are blatantly trying to make money off those who are willing to be less than smart with their money.  In other words, Paradox Interactive is exploitive.  While they are free to do what they want, what they choose to do is so trashy, if you will.  For example, they release a video game that is not complete and has a few bugs.  They might patch it once.  Then they release an expansion pack for it.  The expansion includes things that make you think, ""Why didn't they just release this with the original game?  Why did they intentionally hold it back?""  The reason: they are just trying to milk you.  While they are free to do so, it is just a cheap way to do business and makes Paradox look greedy and desperate.With Crusader Kings II, you can see this trashiness.  Check out how many expansions they have and how much DLC is out there.  The DLC seems less of a cheapshot, as they are supplemental, while the expansions are blatant attempts to release the game in pieces to see how much money this Swedish company can make off its fans.  For example, you might be wondering why spending $40 on a game is a good idea and why spending $80 is not.  Well, if you want to be able to play more than 400 years in Crusader Kings II, then you will have to buy $10 expansions here and there.  Then you ask yourself, why not just make a game release it?  Why put a game together, then take things out in order to formulate an expansion pack?I would think a logical, reasonable person would deduce two things after having dealt with Paradox Interactive:1)  If you want to give this wreckless Swedish company your money, then wait until the ""complete"" or ""gold"" version of the game comes out, where everything is included: base game, expansions, DLC, and whatever else.  Never give Paradox Interactive money upfront so that they can continue the bad business practice of exploitation and cheapshots.  The power is in your hands to make them do what you want.  Don't reward bad behavior.2)  Maybe you were insulted like I was.  Maybe you don't like putting up with stupid people on a company's website who are abusive - even employees of the company!  Never mind the dweeb Europeans that are jealous of Americans - when the moderators and designers post things that are offensive or just stupid, you realize this is a poorly run company.  And maybe you don't tolerate cheapness, such as overt attempts to milk you when you've played their games for years, and then they try to stick it to you.  And maybe you don't like false advertising - another cheapshot - such as putting the word ""complete"" on a non-complete version.  And maybe you don't want to play the non-video game games, such as waiting for them to internally fix themselves or to invest money into their community, such as providing better customer support and forums.  Instead of putting up with their crap, you instead decide to boycott this bad company.Whatever the case, when I checked back with Paradox Interactive recently, I saw that they were the same bad company as when I first met them a few years ago.  Nothing has changed.  And I look at their ridiculously long line of expansions and DLC for this one game, Crusader Kings II, and realize that they want us to spend $80 on a game that is worth between $20 and $30, complete.  When will the complete version come out?  Will it actually be complete, or will they expand the complete version?  Why don't you ask them on their forums page?  What if you have problems with bugs and things - should you post on the forums?I have had enough with this Swedish company, and they will not get my money.  Not ever.  I made this decision based on the way they do business, which is cheap and often rude.  Just a trashy lot.  Let them figure it out when their sales diminish.  Don't reward stupid behavior.",1,Be Careful with Paradox,1359072000,"01 25, 2013"

One of its flagship titles was Coded Arms. Unfortunately, after all the hype and all the screenshots, Coded Arms fails to live up to lofty expectations.Graphically, Coded Arms is absolutely gorgeous. Considering this is a first generation PSP game and that the hardware can still dish out so much more is simply amazing. The visuals are extremely polished, very good and the game has no slowdown. Unfortunately, most of the game is spent indoors in factories and simulations, so they never really are fully appreciated. The music doesn't really wow, and considering it is an FPS, it doesn't really need to. It's solid and such in terms of effects, so there aren't really any problems in these two categories.Where Konami really dropped the ball was just about everything else. The controls give you a variety of options, but the default settings are garbage; you will almost certainly need to go back and recalibrate it for more comfort. The PSP can play an FPS for sure after you get used to it, just not as comfortably as you might want it to.The gameplay is what really drags the game down. The game really is nothing more than a simulator. It creates a bunch of random stages that mostly look the same. While you would think that would be better for replay value, the fact is that most of the stages randomly created have just been changed slightly perhaps in enemy locations, but really, they are all virtually the same with the same enemies. Doing so makes things more complicated than necessary, but really gives you the feeling that the developers were too lazy to design real levels and so just added in a random generator as an excuse. Enemy variety is almost non-existent as well, and even the ones that are present are very bland and unexciting.Coded Arms, with just a bit of tweaking, mainly in its gameplay and controls could have been an amazing game. It's easily and quite possibly, the best looking handheld game on the market, but you wouldn't know that based on it's generic and unwelcoming look right down to the box art.

I've always been a HUGE fan of the Burnout franchise, but this latest installment has me a bit perplexed.  Mainly the lack of a restart button during races.  The open racing world is fun but many times you'll take a turn that you shouldn't have and end up losing the race because of it.  The lack of a restart button forces you to finish a race that you're going to lose and then drive all the way back to the starting point (granted you don't have to drive back you can just start a different race, but it's contrary to the way that every other racing game out there functions.)Stunt runs and Road Rages are great fun in the new open city as it doesn't really matter what direction you go.  Plus the world is chock full of fun things to discover.  It's only problematic when you try to race as looking at your map while driving 200 miles an hour and dodging traffic is a bit frustrating at times.Other reviewers have already mentioned it, but the lack of split-screen multiplay is extremely strange.

This Wii game, Super Paper Mario, is the sequel to Paper Mario-The Thousand Year Door and Paper Mario for Nintendo 64. I would rate this game a 5 out of 5. First off, the story is wonderful. Peach and Bowser actually get married!! You meet a mysterious Count who refers to himself in the third person (namely, Count Bleck), a friendly talking butterfly named Tippi who is also a Pixl (a magic being with powers, in this case tipping people on what they're supposed to do, hence her name), and Merlon, a Mario replica of Merlin the Magician. You can also (besides playing as Mario) play as Luigi, Princess Peach, and even Bowser! You get many different Pixls, including Tippi, whom you use throughout the game. There are even optional Pixls (three of them, in fact). Another reason this game is superlative is that it's a part RPG, part platformer type of game. This means that it has all the fun RPG aspects, including Mario's amazing ability to flip between 2D and 3D with the press of a button, and still has interesting and colorful levels. One other thing I liked is that you can purchase and sell items, making the game very realistic. To add to the realism, the items you want to sell, that you purchased, can only be sold for half the original purchase price, as they are now used. The game also has excellent music; the tunes are quite catchy. This game is also very long, and you will be playing it quite a bit, to get all the items, Pixls, and complete all the side quests. The characters are loveable as well. Even Bowser is a multi-layered character. Though this doesn't matter much, the game also has gorgeous graphics. Part of their charm is that they're not trying to be realistic, just colorful and papery. To go with the game's title and the series, items that you cannot pass or get in 2D can only be accessed in 3D, as they're being blocked by a papery substance. Sometimes, you must stay in 2D, for platforms that look to be sturdy are actually paper thin in 3D and cause you to fall down through them. These are only a few reasons why I believe this game is the best game for the Nintendo Wii system. I hope you also purchase this game and enjoy it as much as I did.",5,A 12-year-old's review,1290211200,"11 20, 2010"

Lin ""I'm too lazy for signature""","[5, 12]","Don't get me wrong, I was really looking forward to this game (while my friend is actually the one will buy it this time, we have a shared game library). I was hoping you can shoot when you are scattered into pieces or you can stick your head into your leg and run like a freak, all that kind of crazy stuff. But nothing is offered in this game. In a word: don't buy it. If you have to spend 60 bucks on something, go eat a buffet, buy some vegetable then ask a friend for some coffee, you may use the left over 19.99 to buy a game way better than this.Graphic: 7/10It's decent, nothing special. The models look OK, the framerates are solid (most of the time). But don't expect anything special here. It is just average level.Sounds: 7/10Again it's OK. Some BGM has enjoyable tones but most of the time it's there but not catchy. Voice acting of Bryce (the undead guy on the cover picture) is passable but his ""partner"" (sort of) , Arcadia's voice is unbearable, especially you have her yelling at your ears saying the same line many many times during a prolonged boring boss fight.Story: 4/10Is there a story at all? I doubt it. It's just like Bryce ""somehow"" become immortal then ""somehow"" became a demon hunter and then ""somehow"" took on some weird quests going here and there. To be honest I have no idea what the story is about (we are 4 hours in) and the game never cares to explain it to you.Gameplay: 2/10Now this is the part that REALLY RUINS your whole experience. The game tries to be a third person shooter and there are many many good examples to compare in the market. The good thing first: the shooting works fine, although I feel it's not quick enough in responds sometimes. The arsenal has a acceptable size, you got plenty options to customize them. And that's about it for the pros. Now here are why you should not buy the game, at least for now: As the title implies, you are an undead guy which can't be killed in the game.There's no HP bar of anything to limit the amount of hits you can take. You can be kill actually, by being swallowed by some hard to name flower(?) on the ground, but you have to REALLY try hard to die. Basically when you get hit, your body parts fall off and you can only control your head to roll to your body or limbs to recover. Sounds fun right? Yes, it was --- for the first 5 or 10 times. Then this mechanism turn into the most boring setting I've never met. Touching an electric plug makes your leg fell off. A small bite of your enemy, which if bite on me I may rescue it by a little bandage, makes all your four limbs fly out. A hit by a charging enemy, which in other games may cause a 5% HP lose, can instantly makes your whole body into pieces! So think about this, you encounter a pack of enemies, shoot for 30 seconds, the fall into pieces, now you have to spend 15 second roll your head to the body parts to regenerate ""yourself"", shoot for another 30 second, then you roll your head again for 15 seconds, repeat this OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER. Will you have fun or you wish you are playing the game ""CanbeDead"" which has a standard HP bar?Even worst is, while you have a fair amount of weapon, the enemy types are incredibly limited: we see less than 5 types of enemies in our 4 hours. Most of the times they just change a color and have exactly the same attack pattern. And the bosses are so uninspired that I think the Castlevania on NES back to the 80s' has a better setting. There are no strategy at all in boss fights because they can't kill you. You just do what I mentioned: shoot, roll your head, shoot.All in all, we may still finish this game because my friend who's crying for his 60 bucks wants to make the 60 bucks ""worthy"". And to you, the potential buyers, please steer away from this game. When it drops to 19.99 and on sale for a 10.99 price, you may give it a try. But for 60 bucks, this game will hurt you mentally. Go spend it on a buffet, Chinese noodles, Sushi, whatever you want.

The Genius wheel had not worked (except for vibrating), but using the Thrustmaster, I was able to get rolling. However, the ""up"" shifter has broken after two months (my earlier review had expressed uncertainty on the durability). The wheel has accurate steering on the GTR Evolution game I purchased from Amazon (recommended). After logging in around 30 hours of racing, the up shifter broke. I have now switched the up gear shifting to a button, which is a little awkward to reach while trying to shift quickly. The wheel was not compatible with Need for Speed: Shift that I also ordered.  Even after adjusting the steering sensitivity to 100%, the best the Shift game would do was to have the car zig/zag slowly on the track--get GTR Evolution. I tried to treat the wheel gently, within reason, and the shifter still broke. Thrustmaster says it has a two year warranty. I haven't sent it back yet to check out the coverage.

I didn't play the first game, Mark of Kri until later, but I was able to pick up the story well enough.  Some review sites said it was confusing because it jumped around, but I found it perfectly fine.Before I get into reviewing, there are two important things you need to know.1)  All the cheat sites say that having aMark of Krisave on your memory card will unlock all the costumes.  That's not entirely accurate.  You must have a completed game save and then it only unlocks the remaining outfits that you cannot unlock by beating the Arena challenges.2)  BE VERY CAREFUL COMPLETING THE CHALLENGES!  If you finish all the tasks, but then die before you reach the save point, do not save your game.  There is a fatal glitch when unlocking content that will register all tasks as completed, but won't unlock the associated content if you die before you save.  You're only solution then is to delete your save file and start over!I can respect the targeting control scheme that they settled on, even if I don't particularly care for it.  You use the right analog stick to paint targets on your enemies, then use one of the four shape buttons on the controller to target them, regardless of if they are on screen or not.  It's a nice idea, but I found it seemed to mess with my successfully executing combos.  It also limits the number of moves you have, so there's no jump button.  Looking around corners is a royal pain, though you do have an ability to possess the lamppost things and use them to sneak a peak at enemies.  The stealth in the game was hit and miss, but when it worked the stealth kills were pretty cool.  Really though, you can mostly play the whole game just running right into the mess of bad guys and coming out on top.  I never bothered to do much of anything with it until the very end of the game.You have a total of four choices of characters, though characters play in pairs.  In past levels, you can pick either the Barbarian or the stringy guy.  In current levels, you can pick the Barbarian or the chick.  In either case, one plays like a big warrior, the other a faster assassin.  Personally, I went with the faster warriors almost every time.  You also have some choice of weapon you use and it matters where you use them.  For example, you can go with bigger, slower weapons, but you might get overrun by faster enemies.  If you fight next to a wall your big long axe will bounce off walls or get stuck in wooden beams.  It was nicely done overall.The real problem comes from all the glitches.  I did get stuck in a wall once, but was able to escape by attacking an enemy.  The combo system is a train wreck, with combos failing to register more often than they work.  The AI on your partner is a little flaky at times and just sits there for no reason, but is often really handy in the fights.  I had numerous freezes when watching the movies.  Normally you could just skip the movies, but they're really the point to playing the game at all.  It was annoying to have to finish a battle, watch part of the movie, see it freeze, then restart and have to fight the battle again.  The game provides a really good number of save points that you can use or even skip if you want the challenge, but they would have done much better to let you save before you trigger the movie.If you're looking for a really deep game you can play over and over, you probably want to look elsewhere.  If you're looking for something inexpensive that tells a good story and is enough fun to play through once, then by all means give it a try.",3,Nice Idea Flawed Execution,1268179200,"03 10, 2010"

4829,28667,A3L6S86HGO9OUW,B000066TS5,Madisen,"[25, 58]","This game has a great idea behind it. Putting characters from two beloved franchises (Final Fantasy and Disney) into a brand-new storyline with a few new, original characters is a stroke of genius, and it works well. The environments are colorful and perfectly capture the fantasy vibe; the original PSone models of old FF characters are brought to the next-gen world with great graphics and superb voice-acting. The story itself is also interesting. So I happily leapt into this game, really excited about the whole thing.Then, something terrible happened: gameplay. Sora (the main character) moves so clunkily and imprecisely that both combat and exploration are a chore. If battles were turn-based in classic Square fashion, this would be easier to deal with, but they're not. They're done in real-time, meaning that you are never given a rest from the painful controls. No matter how fast I tapped the buttons or moved the control stick, Sora's attacks were always several steps behind my commands. And when I was platforming in the ""exploration"" segments, his pitiful jumps and tendency to keep moving once I released the analog stick was continually frustrating.All this wouldn't be so bad if the game was forgiving enough to accomodate the interface, but that isn't the case. Indeed, the difficulty is actually harder than many games I've played with better control schemes. Enemies are whip-quick and surround you in a flash; platforms are tiny and widely spaced; and replenishing items are always in short supply.Another complaint I have is that the puzzles don't make sense. Unlike better RPGs (Paper Mario 2, for example), where you can analyze the area and figure out what you're supposed to do, Kingdom Hearts gives you no clues. I would have been stumped within minutes if I didn't have the strategy guide to back me up. Like everything else in the game, the puzzles must be done perfectly, with no mistakes, or you have to start over. Seeing as you don't know if something is a mistake or not until you do it, this gets very tedious and frustrating.Overall, playing this game felt like trying to dismantle a ticking time bomb with no tools, where touching one wire could mean death: stressful, confusing, and definitely not fun. And after a while, it doesn't even matter that the bomb is decorated with beloved characters and bright colors.",1,"Excellent concept, shoddy gameplay.",1113091200,"04 10, 2005"

It's a standalone game, includes six races, a good selection of maps, and a campaign with some replay value. If you are already familiar with DoW2, Retribution will be easy to get into. There are no major changes, besides the addition of the Imperial Guard, a unit per race, and a new single-player campaign that can be played by any of the six races (though it is still basically the same campaign).The big draw here is the gameplay. It's violent, over-the-top, and addictively fun. The graphics are gorgeous, with good animations and realistic scenary. Also, the sound work is quite well done, with solid voice acting, effects, and music. The innovation that DoW2 introduces to the RTS genre is the roleplaying elements, in which you get to level-up your units during fights and customize your commander's gear. This works especially well in the campaign, where you have a lot of choices regarding units, wargear, and how you deploy them during missions. Although the campaign allows you to recruit units during missions, the skirmish mode is still about fairly small engagements centering around a handful of squads. Nonetheless, it's great fun and will have some lasting appeal to RTS fans and for those who like the W40K world.At this price, Retribution is a good buy, especially for newcomers. However, the game still has many of the same problems as the previous one. The skirmish AI is still shotty, even after 2 expansions. The Eldar and Imperial Guard are especially bad, rarely producing vehicles. Also, Relic has provided very little modding support, and I would be surprised if another patch is forthcoming. Furthermore, I'm not a fan of Steam, which this game depends on for DRM and online ""services."" With all of this in mind, there is still some fun to be had with this game. Definitely, the best in the series, though the first Dawn of War game is still the superior product.EDIT: I should note that the game can have some long load times, but nothing unbearable.

Some of the details in Touch Detective are absurd, and can leave you stuck for quite some time, as you try to figure out what tiny detail you need to uncover to move forward in the game.Aside from the mediocre gameplay, the graphics are actually quite nice, a darker, more emo-ish presentation than normally seen on the happy, cartoony graphics of most games on the DS.

The increasingly growing number of people who love Madden and hate the NFL 2K series, and the increasingly shrinking number of people who love the NFL 2K series, but hate Madden.  I can say I belong to neither.  I loved Madden '97 for the PC, but Madden 2001 for the PC was beyond terrible.  I really enjoyed NFL 2K and 2K1, but NFL 2K3 has got to be of one the worst sequels of all time - up there with the Attack of the Clones.So, I bought Madden 2003 a month and a half ago.  While it's not a great game, it certainly is no slouch.  Here are my thoughts and observations after 3+ seasons in Franchise mode.So, I started off in Pro level, and finished 6-10.  The next season I won the Super Bowl with 12-4 record.  Woohoo!  My final season, I switched to All-Pro level, and won the Super Bowl with a 14-2 record.  Woohoo?  I thought that it was strange that I did better switching from Pro to All Pro.  Then I played half a game in All Madden.  I went long ever play, completed 278 yards of passing and ended with a 156 QB rating by the end of the half.  I stopped the game because I knew this game was screwy.First off, there is an overwhelming abundance of useless and annoying bells and whistles.  For example, before many plays, they throw some statistics on the screen like 3rd down conversions percentage or something like that.  While that is somewhat interesting, it blocks your sight and you can't see the opposing formation.  You either have to call an audible and cancel, or wait for the stats to disappear, all the while the play clock is running.  Worst off, you cannot turn it off.  Also, there's the music.  While some of the songs are good, there are some extremely girly bands out there that don't deserve to be associated with a manly game like Football.  Good Charlotte and Bon Jovi should just stick with MTV and leave me alone in my own bastion of masculinity.  Fortunately, you can actually turn the music off.  Other things, like challenges are annoying.  Why have referee induced instant replay challenges?  In real football, referees sometimes challenge themselves because they need to refer to instant reply with less than 2 minutes left in the half.  In Madden, the same game that renders the image controls the referee.  It should be 100 percent accurate.  It shouldn't correct itself and force me to watch a stupid video of itself challenging itself and telling itself that it's overturned.  Absolutely pointless.  There's also pointless things like Madden challenges and Madden cards which really detract from the core football game.After the forty odd games of playing, I learned that offense was really, really easy.  For some reason, the computer had this overwhelming urge to stop the run.  It would set up some tough, tough run defenses.  My average was a mere 2.5 yards a carry.  So I did the logical thing, I passed.  The computer never adapted.  I had an arsenal of about 4 plays that consisted 80% of my downs because the AI would refuse to adapt to my game play.  The game really sides with long passes.  Couple this with the fact that in harder levels, players would just drop catches, and the overall lack of YAC yards, it pretty much renders high percentage West Coast style offenses useless.  The AI is just begging you to turn into Steve Spurrier and go Fun-and-Gun on them.  You can toss it up forty yards all the time, and never worry about an interception.Defense is another matter.  Sacks for either side are rare indeed.  The corners were just plain dumb and half the time are just plain useless either whether the computer controls the CB or whether you do.  Penetrating the defensive line was really difficult.  Stopping a drive was hard.  You had to hope the computer ran a lot, the running backs or O-line would miss the blitzing linebacker or cornerback on passing plays, and that the receivers would drop balls passed right to them.Finally, some parts of the game were just whacked.  It seems to be obsessed with inches to go.  Every drive I would have at least one or two 3rd and inches.  Sometimes, a couple of players on either side would turn themselves into Jesus with a helmet.  Those usually accounted for my losses.  When one of my receivers turned into Jesus, I would pass to him all day long and be assured of a completion.  Also, the computer liked throwing in artificial suspense.  For example - the last two minutes of my last Super Bowl.  Even though there were no turnovers in the game until then, in just the final two minutes, there was a fumble, an interception when the ball bounced off the receivers helmet, another two separate defensive interceptions in the offensive endzone, a punt return of 51 yards, and two timely penalties that stopped the clock so the other teams last second drive can continue.  If that is not artificially induced, then the laws of mathematics have changed.  I learned that in order to avoid this, I just made sure to kill time in last quarter of the game, instead of actually playing the game itself.Okay, now for the good.  This is NOT NFL 2k3.  Which means it's playable and enjoyable and you progressively improve - as opposed to Sega's bankruptcy inducing debacle.  Also, the online is suppose to be really good, and it's free until August 2003.  Reading the receivers on offense is very intuitive and fun.  The franchise mode is also interesting.  Drafting, though time consuming, is worthwhile.  You can really define your franchise for years to come.  The mini camp and football 101 are great ways to familiarize yourself with the game.  Practicing and mastering this game is worthwhile as well.  The graphics are decent, and the stadiums and field are nice as well.All in all, it's the best new football game out there, but it's got a lot of flaws to get around.",3,"The Real, IMPARTIAL, Lowdown",1053993600,"05 27, 2003"

The ability to create your own civilization from the stone age to the time of the romans. Then i heard there was going to be sequel and i knew i had to get it. I was immediatly got hooked to AOK (Age of Kings). It was superior in every way to the original but it had some minor flaws such as no farm queing which complicated the economics during battles because you have to always replant farms manuelly. Not to mention some imbalances between the civilizations, Teutons were practically unstoppable. These are somewhat small complaints, and the game is extremely fun to play both on and offline, but better online against other players.  Now that the Expansion pack is here the gameplay is even better since it improves on the game rather than give us more maps. One of the best improvements is the sorly missed farm queing i refered to before, now you add extra farms so it can automatically set up another right off, this saves valuable time when in battle. Another improvement is the unit AI especially the villagers once they build a resource structure they automatically start the job rather than stand around waiting for orders.

(again, i realize this was made for the PC, but...) the textures are mostly muddy.  the maps that came on the disc weren't nearly as balanced or as well-designed as the BFBC2 maps (operation metro and grand bazaar come to mind).  there are some really great maps, though, like caspian border, kharg island, and operation firestorm; but to me they just don't compare to oasis, laguna presa/alta, arica harbor and atacama desert.  the gameplay, too, doesn't fare as well.  if i had a dollar for every time i unloaded an entire mag into someone only to have them kill me 100% health, i'd be pretty well off. i get that there will always be lag, but it's bordering on the criminal. it's no fun to shoot someone with a shotgun, twice, from point blank range and have them just run away from you.  every now and then, i get it.  but not a dozen times a game.  at the end of most matches i just feel defeated.unfortunately, for me, BF3 was a disappointment.  BFBC2 is my favorite game ever. i logged well or 600 hours in the MP.  after about 40 in BF3, i'm done.",3,"pretty terrible campaign, multiplayer needs some improvements",1329091200,"02 13, 2012"

2974,15137,ADJKMC7AO7YN3,B00004ZBOD,Amazon Customer,"[36, 38]","Over two years have passed since the original Gangsters.  While the original clearly had carved out a new niche genre, it was mired in complexity and micromanagement.  Not so with Gangsters 2.Hot House and Eidos listened to the gamers feedback and implemented many features to make Gangsters 2 much more accessible to players.  The first thing you will notice is a much more intuitive interface.  While I am still a little hesitant to give the interface a glowing review (It's a bit tricky to read some windows and decipher information at the building level), it is much more simpler than the original.  And with the lack of micromanagement of each individual gangster (like the original), you control the main character, Joey Bane, and his lieutenants.  All other hired muscle is controlled by you immediate family or built in AI scripts which are pretty good.Upon loading the game, you will notice that Gangsters 2 revolves around the story of Joey Bane, (you).  It seems your father (a big time mobster) was killed by the opposing family moving into the city.  It is your job, over individual episodes, to move back into your home town, avenge your fathers death, and assume the role of mob leader.  You start small, just taking over a neighborhood, but as he story progresses and you move on to episodes, you eventually take over the city, then neighboring cities, then eventually cross state lines setting up your empire.Cut scenes between each episode move the story along in a concise fashion, and a pre-episode briefing is really good in defining your primary and secondary objectives.  There is good feedback (could always be better) during the game from a 'family' advisor and reading the local newspaper.  The Newspaper all allows you to hire 'specialists' that can carry on special assignments for you, lists obituaries, and clues you into other subtle hints and game progress.The graphics are pretty good, but not top notch.  A new addition to the game is being able to play at night, where street lamps light the streets and shading effects are more visible.  Also there are seasons, so later in the game you'll notice the snow falling.Game control is better than the original but is still tricky.  Good thing there is a pause button (the game is real time) to re-issue orders.  I found I made a few errors in assigning tasks to my gangsters only because selecting them is very sensitive.  Game A.I. is also good, but could be better.  When in trouble I have selected my gangsters to flee, only for them to sit around idle for a few seconds and get shot at before they run.  And they seem to sometime run the wrong way!  Also navigating your cars can be a bit frustrating.  Seems that sometimes that computer chooses the longest path to get somewhere via car, when your car could easily take a turn down another street and get to a destination in half the time.The manual is nice, explains pretty thoroughly what you can and can not do, and even walks you through the 1st two episodes.  The only complaint about the manual is a few screenshots used for explanation are blurry.Gangsters 2 offers multiplayer support!!  Now that's awesome.  You can have up to 4 Godfathers trying to compete over a city.  However, it would have been much better if there was a random map generator for not only multi, but single players as well.  After you complete the game in 16 episodes, you just restart it again at a higher difficulty level, but it's the same cities and same objectives.As you move on from episode to episode, you take your hired hands with you, and dole out experience points to them in different categories based on performance: combat, stealth, or special skill (diplomat, distiller, bomber, hit man, driver, etc..)When you take over buildings in the city, either by buying them, by force, etc., you must stay in control.  For the building generate you money, and if you set up an illegal business (speakeasy, card den, brothels, brewery, distiller, gun smith, etc..) you rake in more money to expand your empire.  Use money to buy better guns, recruit muscle, buy better armored cars, and buy influence over the police, the judge, the DA, etc...Bribery is big, however, the FBI are incorruptible, but every other figure in the game is.  I love the drive by shootings!!!  I often eliminate my opponent by taking out enemy gangs by Tommy and shotguns via a drive by, hop out of the car, and bust up their business (either by bombing, or killing those inside massacre style) and speed off before the police arrive.  This disrupts the cash flow for your opponent, and even better if you can capture the business yourself and set up shop.  You generate more money while increasing your influence in town!  But be careful, you better hire guards for you new place, because your opponent doesn't like you taking over and will soon dispatch his own thugs to reclaim lost businesses.One of your gang members in jail?  No problem!  Maybe you just need to put the judge or the DA on your payroll.  Or maybe a breakout is more your style.I'm just touching the base of things you can do.  There are many illegal business to set up, cars to steal, people to kidnap, patrol your area, buy of the mayor, etc....All in all, a very worthy sequel and worth the money.",4,"Better than the original, simpler yet highly addictive.",991958400,"06 8, 2001"

It suggests fun, great visuals, and a stellar, epic storyline. In (game) reality, the fun comes in very small, almost untraceable doses, the visuals offer a palette of dark colors that blend the setting with characters and items, and the storyline is neither epic nor stellar. If that doesn't chase you from the game, then the rest of this review most definitely will.The Good:+ The level-up system is actually rather good+ The dialogue will make you laugh--whether it's meant to or notThe Bad:-- Somebody let this game out into the market-- Long sequences of boring combat-- Many people might not even find their way out of the first castleThe Ugly::( The character and monster designsStoryline--1/10Unfortunately the script-writers don't provide the characters with any intelligent dialogue. In fact, it's laughable. The game doesn't take itself very seriously, which makes things even worse. Take for example what the main character, Alaron, says when the party stops to rest. They sit before a campfire and the camera zooms on Alaron's face. He says, ""Ah! Pass the marshmallows."" Not only is this not very funny, but it grows annoying when you have to watch this scene every time your party rests. The best line of dialogue, though, belongs to the knight, Abrecan. When the king sends Alaron on a quest and offers as a reward to make Alaron (who is at the time a squire) a knight, Abrecan objects. He continuously insults his king by saying, ""You are too generous."" And each time he repeats those words, more and more of them become capitalized, expressing Abrecan's abhorrent anger for the king allowing this young squire a chance to become a knight. Compared to that line of dialogue, nothing else is worth remembering.Gameplay--1/10Many of you may not find your way out of the labyrinthine castle you start out in, but for those who do you'll do some questing and searching through the not-so-labyrinthine-but-still-difficult-to-navigate outside areas. Most importantly, you'll be battling bad guys. That's what you bought the game for, right? To battle bad guys? For this, the game developers bumped their heads together and thought, ""What is so fun about video games?"" They made a list, narrowed it down to ""What's so fun about RPGs,"" and then, for the fun of it, made a list of ""What would not be fun in an RPG."" But somebody accidentally slipped this last list to the developers and threw out the other one. Thus the combat that lasts 10 to 20 minutes and consists of lots swinging and missing. I swear, the chance to hit in this game is about as low as the chance to miss in other games. There are so many factors that go against your chance to hit that there just is no hitting. And when you reach a high enough level to actually start hitting the enemies, you move on to the next area where the enemies are stronger and, thus, harder to hit. ARGGHH!!! Back to square one.On the bright side, the experience system is rather good. You can put points into different skills for each character, giving you a lot of freedom for customization. Too bad the rest of the game couldn't have been so fun and original.Longevity--1/10As I said, many of you will probably never leave the castle, where poor Alaron will breathe his last, but for those fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to make it out and go on your quest, there's a lengthy quest here. Much of it consists of long battles between incompetent fighters, and very little of it consists of an engaging story. In the end, it would be much more merciful to allow Alaron to live out the rest of his days lost in the castle.",1,A 1? Now you're too generous!,1371600000,"06 19, 2013"

This could actually be the worst game I've ever played, so that's saying alot.The game tries to be a ""choose your own adventure"" samurai story set in the last days of the Tokugawa Shogunate era of Japan, but completely fails. Here's why:-Even though there are multiple paths you can take through the game, you can beat the game in about 45 min. either way. Not even most 16-bit games are that short, and those are certainly a helluva lot more fun!-The swordfighting is boring, due to the slow pace, lack of moves, and under-evolved fighting engine. And since that's the main gameplay hook, it leaves you with little reason to play. Dynasty Warriors and Devil May Cry both sweep the floor with this one.-There's no voice acting. Just grunting and giggling sound effects. For a game that wants to have a story, this sure is a raw deal...-The save system is just messed up. Period. There were occasions where I'd save my game, die, and find out that my file had  mysteriously been erased. And a quick look at some of the other reviews tell me I'm not alone on this one...-The black guy with the afro. Seriously, what the hell is this guy doing here? Maybe if he actually said something funny once in a while, it'd be pretty neat, but as it is, he has no personality, and seems to just take up space. Leave him alone.-The game world is tiny.

Also, I really like that it tracks how much battery time is left if you open it up, or how much time untill full charge if you open it up while you're plugged in.Charging system - If you keep your computer on all the time this setup is probably ideal for you, as you'll pretty much never have to plug it in while you play, but for those of us who have to charge it occasionally during play, it's got a nice little spindle that you can roll the usb cord out from to make it ""adjustable"", it kind of keeps the cords out of the way a little bit too, and you can plug the wireless receiver into it.Cons -Surround Sound - Sometimes if I turn, on rare occasions the sound becomes very distant. (i.e. I'll be sitting next to a guy talking (an npc in a game), and he'll be talking to me, I'm facing him, he's loud, then I'll turn so he's talking to my right side and it will all of a sudden sound like he's in a fish bowl 100 yards away). You can actually adjust sound for different channels which is great, but it's not consistent so it'd be hard for me to tweak it.Comfort - kind of. These are circumaural, which means they go around your ears, which is what I wanted. When I first put them on they don't feel that comfortable, more neutral, and I kind of have to adjust them a little bit once in a while to stay comfortable. That being said I've kept them on for extended periods of time and pretty much forget about them.Overall very happy with these, I don't know how I would change the comfort as the padding feels comfortable and they pivot/adjust every which way already... I've tested a couple pairs that felt better during short play sessions but since these seem to get comfortable over time I'm not worried about it.edit: 2+years later, boom is broken, both of my buddies booms broke as well, no abuse really...oh well, still works with some duct tape. Sound quality is never an issue, but sometimes the headphones get messed up at the moment I plug it in to charge and won't turn back on unless I restart the whole machine. Voice modification is actually pretty silly, everyone else on the channel will hate you. Wireless is awesome, still holds a good charge after all this time, sound quality is good. I would and probably will buy another pair of these, still 4 stars...probably 4.5 if they allowed half stars.2nd edit: gorilla glued the boom back on and it's good as new!",4,Very happy with this headset.,1289347200,"11 10, 2010"

I was even more upset that I was totally unable to get the chat microphone set up to work with the PS3.  The PS3 refused to recognize the headset base, so I was unable to select it under the Accessory Settings / Audio Device Settings menu option.  I double checked the enclosed instructions and the PDP videos on their website, confirmed the wiring setup was correct, but still couldn't get the mic working.

For listening they work OK, but again I was unable to get the microphone to work at all.In addition to the PS3 and PC troubles I have some other practical issues with the headset:- Ability to adjust color is fun, but there should be a way to adjust the brightness and/or turn off the lighting altogether, because sometimes you don't want the glow.- There should be an option to use the base unit without the large plastic hanger (used to hold the headphones on), but as of now the hanger is non-removable.

It's a handheld title that rivals its console brethren on most levels, namely sound, graphics and content. If you've played an Assassin's Creed game before, this experience is not far different from games in the past and you'll quickly find yourself running, traversing and assassinating enemies with the familiar tools of the trade. For brief sections, this game is a lot of fun and exactly what an Assassin's Creed fan would want from a handheld Assassin's Creed game.Unfortunately, the development team behind Liberation found it necessary to fill the game with Vita-specific gimmicks that aren't intuitive enough or don't work as well as they should in concept. These include tilting and turning the system to complete various puzzles, rubbing two fingers across both touch screens similar to ripping open an envelope and holding the camera up to a light source to reveal mission-specific secrets. These moments will quickly sour your experience because they are light on instructions, tricky to master, and often don't work. With the number of times you'll have to restart sections or redo certain puzzles, you'll begin to question whether this shortcoming is an issue with the Vita's hardware or sloppy tech poorly implemented by Ubisoft. Besides the newly introduced mechanics, Liberation does find itself with the same issues that previous Assassin's Creed games have had as well. The parkour elements of the game (running, climbing, jumping from rooftop to rooftop) are all there in their same glitchy glory and are just as infuriating and frustrating as their console counterparts.In short, there are multiple 5 to 10 minute sections of Liberation that feel great, are quick and responsive and work just like you would expect them to.

After I was sent my first mouse I immediately had the issue of the mouse not allowing the computer to stay in sleep mode. This still has not been fixed and all Razer could do was tell me to reinstall their drivers.  There was also a bubble in the rubber thumb  pad that was extremely irritating and uncomfortable. After about a week the left click began to feel like it was grinding on something, like there was a grain of sand inside the mouse.  This mouse also would randomly disconnect from its wireless base and the only way to fix it was to unplug the base and plug it back in, which only worked anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes at which time I'd have to unplug it again.  Fed up I sent it back and got a new one.The new mouse has the same issue of not allowing the computer to stay in sleep mode for more than 15 minutes.  Not only that but it has serious issues controlling the DPI settings when switching profiles or when Synapse 2.0 is not running. Often times when switching profiles the DPI will be at identical levels but the cursor will slow down for no reason.  If I change the settings even 100 DPI higher or lower and then unplug the base to make the changes take effect the cursor speed skyrockets and unplugging the base only causes the speed to increase further.  I have yet to get it working properly and the lack of Razer forums is a huge hindrance. I'm forced to scour random forums for people with similar issues who often times have had no success.  I read one review on here stating that Razer's quality control had gotten better since this mouse's initial release and that all firmware issues had been taken care off. Complete lie. Razer customer support is of no help. This mouse is unfortunately the only mouse that has a shape, look, and button placement that I like so I will be forced to use this piece of crap mouse and deal with all of it's issues.If you can avoid buying this mouse, do so.EDIT: Got a replacement mouse after the first catastrophe.

Fun to playIt's still fun to play, although it is still the same mindless, hack and slash, quasi-RPG game that the previous two are.2. Decent presentationGraphics and sound (music/sound effects/etc) are pretty solid, if uninspired.3. Isometric viewI am really glad that they did not turn this game into a first person view game, like Bethesda did with Fallout 3.THE BAD=======1. Server ""issues""'Nuff said.  Surprising given that it took Blizzard 12 years to come out with this game.2. Quasi-RPG, with NO CHARACTER BUILDS/CUSTOMIZATION (i.e. LITTLE REPLAY VALUE)Nothing is permanent, including character 'development'.  By choosing to not allow players to increase specific character attributes (dexterity, strenth, etc.), Blizzard really took out the ""quasi"" in ""quasi-RPG"".  It's actually a straight up action game, with skills automatically unlocked automatically based on XP the SAME FOR EVERYONE.  So absolutely ZERO character customizations.  Forget about agonizing over how to develop your character, because Blizzard has decided to dumb it down for you and make everything possible at any time.  Don't like your current skills?  Well, just choose another one, they're all available after all!  Ridiculous decision and quite possibly the worst thing about this game.3. Complete Re-hash of Diablo II (i.e. NOT VERY INTERESTING TO PLAY THE FIRST TIME)This game is basically D2 with updated graphics and worse voice acting and absolutely zero atmostphere.  The maps seem so familiar that you could probably do the entire game from memory even if you have never played it before, as long as you have played D2.  Specifically...4. Lack of Randomized dungeons (i.e. LOW REPLAY VALUE)Everything is in the same location, or so it seems at least.  The continental maps are the same, so everytime you play a game online you join the mad rush of players all running towards destinations like rats who have mastered a maze.  The 'dungeons' (there are actually few dungeons), or locations, all seem to be minimally varied at all game to game.  This makes the game lose a lot of its REPLAY VALUE.  Let's say that this game has very low replay value unless you want to play all the characters through all the difficulty levels and get them all up to level 60 or whatever the highest level is.  No point in ever playing the same class twice, since there is no 'build' anymore for characters.5. Lack of AtmosphereIt really looks like WoW in an isometric view.  Completely gone is the claustrophobic, disturbing, and foreboding atmosphere of D1.  Everything looks cartoonish, which is exacerbated by the veritable fireworks display of all colors everytime you use just about any skill.  Not to mention that many weapons have a neon glow to them even when not in use.  Don't be surprised to see a barbarian running around with bright neon orange and green axes in his hands.  And a coop battle looks like you're at some kind of a rave or Phish concert.6. MiscellaneousBad writing, distracting attempts at humor, very poor voice acting (especially Leah), and tedious intro/cutscenes.OVERALL:========3/5 for mindless fun2/5 for overall quality of the game++********************(UPDATED (5/18/2012)********************So, I finished the game on 'normal' difficulty and got up to level 31 with my Demon Hunter.  Add a few new ""goods"" and ""bads"" for this game...GOOD====1. Better CutscenesThe ones at the end are better than the earlier ones (e.g. it's possible to watch it through without hitting ESC).2. Still Fun (for now...)Yes, it is still fun to play, despite the numerous deficiencies mentioned previously.  Once I finish the game on the hardest difficulty, I cannot imagine playing it again until the inevitable expansion pack(s) comes out.  I will play all the difficulty levels though and the expansion packs, which should say something about the casual playability of this game.  Despite the limitations on and simplification of character development, it is still fun to 'unlock' new skills to use.  Much of the fun does derive from leveling (read: grinding) and item collection (who doesn't still love to collect rare, unique, and now legendary items?).BAD===1. Too SHORT!!! (i.e. LOW REPLAY VALUE)Maybe 15-20 hours and I finished the game in normal difficulty, and I cannot believe how SHORT THIS GAME IS.  It's shocking actually, and it does not help that the acts are so similar to D2.  For some reason I expected this game to be much longer and expansive compared with D2, similar to how D2 was much more immense in scope compared with D1.  But no, there are still just 4 (I think) acts that are fairly short and easy to complete.2. Lame Bosses/Lairs (i.e. Zzzzzz...)Most of the bosses in D3 are pretty lame.  Half of them are just gigantic, bulbous and obese monstrosities that are barely distinguishable from one another.  Only Diablo himself appears significantly unique.  The lairs are similarly boring... most are just gigantic square rooms that you run around endlessly trying to avoid getting injured.  The boss action, of course, is pure 'grinding' at its finest.  In the later acts, the bosses are almost back to back to back, which to be quite honest got tired really fast, especially when they all seemed the same.3. Horrible Skill Interface/System (i.e. FORGET ABOUT SWITCHING THEM IN A BATTLE!)Yes, the way that you switch between skills is very cumbersome and involves opening up a skills window and then clicking on various tabs to select different skills and their runes (which are not physical items either) that was not intuitive at all at the beginning, and even when you get used to it still prevents easy switching of skills.  Fine, let there be a 'cool off' time for switching skills, but requiring the skills window to open up in order to change skills is beyond annoying and really means you're not likely to do it in a battle.  So, that means that essentially you're stuck with a half dozen skills, max, at any given time.  This feels very limited and boring, especially when you have all these skills that you unlocked and would like to use with some variety to keep things fun.4. Linear Gameplay (i.e. GO FROM A > B > C > D...)More so than D1 or even D2, D3 is super linear.  There is very little exploration you can do except for on the world maps, and even then there are blockades that need to be unlocked as part of some quest or another, limited your ability to explore.OVERALL=======It is still a fun game but very disappointing in many ways.  Primarily the lack of character attribute/skill customization (e.g. no 'builds'), the sense of deja vu that you get when you play due to the game being so similar in design to Diablo 2, and the small scope of the game.  I couldn't believe that Diablo came so soon, and when he died I was wondering if there would be another act or something, but alas, it just ended with a whimper and yet another cutscene.3/5 for mindless fun2/5 for overall quality of the game********************(UPDATED (5/20/2012)********************BOTTOM LINE===========So, I got my character up to level 50 and finished D3 on nightmare difficulty and... I just uninstalled it.  The truth is, the more you play, the higher level you achieve, the less you want to continue playing.  This mostly is a result of the lack of character development/customization (and by that, I mean inability to assign attribute points or selectively develop/specialize skills as in D2) and the overall similarity to D2.  The over-simplication (and let's not forget that D2 was a pretty simple game to begin with... hardly real RPG type character development or gameplay) really is the downfall of this otherwise serviceable game.  The bottom line is -- it's just not that fun to play over and over again.  It's also laughable that Blizzard is trying to squeeze even more money out of their fans pockets with the Auction House, which no normal person would (or could) actually use to try to make money off of the game.  I remember selling various items from D2 on ebay (remember the 'grandfather sword' anyone?) but it's hard to imagine that anyone would do the same with this game.In the end, I have to say that while fun for awhile, D3 is ultimately a massive disappointment to fans of the series.  For me, it provided less than a week of gameplay, unlike D2 that I played for months and months.  It is not the kind of Blizzard product that the company built its reputation on during the 1990s and 2000s, and is clearly showing the unfortunate influence of big company marketing in the development of one of its most popular franchises.  Unless the direction that Blizzard takes with their games (e.g. dumbing down and simplifying their games to achieve more widespread appeal) changes, I will NOT be buying another Blizzard product ever.  Thank God for Kickstart, which has brought back the possibility of independent game development back from the dead (Wasteland 2!!!)...Final (downgrade) Rating:2/5 for brief, mindless fun1/5 for overall quality of the game*******************UPDATED (6/1/2012)*******************Yes, I know I said the last update would be the last but I had a few things to add.So, I have the collector's edition (completely worth the $100 given all the goodies it comes with), which includes D2/LOD on a USB flash drive.  After uninstalling D3 (after 6 days of gameplay getting my Demon Hunter up to lvl 50 and finishing on nightmare difficulty), I decided to see how D2 looked and played (haven't played it since 2001, after getting the LOD expansion pack) after all these years.Well, D2/LOD is still great!  I've been playing for about two weeks (more than twice the time I played D3 for), building a Werebear Druid, and I am amazed with the superiority of this game over the follow-up that took 12 years to be released but feels like a cheap imitation of the real deal.MORE BAD THINGS ABOUT DIABLO 3==============================1. HAND-HOLDING AND DUMBED DOWN GAMEPLAY (e.g. D3 NEEDS TO APPEAL TO THE TABLET GAMER CROWD!!)Yes, the geniuses at Blizzard decided that D3 had to be super noob friendly to help ensure the most widespread adoption by casual gamers.  So, LOOT that drops from monsters for each player in a multiplayer game INDIVIDUALLY, which other players cannot see let alone pickup.  I mean, how stupid is that?  It makes no sense for this to happen and is an example of extent of the absurd hand-holding and 'noob-ification' of this game.Another example is the ELIMINATION of the use of TOWN PORTAL or IDENTIFY scrolls.  What a hassle to use those items when Blizzard could just simplify the game to get rid of them, and instead allow players to press a button at any time to magically teleport themselves back to town (complete with a silly animation of the players crouching and white energy balls emanating from their hands), right?  And identify scrolls, a RPG staple from the earliest days, well, why not get rid of that silly hassle too and allow players to identify any item just by right clicking on it?Frustrated by having to explore the square continental MAPS searching for important locations (well, the first time you play through that is, because those locations don't appear to ever change)?  Well, no problem because the good folks at Blizzard have decided that exploration is a waste of time and so they make ARROWS and other indicators appear on the map that SHOW YOU WHERE TO GO, and if you are close to an important place.  Yes D2 act 1 had a road that would lead you to adjacent maps, but nothing even close to this level of hand-holding.  Can anyone really question the noob-ification and extreme linearness of this game?  There's not even an option to turn those map 'hints'/guides off.Yet another example is the noob-ification of the GEAR REPAIR/durability system.  In D3, items have a durability rating (e.g. 24/24) but that never seems to decrease (or at least, very slowly), despite using your weapons and taking damage.  Even if an item does break you can simply get it FIXED by the blacksmith guy, so really what was the point?  In D2 (and other RPGs), you fix your gear so that it doesn't break because typically you can't just weld a broken sword back together again!And of course, don't forget that monsters now drop HEALTH ORBS that raise your life instantly when you walk over them, instead of health potions that needed to be then be consumed in order to get healed.So, yes -- Diablo 3 has been SIMPLIFIED and DUMBED DOWN to the level of an arcade side shooter game.  Hell, it's basically Sonic the Hedgehog with gear grinding!2. ABSURD STORYBy now most Diablo fans have heard about the absurd and cringe-inducing story of D3 (I won't 'spoil' it for those of you who haven't played it yet, but it involves a human and a certain demon mating and producing a very annoying NPC).  D2, on the other hand, had a reasonably interesting and fairly well thought out (if not particularly original) story of the 'Dark Wanderer' (your character from D1), which provides the backdrop for D2.  And don't even get me started on the most ridiculous NPC from the Diablo series, Leah...3. 4-PLAYER CO-OP LIMITEight player co-op games in D2 are great -- too bad you're limited to only four players in D3.  Just stupid.4. OTHER BATTLE.NET ISSUESThe game creation system for multiplayer co-op has also been simplified, in a bad way.  You can't name your games or even play in a game with other players unless you are on the same exact quest.  It's very limiting and substantially decreases the online replay value (which is not very high to begin with, unfortunately).5. SILLY D1 'BOSS' CAMEOYes, you've all heard the rumors/spoilers about the return of a Diablo 1 boss (arguably the most famous and well-liked boss from the Diablo series) in D3.  No, it makes no sense why this character, who was killed in D1, would return (complete with memorable catchphrase), but apparently Blizzard thought this would be some sort of a 'treat' for Diablo fans.  It's not.6. DEMON HUNTER WEARS STILETTO HEELSSeriously?  In hindsight, this probably should have tipped me off as to the quality of the game that I was so eagerly awaiting.CONCLUSION==========Don't believe all those 'expert' reviews on the internet, like the mindboggling 100% rating (!!) from Joystiq.  These online blogs are hardly objective to any degree, due to direct advertising revenue they receive from game companies and/or other perks they may receive (e.g. being invited to Blizzard headquarters for exclusive sneak peaks, etc.) that unduly influences their game reviews.  In light of this, it is unsurprising that there are so many highly favorable reviews for D3.This does not obscure the fact that Diablo 3 is simply a mediocre game.  Actually, it's below average.  It gets a 1 star rating from me because of how much worse of a game in many ways (gameplay, battle.net, etc.) it is than its predecessor, the great Diablo 2 despite how long it took (12 years, holy smokes!) to finally come out, and because of Blizzard's thinly veiled primary objective of squeezing as much money out of players with the Real Money Auction House -- a feature that detracts from the item finding fun of the game to a significant degree.Bottom line?  Diablo 3 is fun to play... for a few days.  The problem is that it lacks much of the substance which made Diablo 2, and even Diablo 1, so much more engaging to play... and play again and again.  Perhaps the most accurate description is that D3 is an uninventive and unoriginal reworking of a great game, with deal-breaking noob-ification and over simplifaction of gameplay dynamics and online play.  I would recommend waiting for the inevitable, and likely imminent, price drop before picking this one up.",1,Fun but rehash of Diablo 2,1337212800,"05 17, 2012"
9707,29803,A2YAABMT80RLYA,B0000696CZ,Ben Rowland,"[1, 1]","I avoided writing a 5 star review of this game 6 months before it came out, and considering the bulk of reviews here, it was a smart move. ""Grand Theft Auto: Vice City"" is an excellent game, a worthy follow-up to part 3. Though the graphics and control are almost identical to GTA3, the game has a totally different feel to it. Players who played GTA3 to death will notice this right away.Vice City is a totally different setting, with sun, sand, palm trees, with girls in bikinis walking the streets. Size wise, it is about twice the size of all of Liberty City put together, with more back alleys, shops, slums, and most noticeably, more diverse pedestrians. The same freedom of movement in GTA3 is found here, but in order to give players an incentive to do the missions, certain actions are restricted until they are ""unlocked"" by missions. Certain weapons cannot be attained, some properties cannot be purchased, and so on. And similar to GTA3, sections of Vice City are closed off from the beginning, and can only be unlocked by completing X amount of missions.GTAVC is, like the installment before it, a story-driven crime simulator. But the story here is much deeper and more complex. The main character, Tommy, has a personality and a voice, unlike the mute killer from GTA3. The missions themselves are a lot more complex, and require more skill and timing. From the beginning, you know that you are doing more than courier missions.  But between missions, it's your ball game. The game has 32 weapons at your disposal, but the system for carrying them is ""class-based"", which means that you can only hold one weapon of each kind at a time. For example, if you have the chainsaw but also want the Kitana, you must drop the chainsaw in order to pick the kitana up. In total, you can carry up to 10 weapons at a time. This makes things a bit more difficult, and a bit annoying at times when you run out of bullets, but it is a nice twist.The graphics have been tweaked in areas, with better looking cars and more fluid character animation. The music is one of the best parts of GTAVC, with over 9 hours of licensed 80's tunes on 10 different radio stations. Sometimes, I just like to park and listened to music. Another addition I love is the addition of motorcycles, which handle much better than cars, and are much faster. The drawback there is that crashing it means enduring bodily damage. A few lingering problems with GTA3 have also been fixed, including the addition of an in-game map and the locations of the Amu-nation have been added to the on-screen map.Calling GTAVC is retread of it's predecessor is unfair, since the is much more complex and challenging. In GTA3. You made money performing various missions, and moved from island to island, and cause mayhem, that's it. In GTAVC you can shop, rob stores, buy real estate, do the odd jobs (now including pizza delivery) and find the usual hidden packages and rampages. Overall, anyone who liked GTA3 will love GTAVC.

It is very similar to the standard GameCube controllers, with the addition of a small platform on the bottom & a battery pack for the two (included) AA batteries...none of which is really noticeable during gameplay.The control is precise...I have noticed no lag, nor has the control ever been interrupted due to it pointing the wrong direction or something coming between it and the system.  In fact, we tested it for range, and I was able to work the control from my back yard, with the door closed...a range of somewhere around 60-70 feet!!!  No, most people aren't going to be using it from this far away, but it is nice to know the radio signal is that strong.  You can rest assured that your signal won't be cut off at a crucial moment in your game.Being a user who frequently utilizes all four controller ports, this is wonderful.  We continually get cords tangled, or the dog runs by & knocks one out...with this controller, all there is is the controller itself and a small receiver that plugs into the Gamecube.  The receiver can be attuned to several different frequencies, so you can indeed use four of these at once without encountering interference.The Wave Bird controller is a fantastic value...after the recent price drop, I was pondering buying a couple more standard Nintendo controllers to replace the third party controllers I have, but not any more...it is completely worth the extra money to pick up one of these instead.",5,Wireless done to perfection,1026691200,"07 15, 2002"

Collins,"[1, 1]","I'll try to keep this short and give an honest opinion of the game, mostly glitches aside...Personally I loved Fallout 3 and if you did too, you need to buy this.  That's just a fact.  Many of the glitches have been fixed and thanks to autosaves and the ability to save anywhere at anytime, you shouldn't lose a lot of time if you run into a glitch.  (Note: The cowboy hat glitch is avoidable if you do not complete one of the missions...you should be able to google more info on that situation as I did.)PROS:1) Same wonderful Fallout gameplay2) 100+ hours of story and side quests3) At least three different stories to follow, maybe 4+ as I haven't completed them all yet4) Decisions dramatically impact the actions and opinions of those around you.  Some decisions will make possible companions into enemies and vice versa.5) Achievements are well implemented (XBOX 360 atleast)6) Some new options like Hardcore mode (with real-time healing not instant, etc.) and ability to piece together ammo from old shells/casings were nice add-ons.7) Mini-gambling games are a lot of fun.  Only includes blackjack, roulette, and slots (and a mini-card game called Caravan) but I spent a lot of time in the casinos.CONS:1) Glitches, I can forgive, but not game-breaking, objective-blocking, consistent Xbox-freezing glitches.2) Locations seemed much less creative and varied.  You are either in the Mojave desert or Vegas.  Not much in between, and Vegas isn't very big.  Much less creative than the Capital Wasteland.3) New Vegas could have been much more interesting and impressive, but breaking it down into 3 or 4 separate locations that load between each one really kills any sense of awe.4) My favorite gun has always been the combat shotgun and it appears to not be in the game.5) VATS is still there and a ton of fun, but some of the camera angles felt bad and less satisfying.6) Hardcore mode is VERY hard due to a) companions being virtually useless and dying quickly, leading to failing undiscovered missions, and b) limbs can't be healed using stimpaks so be prepared to play large chunks of the game with an injured head and the screen blurring...not fun.7) A lot of the new additions like the storyline, the quests, and people you meet are generally forgettable, boring, easy to accomplish or disappointing.  Sad to say but a lot of the quests involved going from point A to point B and talking to someone.Overall, if you liked Fallout 3, you need to get this, but don't expect to be blown away.  There was a sense of discovering the world as the characters was discovering it in Fallout 3, but here you are playing as a character that is already somewhat familiar with the world...just as we are with the Fallout 3 engine.  Not much inspiration, but it makes up for some of that lack of inspiration with the ability to direct the future of New Vegas.  Its definitely more content than an expansion, but as a full-on sequel I was a little disappointed and can only give it a 4/5.",4,Game Review: Glitz & Glitches,1292198400,"12 13, 2010"

Some fighters are made for speed (Ayane & Jann Lee), others are made for brutality (Bayman), others are meant to throw around the compeition (Tina & Bass) and some are meant to just be unique (Hayabusa & Brad Wong).I am sure that we can all see that the graphics in this game are some of the best of the X-Box and that is saying alot. There are amazing 17 character models, detailed things like flowing fabrics and whipping hair (yet forgotten things like shadows).The story takes a back seat and the fighting flows with four major buttons. Punch, kick, throw and block. By ""flows"" I mean when you attack, strike, kick or punch, your character does not always return to face your opponent, which sets it up for something different, like a roundhouse kick leaves your character with his or her back to the opponent, then you can have a series of other moves, like an elbow, another roundhouse, a different throw or by pressing forward it turns your fighter around. Basically it creates different and interesting dynamics.There are not just traditional standing fighters, grapplers and submission fighters, but there are fighters like Brad Wong and Hyabusa that have far different techniques. Hayabusa can stand on his hands and fight with his feet, Brad Wong has a drunken sort of fighting that makes him very difficult to grapple and throw.The game modes are : Story Mode, Time Attack Mode, Versus Mode, Survival Mode, Tag Battle Mode, Team Battle Mode, Sparring Mode and Watch Mode.Even with the great fighting system and fantastic visuals, it still feels like the game is missing something. Its an arcade fighter, so each fighter has his or her own ending video. Not the most spectacular video, spectacular looking yes, but interesting, no. There are no unlockables except for an extra costume or two for all of the fighters. Everything is already unlocked, except the endings.

well, it's hard to know if you can give the developer credit for work that the player has done, especially when their one preset scheme is mostly borrowed from another game. regardless, fully customizable remote options have become standard in every wii shooter since, making the conduit a watershed FPS in that regard. however, the customization still leaves a little to be desired; locking on does not stop turning on the Y axis, which defeats the purpose of locking on (stabilizing the camera) in the first place. vertical motion in general feels awkwardly sensitive and jittery, with your weapon constantly bobbing up and down with the smallest of movements while the horizontal plain remains steady.adjust all the settings you want, there is no effective way to address this and make the vertical turning feel good. put in a copy of the metroid trilogy, set it to advanced and everything feels right again; the conduit may have the edge when it comes to the range of adjustments but the overall feel is simply not as natural, hammering home the lesson that customization can only do so much without a solid developer based scheme to build off of. that said, the controls can still be tweaked for a great, if not perfect, scheme.-the conduit was developed with a new engine built specifically for wii in order to utilize every bit of power at the system's disposal, a wasted effort in retrospect considering that the conduit is one of the most bland and generic games seen this generation. the weapon models are well done with impressive lighting and texture effects, but nearly everything else looks like it's pulled from an n64 game; the blocky, polygonal, drab environments unintentionally hearken back to goldeneye in ways that don't inspire nostalgia.from sewers to subways to underground bunkers to above ground bunkers, nearly every setting is beyond cliche at this point and yet the conduit manages to make them feel more generic than ever before... walking through the streets of D.C., you'll see storefronts with beige panels where the windows should be, with only a humble neon sign reading ""restaurant"" or ""bar"" to separate one from another. some of the environments are so pathetically uninspired that it's hard to believe this game is running on the same system as metroid corruption, a game with more going on in the background of it's most mundane environments than the conduit has front and center in it's best levels. if it sounds unfair to compare the work of a small developer to a 1st party one, well, high voltage kind of asked to be held to that standard when they un-humbly boasted it would be the wii's best looking game.it's not just the total lack of art direction that makes the levels boring- the layouts themselves are so linear and repetitive that you'll frequently feel like quitting before the halfway point. every level is a series of beige hallways with only the most basic scattering of crates for detail- this was the state of level design in the late 90's for a reason, being that it was all the limited horsepower of the time would allow. high voltage has no such excuse for the emptiness of their level designs; they simply didn't put much effort in (a fact they've tacitly admitted to with their promise to pay attention to art direction and design in the sequel). there are brief moments where the game lets you out of the hallways and tunnels and actually gives you something interesting to look at, but even then it feels like the game is just managing to look ""adequate"".--thankfully the weapons arsenal is fairly diverse and features some creative designs (albeit ones that borrow a little too heavily from perfect dark); you'll be able to find at least one or two guns that will become favorites. some effort has been made to utilize the abilities of the wii remote in firing, such as twisting the remote sideways to activate an alternate fire mode or even directing missiles with the cursor after they've been fired, innovative little twists that are fun to use and work well.for the entire first half of the game you'll generally be facing two different kinds of enemies with those weapons, guys in suits and guys in armor. then, once alien enemies are introduced, it's once again mostly down to two flavors; big ones that shoot at you and annoying little ones that claw at your legs. while fighting is satisfying early on, it begins to feel a bit like a chore to take down the same enemies again and again in levels where enemies respawn endlessly (which there are a lot of). the game features almost no bosses or special enemies to break up the monotony, with most levels ending by simply giving you a few extra guards to fight before fizzling out. it could have been worse, but high voltage certainly didn't deliver much dynamism in the combat department.--if the single player isn't much of a draw, how about the online mulitplayer? shooting real human players with decent guns and precise controls... it's hard to screw up, isn't it? let me describe a typical online encounter in the conduit- you approach another player and empty round after round into their head with no effect. you get the point where you run out of bullets and get shot to death by your opponent while trying to reload; is he hacking? is the game really that slow that it hasn't processed your shots yet? you won't know for another 5-10 seconds, when you'll either see a skull icon appear on screen (indicating that you did in fact kill him at some point during the fight), or see nothing at all (confirming that he was in fact cheating).the laggy nature of the game removes the ""winning"" part of the equation from winning a fight. you'll often deliver the fatal blow to your opponent only for them to continue shooting you during the several seconds (sometimes minutes) it takes before the game recognizes them as 'dead', often making it impossible for either player to come out alive. the lag is the least of the online problems, with invincible hackers firing rocket launchers like machine guns in nearly every match and a heinous spawn glitch that often makes it impossible to even play at all; after setting up the match and waiting 5 minutes to connect with other players, you'll frequently find yourself staring at a glitched screen, unable to move or even return to the wii menu to reboot the game. this once happened to me 5 times in a row, costing over half an hour of time without a single second of gameplay. the silver lining is that the online mode is very fun when it works, with great guns, challenging enemies and a couple of fair maps to shoot them in... the key part of that sentence is ""when it works"".---the single player campaign is bland to the point of unplayable. the online mode rarely connects successfully, keeps up to speed or is free of hackers. all in all, the conduit is a pretty poor excuse for a game. it may sound like i'm being harsh, but no game with this amount of bugs and glitches should have been allowed to reach shelves, and for that reason part of me feels like it could deserve an even lower score. however, the game does stand as having contributed something to this generation of shooters with it's in depth customization scheme, the online multiplayer can be great fun when all the planets align for you and your match actually functions, and the game does deserve credit for taking it's own approach and not using the ""call of duty/battlefield/medal of honor/halo"" mold for it's gameplay, leaving the game with enough redeeming qualities to keep it from being a total disaster.are those redeeming qualities enough to still justify buying this game now that better FPS like red steel 2, goldeneye, numerous call of duty ports, and even high voltage's follow up, conduit 2, are becoming available? in my opinion the answer is no, absolutely not. pass on it, and pass on it hard.",3,mediocre to the core,1286928000,"10 13, 2010"

It perfected the genre of Survival Horror and created a cult following immediately. Even today it is one of the most successful franchises in game history and definitely a large part of the bread and butter at CAPCOM. However it did not achieve this status for nothing. With every CLASSIC game there is a special and carefully developed gameplay system. The Resident Evil series from the beginning was developed with exploration and puzzle solving in mind. Then the graphical presentation was developed to supply enough detail and interest that a person would actually want to explore it. The setting, in a mansion full of horror story influences, was perfect for the type of game style that was being developed. At the time they used static backgrounds due to the fact that the Sony Playstation system couldn't display enough polygons to make a believable environment. But doing it this way also proved to make the graphical presentation much smoother and more detail rich. Later the series would try full 3D in Code Veronica for Sega Dreamcast, and then return to it's roots on GameCube in perhaps the best looking game to date. Resident Evil Gaiden for GBC was perhaps an unrealistic attempt from the beginning. The gameplay has completely changed so dramatically that it becomes a new game with a Resident Evil logo. It resembles more of a Metal Gear 8-bit Nintendo game from the 80's than a Resident Evil game. The battle system is completely boring and overly hard. It is more like a game of golf because you have to hit the button at the right time on a progress bar that scrolls left to right before you can shoot a zombie in combat mode. It's tricky and timing is everything. But, more importantly it just doesn't fit the RE universe and it is a poor attempt to port a name over to a dead handheld system with way too little power for such a detail/exploration latent game as RE. The graphics are horrible even for GBC standards and the battle system is poorly developed and there is no since this is even a RE game at all. Invest in something else, anything else. For 20 bucks more you could have RE for GameCube, the best RE there is. Stay away from this game I promise you will be taking it back the next day to trade for something else.

If you see it almost being given away, you may find it to be ok, but if you paid too much, it will seem to be a rip off.The game is hosted by a 3D polygon of Jeff Foxworthy, he explains the rules, but you can hit any button to skip it. You then chose 1 of the 5 fifth graders as you would on that show, before you start the questions.That part can be annoying, as there is only 5 to choose from, and you can't skip there intro of names, and that part can become very annoying.Then, you get to chose your category, English, astronomy, music... whatever... at least the category switch around and can be different with each new game.However, some of the questions do repeat themselves too much, and there has been a few people report wrong answers to questions programed into the game, but I am yet to see one I know for sure is wrong. Someone reported a question, ""how many days of the week start with T and S"" and say it's 4, but the question I saw in the game was ""how many DON'T start with T & S"" which is 3, which is the right answer, so maybe they have a bugged version, or aren't on a 5th graders reading level of the question.The degree of difficulty is completely random. It is not like ""Who wants to be a millionaire"" where you start off easy, and advance up harder as you go. This one is completely random to where you could have the first few questions hard as hell, then the half a million dollar question could be as easy as ""1 +1 =?""However, if you do make it to the very last question, they can be as hard as hell. Even those who cheat and look up the answers online can still not find the answer to them. First time I got there it was some question about what tribe of Indians didn't join forces or something, and you don't get multiple choice, you have to type in letter by letter the correct word with no hints... so, good luck getting that question right.Apart from that, the game is ok for a while. But once you make it to the million dollar question, you most likely have played it enough times to have pretty much memorized all the answers to questions, and it has lost it's replay value for now.What it needs is some sort of alternate version on the game, or even just mini games, ya know, something like a side game to see how many out of 10, or out of 50, maybe even 100 questions you can answer correctly... things like that, or a mini game to test your knowledge of a certain topic, things like that might keep people coming back for more, but with nothing like that on here, the game does lose it's replay value with nothing more to keep you coming back and playing again.",3,"ok for a while, but loses it's replay value.",1243641600,"05 30, 2009"

I want all Mario Party fans to know that this game is NOT like Mario Party. There is only one board that vaguely resembles a Mario Party board and it is a cheap imitation. The goal of this board is to make it up to the mountain. It's pretty much straight forward with no alternate routes. At certain points you have to roll a certain number in order to progress. When you reach the top of the mountain, you must roll a 6 or higher to win the game. Too much is left up to chance in this game. There is another board that looks like a globe. You have to travel to a specific country and purchase a souvenir photo. The first person to obtain 3 photos wins. This board is better than the other but not worth the price tag of this game. There are other party modes like two player mix and match and 4 party house mode that involves things like hiding the wii remote and locating it based on sound. I like the two player mode best. This mode requires two people to work together on a mini game. You also have to answer questions based on how you think your partner will answer. It's fun but again, not worth the price. This is the first video game I have ever purchased that I have not been satisfied with. I am currently in the process of trading it in via the amazon.com trade-in program.

Each time I walk away from these games with a little bit of dissatisfaction. I'm no stranger to RPGs, having been playing since the original Bard's Tale on the Commodore 64, but over the years, nothing can beat the Might & Magic series. Now, considering the raves this particular game received, if I haven't pissed you off already, read on :)The gameworld is awesome. It's huge. You can find all sorts of stuff to do, and the plot is fairly open-ended. Those are trademarks of TES games.Graphics are well-done. The music is OK, and sound effects are nice, especially in stereo.There is a However.Combat sucks. It seems to be grossly hack-n-slash. I normally like those kinda games, but the combat system here is just pitiful. Madly clicking on the mouse while trying to keep the enemy in target, all in game-time. No turn-by-turn. No real time to develop strat once the combat begins.Inventory management is cumbersome. Click here, click there. It's easy to manage, but there are seemingly no keyboard shortcuts, everything is purely mouse-driven.Skills are use-based improvements. As you use any skill, you'll eventually imp. So if you spend 15 minutes selling a worthless item, and buying it back, you'll imp up the necessary mercantile skills. Same for communication, just spend 30 minutes admiring someone. Such systems are easily exploitable. Search the web for a 14-minute TES:Morrowind solution.NPC intereaction is distance-triggered. If within a few feet of almost any NPC, you'll trigger their dialogue and they'll start talking to you. It can get annoying.Quest management is non-existant. To review your quests, open or closed, you need to open a journal which stores events in chronological order, and page back and forth between entries. A lot of gamers often receive quests which are too high for them at the moment, move on to gain levels, and return later on. By this time, you've got several journal entries cluttering things up, so you need to thumb around the journal to find them.There is no way to keep in-game notes, so if I get a quest which involves 5 NPC's, I need to physically write down their on a notepad.They (BethSoft) also have some strange engine which gives me motionsickness after a few minutes.

10406,12043,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00004U1R1,B. E Jackson,"[1, 3]","Let me ask you a question.  When playing A Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time, do you think Kakariko Village is the most important part of the game?  Do you think meeting everyone in town, getting to know their personalities, and figuring out their dilemmas is the most exciting part of the quest?  Then Majora's Mask is for you.  Me?  I think meeting people in Zelda games should only be one of *several* fun things a player can do.  There's also exploring rich and colorful overworlds, fighting enemies and bosses with specific weapons and strategies, collecting exciting items that take advantage of the heroic Zelda theme, and exploring dangerous and challenging dungeons filled with traps and aggressive enemies around every corner.  When you add up all these crucial features that I've grown to associate with the Zelda series, it officially makes a Zelda adventure feel like a complete package.  So what happens when you take away most of these trademark features of Zelda?  You're left with an incomplete, unsatisfying boring game.  Proof that storytelling and character development can only provide entertainment for so long.  This is why Majora's Mask isn't very good.Majora's Mask does tell a remarkable story and has pretty decent characters.  There's no Ganon as the bad guy but I don't really mind.  He's been used too many times anyway.  Many of the characters from Ocarina of Time even return for another appearance, such as the music box guy, the horse owner and the Goron's.  Their specific theme songs from Ocarina of Time can be heard as well.  The story is that Link takes a walk into the woods after the events of Ocarina of Time, and a mischievous imp named Skull Kid supporting two naive fairies turns evil upon wearing a mask.  This imp is especially a big jerk- not only does he want Link to die, he wants him to suffer as well. Why?  Because he's wearing the Majora's Mask, a mask with mysterious powers.  This Skull Kid guy is now completely out of control and Link is apparently the only one who can stop him.  Sound appealing to you?  It is.  Too bad the gameplay is so one-dimensional with all the errand running concerning the townspeople.  Oh but there's another aspect to the story- the moon above is angry and if Link isn't able to finish the quest in under 72 hours and stop Skull Kid's madness, the moon will crash into the planet and everyone will die.  An enticing and noticeably darker theme for a Zelda game.  The moon totally reminds me of the angry sun from Super Mario Bros. 3.  Just *look* at his face, haha.Instead of Kakariko Village you have Clock Town.  No it's not a town dominated by clocks; it's a perfectly normal looking town with buildings and ordinary people running around, many of which aren't the least bit concerned that the world is coming to an end which is quite a peculiar reaction if I do say so.  Throughout this town you perform tedious tasks such as finding children in a hide and seek game, and a needlessly generic rupee collecting mission that involves floating around on pink Deku flowers and landing safely on generic platforms.  Clock Town itself is divided into four basic areas.  North, South, West and East.  You'll be *constantly* running back and forth between these four areas over and over again figuring out the mediocre tasks relating to the townspeople.  The theme song that you hear in Clock Town is cute enough to make you puke!  Reminds me of the Muppet Babies, seriously.Unfortunately the repulsive baby-like and overdone ocarina-playing segments are back one again where you have to play songs by way of pressing a sequence of buttons.  This is comparable to a 3-year old kid pressing buttons on a toy and believing he's making great music.  I HATE this aspect of the 3D Zelda series so much.  You'll be playing the Song of Time hundreds of times since the idea is that you have to go back to a previous time whenever the moon above gets a little too close for comfort and you're in danger of running out of time.  The good news is that going back to a previous time means you can re-collect rupees and other things (where you can repeatedly deposit rupees by way of a banker in West Clock Town, allowing you to run around collecting a bunch of rupees and simply return to this same spot over and over as a way to keep them stored).  The bad news?  Going back in time is often inconvenient since you JUST spent several minutes trying to advance the plot (and probably desperately hoping the game offers something more than going around talking to people) so this whole ""going back in time"" portion of the gameplay gets pretty annoying after a while.  A Link to the Past allows Link to transport to a dark ""mirror"" world and Ocarina of Time uses time travel- these concepts are both a lot better than repeatedly going over the same areas and rooms and opening the same chests that only serve as a pitiful attempt to drag out the length of Majora's Mask.Eventually you leave Clock Town (thank GOD) and venture out to a smaller, barren and plain-looking overworld with empty fields, scarce and badly animated enemies, and just a totally uninteresting and failed attempt at exploration.  The game has an enormous amount of heart container pieces.  WAY too many in fact.  You get to wear a variety of masks, some of them necessary to make progress, other masks for entertainment value.  Either way, putting on a variety of masks so you can complete tasks and errands hardly satisfies that urge to finish the game, and due to the plethora of problems I've already mentioned, this isn't enough to make me feel like I'm taking on a legitimate Zelda adventure.  I guess that's the point since technically Majora's Mask is a subplot anyway.Soon you arrive to a swamp where a dumb but admittedly funny story pertaining to a tied up monkey accused of kidnapping a princess takes place.  The story is the *only* good portion of this swamp/Deku Palace I'm afraid.  From here you have a boring stealth mission avoiding being caught, boring lily pad jumps, platform gliding by way of a Deku Flower item which is really childish, and overall tacky combat so the storyline can take center stage.  My God is it ever torturous killing enemies with bubbles (yes that's right, BUBBLES!) in this one underground portion.  You have to eliminate 30 enemies and collect the prize they leave behind- gold skulltula tokens for the Mask of Truth (or a Giant Wallet later on).Of course the second biggest problem with the game (besides focusing on story and characters and nothing else) is that the dungeons are limited to only four, and half of them aren't what I'd call particularly long or memorable either.  The Woodfall Temple is surprisingly short and uninspiring.  It's all about torch-lighting puzzles, collecting stray fairies which is a mandatory mini quest I guess you can say probably used as a means to make the dungeons feel longer then they really are, running across narrow wooden platforms, floating around on your pink Deku flower (and by the way, Link looks horrific wearing the Deku mask) and an uncreative sword-swinging boss fight at the end.  This place falls short of being interesting.  Snowhead Temple is one of the better dungeons.  You have to roll, punch or pound your way through the snow and ice wearing the Goron Mask which alters Link's moves completely.  You have to collect more stray fairies and shoot patches of ice with fire arrows.  The fast-paced boss fight is pretty fun at least, but the Wizzrobe mini battles are sort of annoying.  He teleports all over the room and you have, I'm afraid, *two* battles with him.Great Bay Temple focuses around lighting torches, pulling switches/platform jumps, swimming around (or having the current push Link) and figuring out which room you're supposed to go through all the while being underwater.  This is actually the best temple in the game.  It's challenging in a way that makes you think without being annoying which instantly makes it leagues better than Ocarina of Time's horrendous water dungeon which was nothing more than a snoozefest.  Graphically it looks really good too.  The mini boss is the same as the boss from the water dungeon in Link to the Past but in a 3D world of course.  The fish boss fight is pretty difficult but fast and fun too.  Excellent dungeon overall.  Now the Stone Tower Temple is a major disappointment in comparison.  It's all about statue and switch puzzles, walking statue enemies, underwater swimming with a commendable amount of enemies and threats (in the water at least, nowhere else) and having to reflect light to open doors.  The boss made of bats is original and awesome in appearance.  The main boss fight is the same exact thing as Lanmolas, the sand worms/snakes from the desert palace in Link to the Past.  This is pretty easy for a boss fight too.  Overall however, Stone Tower is incredibly bland and a chore to go through.The final showdown with the gigantic Majora's Mask is cool and ominous in appearance, but lousy in strategy and execution.  You basically spend your entire time dodging whips slapping around the room as well as fire attacks, and basically the object is to use arrows and swords to bring him down.  Whichever incarnation you're facing, a well-equipped Link assures this battle simply isn't challenging enough.  The ending is meaningless too.  I can't remember ever finishing a game and feeling like I just wasted my time.  The fairies are boring and don't really seem interested or grateful for anything you've done.  Neither does Skull Kid or anybody else.  This just goes to show how unmemorable Majora's Mask is overall. Interesting note- the Astral Observatory opens with a couple notes that totally sounds like the intro to Billy Joel's ""Captain Jack"" classic, a song some of you may know.  Some of the mini games are really fun I admit.  The target/bow and arrow games are fun, especially the one where you actually shoot enemies.  I really hate the fact Big Skulltula returns, perhaps the most overrated enemy in the entire Zelda series.I'm not sure if this should be named the worst Zelda game of all-time.  Zelda II: The Adventure of Link for the NES may in fact be worse due to an awkwardly implemented way of battling enemies in side-scroller fashion with bad play control and a REALLY bland overworld.  That game is probably worse than Majora's Mask but only by a tiny notch.  Other things that annoy me is the password-demanding kid in Clock Town, the lovey dovey man and woman in the mini game room, and *especially* the marching rooster collecting game that obviously seems designed for little babies as evident by the nursery rhyme music that plays while performing this horrendous game.  Watching Link march around to this music is just sad on so many levels.  The twin dancers in Clock Town perfecting their moves to Egyptian music resulting in Link performing some rather hilarious and bizarre moves of his own is a nice moment of comedy.  I'm not too crazy about the platform flowers that rise after you water them.  A nifty way to get around perhaps, but rather clumsy in design overall.  Pick up the other 3D Zelda's instead of Majora's Mask and you probably will be happy you did.",2,"don't hide under that mask, Link",1375574400,"08 4, 2013"

Final Fantasy V did a better job of AP distribution.

E Jackson,"[3, 3]","Spyro the Dragon: the game that SHOULD have been Sony's mascot instead of Crash Bandicoot.The original Spyro the Dragon is probably the best platform/adventure game you can find for the Playstation.  I can't give Spyro's first adventure a 5-star rating, though.  Let's get the problems out of the way before moving on to the positive things about Spyro (and believe me, there's a LOT of good things about this game).People have compared Spyro the Dragon to everything from Crash Bandicoot to Banjo-Kazooie to Nights, and... who knows what else.  Well, I think the first Spyro game is JUST as good as all those games.  In fact, Spyro the Dragon is better than the first Crash Bandicoot game.  Now THERE'S a game that disappointed me.  Spyro came out of nowhere and RULED right from the beginning.  I never would have guessed back in 1998 that Spyro would have went on to become a classic.Spyro's debut does have a few problems, though.  Seeing as how this is Spyro's very first adventure I won't be TOO harsh.  Am I the only one who thinks the play control could have been better?  It's not that I have a tough time controlling Spyro.  Well, to be honest, I DID have trouble controlling him at first.  Spyro doesn't QUITE take off when you hit up, down, left or right on the directional pad.  There's a split second delay before moving forward.  Maybe the creators of the game thought this was part of the realism since, after all, you're moving a DRAGON.  A BIG creature like a dragon won't move forward right away.  Then again, Spyro is small compared to the dragons you have to rescue.Controlling Spyro was definitely a problem for me at first.  For example, attempting to properly jump on top of the three round platforms you encounter at the very beginning of the first world was NOT an easy task.  I kept sliding off.  By the way, I recommend you take advantage of these round platforms to get to know the controller.  Master the controller before exploring the world.  This will cut down on any possible frustration you may encounter in the future.I have to consider that my inability to control Spyro may have been due to the camera angles.  Even though the camera in this game is *drastically* better than many other games, you have to admit it isn't flawless either.  If you hit Pause and go to the options, you will see an option for a second camera view called ""active"".  This view is better because the camera immediately follows behind Spyro at ALL times.  The other (default) camera view is more of a hassle trying to figure out where you're moving, and you can't get a good view of what lies ahead.  You may want to change it to ""active"" if the other camera view is difficult for you.  Thank goodness for this option!Some people have a problem with the lack of challenge.  While it's completely true you won't have much trouble making it to the end of any stage in the game, prepare to die 4 or 5 times in each stage before you understand exactly what you have to do, and where you have to jump.  I think the most challenging thing about Spyro the Dragon are the times you have to jump onto a far-away platform, and many times you just BARELY make it.  Many times you will fall to your death.  Be patient, though.  The game NEVER messes with you by throwing in any impossible jumps.  Sometimes it's about finding *just* the right spot to jump and glide, and if you're off just a *little bit* you won't make it.  The creators of Spyro are smart not to make the game frustrating, seeing as how it's supposed to be a game for the entire family.  Good work.The biggest challenge comes at the very end of the game when you face the main boss.  He's really easy to beat, however, GETTING to him is a whole other story.  You see, right at the very end before you face him, you have to jump over a series of disappearing platforms and if you fall (and you WILL fall the first few times because it's hard) you will land in burning lava and have to do the whole stage over again.  Not that the stage is really that long anyway, but this is by FAR the hardest part of the game.  The other 99% of the game only offers a slight challenge here and there.With that said, don't be fooled into thinking the game will be a cakewalk because of all the easy obstacles found throughout World One.  It DOES get harder.  You see, many of the enemies you face in the later levels can only be defeated by either smacking them with your head, or shooting fire at them.  You won't know which of these tricks will be most effective on them until you face the enemy and experiment.  You also have to dodge fireballs, sword-swipes, dogs jumping at you, and tons of other enemy attacks WHILE you try to find the best way to defeat them.  So it's not pathetically easy after all.A minor complaint is that sometimes while you're walking or running, the path will suddenly end, and you'll fall to your death.  Doesn't happen often, but I thought it would be worth mentioning.I hate the way Spyro talks.  He sounds like a bratty teenage rebel with a nasally voice.  Not exactly what a dragons voice should sound like.  Also, when you rescue the dragons, sometimes they say important things you might want to pay attention to.  The problem here is that many times the important tips they say aren't really helpful because they say them right AFTER you've already had to do them!  For instance, in one case after you glide to a far-away platform and rescue a dragon, the dragon will tell you how to glide.  Obviously, since I needed to glide in order to rescue him, I already KNOW how to glide!  So I didn't NEED his help!  This happens a few times during the game.  You just want to scream ""Thanks for nothing, bonehead!""The music was done by a member of the rock band the Police, Stewart Copeland.  People may not realize it, but certain themes in Spyro the Dragon are *very* close to some of the songs that made the Police such a legendary rock band.  Stewart Copeland may have intentionally created the music in this game to match that of the Police, specifically the songs ""walking on the moon"" and ""message in a bottle"".  You'll soon realize that the same guy who created the music in this game also played a big part in creating those Police songs.  The music in Spyro the Dragon is also very catchy and appropriate for the level you're in.  No complaints.  The music is fantastic.I think the creators made a mistake.  When you hit L2 the camera rotates clockwise, and R2 makes the camera rotate counter-clockwise.  It should be the other way around.  Another thing that needs reversed: the way Spyro flies in the bonus stages.  When you press up, you fly down.  When you press down, you fly up!  Strange mistake.  This makes it harder to complete the flying stages, however, you don't have to finish them.In fact, despite what people may tell you, you do *not* have to collect ALL the gems and ALL the dragons.  Finding and collecting all the gems and dragons will only give you a better percentage and open up a bonus stage at the end of the game.  The gameplay in Spyro the Dragon can actually be compared to Yoshi's Island- you don't have to find everything, but doing so will open up rewards and give you an overall better score.  The creators did a fantastic job hiding gems and dragons, increasing the challenge.  More often than not you will see a treasure chest or a dragon statue up high on a platform and not have a single clue how to reach it.  It's fun to run around and think about how to reach it.  Some of them are cleverly located.  One word to describe it- *awesome*Anyway, Spyro the Dragon is tons of fun and may possibly remind you of a 3D Donkey Kong Country, what with TNT barrels and the jungle levels you encounter later on.  Spyro is much better than that overrated Crash Bandicoot game, and you should pick up Spyro the Dragon today.",4,dragon madness!,1155168000,"08 10, 2006"

The characters and art styles of the game were interesting this game reminded me of Max Payne. The problem is Max Payne was better and it came out what 8 years ago. The aiming for this shooter is a bit dated what saves it is that when you jump slide or shoot time is slowed down and ruby always lock on one target with her duel weapons allowing you to mow down enemies. In fact if you aren't jumping or sliding or something you'll be dead soon. This works fine in combat and its fun. However the numerous bugs and glitches wear your patience thin by the 3rd level and things keep sliding down from there. I died a ton of times trying to jump from ledges due to poor camera and touchy controls. There were numerous sequences that really pissed me off. First there was this spot where you fell from a plane that must have took me about an hour and half to master. Then there was an area were you had to slide under a door and shoot 2 locks on each side to progress the auto aim is random and I found this task to be harder than it should have.

My boyfriend plays in a band, and I sang in choirs throughout school. So we are both fairly musical and have quite a lot of gear in the house. My boyfriend's been gigging for over twenty years. He understand issues of microphone noise, feedback, sensitivity, and so on.We own not only multiples of this Rock Band microphone but also the Konami microphone, EA microphone, Guitar Hero microphone, Logitech microphone, and others.We're extremely pleased with this Rock Band microphone. Looks-wise, the silver grill does look snazzy. The long length is a great help when you are stretched out in a room with drum players, guitar players, and keyboard players. The Rock Band cable has a ""box"" near the XBox end which has an image of a microphone on it. This is great when you're trying to figure out which cables to unplug and which not to touch.But of course it all comes down to the microphone's performance. A gorgeous microphone which causes you to continually fail will get tossed into the trash rather quickly.Luckily, as you might imagine, the Rock Band team made absolutely sure that their branded microphone would work well. They wouldn't want to be deluged with complaints that reaching 100% on a song in easy mode was impossible. I have tried these microphones on pretty much every song I can get my hands on, on expert mode, and I routinely get to 100%. I know it's hard to read tone in an email - I don't mean that in a boastful way. I know many, many people who can do that and who are far better singers than I am. What I mean is that the microphone doesn't distort or affect your rhythm or pitch. It transmits - accurately - your voice's twists and turns and gets it into the core machine.As an added advantage, the microphone ends in a simple USB plug. This means this unit can move between the Wii, PS3, and XBox 360 units. So if you have multiple systems, like we do, you can move this high quality microphone between them.Highly recommended.We purchased our microphones with our own funds in order to do our testing and reviews.",5,Rock Band branded microphone is well worth it,1358640000,"01 20, 2013"

Everything or Nothing is based off the film when Piece Brosnan was still the famous spy, and Everything or Nothing is pretty solid. The story is pretty nonsensical and is your typical Bond plot with a bad guy (Willam Defoe) hellbent on ruling the world. Diavolo has nanomites that can eat through metal, and plans on attaching payloads of this stuff on nukes. Bond runs into henchman (Jaws) and beautiful women to stop the evil mad man.The best part about the are the vehicle sections, and the shooting sections are hard as all hell and mundane. I'm going to throw that out there right now. The vehicle sections have Bond driving real world vehicles with missiles, machine guns, flame throwers, and oil slicks attached to them. What makes the driving sections so grand is the sense of speed. Driving across a bridge, jumping through signs, finding shortcuts to trigger ""Bond Moments"". While these are hard to find (even in on foot sections) they can be satisfying. Every driving section is different from escorts to flying over rooftops to races. All vehicles handle very well even at high speeds and this is what truly matters.The on foot sections are mundane and extremely frustrating. Even on the easiest setting the game throws dozens of bad guys at you and ammo is a loot and hunt type thing. You start out with a puny P99 pistol and the game throws about 10 bad guys at you. The lock on feature is clumsy since you can't lock on unless the camera is facing an enemy. If you get close enough to someone Bond will put his gun away and start meleeing while other guys around him are shooting. This can make you die in very tight spots. The melee is pretty basic with heavy and light punches along with counters. You can hide behind cover, but this tends to be a problem if the cover is taller then Bond can shoot.You can use a lot of gadgets, but they tend to be useless unless the level requires them. You get Q spiders which are remote operated spiders that can blow thing up and go inside little nooks. The coin grenades are pretty straight forward, but have crappy physics and bounce around like rubber balls. There's the nano suit which makes you invisible, but I never even had to use this since stealth in this game is very hard and almost not an option. The rappel gun is what I used most. Being a Bond game I wish the gadgets would have come in more handy, but they are they if you really want to use them. The shooting sections are just so frustrating due to the unbalanced difficulty. I died over 10 times on certain missions, and there are no checkpoints. Some of the longer levels have one, but most levels have none and this can make you throw your controller across the room.The graphics are pretty decent for a 2004 PS2 game. The textures are solid, the audio is nice, and there is only slight framerate problems due to the PS2's limitations. There is online co-op, but this will never be tested since the servers were shut down. There's a lot of missions in this game, and it will keep you busy for a good 8-10 hours depending on how many times you die. The game is pretty solid and you won't be disappointed. Even people who don't like Bond can enjoy this game and that's the beauty of it.",3,"Best Bond game to date, but way too hard",1332892800,"03 28, 2012"

This isn't just any ordinary pet sim, there was actually much research and time put into this game to make it as realistic as it looks.  Dogs move, act, react, and sound like they should.  Each model greatly resembles the breed intended, as acts and thinks as a dog would.  Not only that, there are a lot of aspects of the game that add to the overall experience.Besides being able to teach it tricks, you can pet it using the touch screen, talk to it in cutesy talk as I like to call it, give it baths, take it for walks, enter it in competition, have it interact with you dog via Wi-Fi connect, feed it, and more.  There is just so much you can do with your dog, that it almost replaces your dog.Nintendo did keep away anything morbid, like your dog dying if you don't play with it for 2 weeks, or it actually having an ""accident"" in your house, or anything like that, but it does cover just about anything else.  You cannot abuse your dog either, and although it makes it less realistic, you should try to injure your dog anyways.With tons of tricks to do, a large handful of breeds to unlock,  competitions to win, and items to buy, this game will last you.  If you can only buy one DS game, this would be one very difficult game not be that game.  This is recommended for all ages, but I think even the older adults will find themselves enjoying their Nintendog.BOTTOM LINE: This user-friendly, very realistic dog simulator is by far one of the best DS games, and should be considered for everyone's collection for people of all ages.FINAL NOTE: The developers have said that they are considering on making a Nintencats, do look out for that in the future.",5,How can resist such adorable dogs?,1128816000,"10 9, 2005"

I'd never ventured into the horror / escape genre before, but so many people raved about the earlier editions that I thought I'd give this one a try. First of all, I freely admit that I am not an extremely devoted gamer. I have a lot of things going on in life and can't devote hours and hours at a time to the diversion (unfortunately). That being said, it only took about 15 minutes of play to realize that this game is ridiculously difficult. I don't necessarily mind difficulty, but the character himself (Leon) fights like Gumby or a gingerbread man, and this was very frustrating. He can only lamely and clumsily slash a knife in the air and shoot a wimpy handgun that he can't aim for garbage. There is no way to lock-on to targets like in other games, so you have to manually point the weapon. Even then, it only works at close range. Additionally, he can't duck, jump, punch, kick or do anything unless the game prompts him to. All the while, enemies can deftly pitchfork, stab, grab and bite at will. Admittedly, as the game progresses, Leon can upgrade to some better guns, but there's no way to improve his knife or pathetic combat skills. And he is ALWAYS running out of ammo, and forced to feebly swat with that knife. I can't count how many times I thought to myself, ""This is so stupid."" And the story itself is a disaster. The US President's daughter has been kidnapped and all they can send is this one wimpy ""fighter"" who has a 9mm pistol with a few clips and a survival knife that he barley knows how to use?

8247,49276,A1TJIJKKN15KR9,B0002GTFIK,drqshadow,"[3, 6]","Probably one of the biggest surprises I've ever enjoyed during my years in front of a video game console came when I first tried my hand at an unsuspecting little package dubbed Star Ocean: The Second Story. This old, overlooked two-disc pack for the PSone had been literally gathering dust on my shelf for years before I bothered to even test it out, and I suppose that complete lack of any kind of previous expectation was a big part of why I was so totally impressed and engulfed by what I found within the game itself. Unfortunately, by overwhelming me so effectively in its first American offering, my expectations for the future of the Star Ocean franchise went through the roof. In a way, it's funny; I loved the precursor because I expected nothing of it and received everything I ever could've wanted, and then subconsciously built up the sequel to the point that nothing it could muster would ever be enough to appease me.To start with, the story is beyond terrible and the characters are even worse. When I first met Fayt and Sophia, the two leads, I couldn't help but grimace. They're so paper-thin, so incredibly dull and intelligence-insultingly bland, I initially mistook them for a heavy-handed satire of the role playing genre in general. This is, honest to god, the most uninspiring cast I've seen since console RPGs were just gaining their footing in Final Fantasy I back on the NES. They'll say and do things that'll just make you stare blankly for a few seconds and then explode into unrelenting laughter. Fayt, in particular, is the very epitome of a stereotype. He has no flaws, and as a result he makes an incredibly boring leader. The characters seem so out of touch with reality that nothing ever seems to carry the kind of magnitude you'd hope for, even when entire worlds are exploding and individual races are being completely wiped from existence. By the time the third act comes around, bringing with it the one really interesting revelation in the storyline, you're forty hours in and have cemented your opinion of the game as a whole. Before that, it's cliche after cliche, with absolutely no originality thrown in to keep things halfway interesting.Like its predicessor, TtEoT's gameplay is its greatest triumph. The battles have remained every bit as enjoyable and strategically brilliant as I remembered, and the controls are incredibly easy to comprehend. You'll have, at most, three characters in your party at any one time (which is a major gripe I've had with the RPG genre in general for years now... why would six people stand by and watch their three buddies struggle in a fight with monsters, rather than joining in and cleaning house?) and they're all performing individual actions at the same time, to say nothing of the monsters on the other side of the battlefield. At a glance it would appear to be mildly organized chaos, but in action it's really pretty simple. Before, after and during the battle, you can set a specific attack style for the characters you won't be directly controlling, so they aren't wasting all of their strength on a meaningless enemy while a tough boss fight is just around the corner. If you want your weakest character to avoid physical confrontations and concentrate on healing, it's as easy as changing a setting. Usually, two members of your party will be following these instructions at any time, while you'll be directly in control of the third. Yet, despite the seemingly-obvious directions, the computer AI will occasionally find a way to screw up. Whether they're running headfirst into an explosion with low HP or repeatedly casting heal on a teammate who doesn't need it, your comrades will generally leave a lot to be desired. I even ran into a few instances where I'd found myself single-handedly taking on half a dozen enemies while my two teammates stood off in a corner somewhere and cheered me on.Aside from the cutscenes, this is generally a visually uninspiring game. The characters look about as stale and unexciting as they act, and the environments and spells are nothing that hasn't already been done better by a previous title. To be frank, the Sega Dreamcast could have more than likely produced graphics equal to the ones seen here, and that's a tremendous knock at this stage in the PS2's life cycle. With the PS3 peeking over the horizon, this should be the point in time when game developers are really starting to stretch Sony's aging console to the limits with amazing graphical effects, not leaning back and kicking out weak, flat displays such as this. Occasionally you'll run into an enemy or dungeon that's up to par visually with its contemporaries, but on the large I wasn't impressed. The graphical direction and wardrobe designs are solid enough, but it looks like a lot of the charm was lost in the translation from pen and paper to fully interactive three-dimensionality. As I alluded to earlier, the cutscenes are outstanding, but you'd expect that from a Square-Enix RPG.This current-gen revisiting of developer tri-Ace's shining star feels like a hollow, emotionless shell more than it does a sequel five and a half years in the making. Rarely have I been more disappointed in a big follow-up title than I was with this one. It's strictly average, with passable graphics, weak voice acting, horrible characters and a mind-numbingly slow story killing any forward progress made by the battle system, which is still quite a blast. I feel dirty for considering this as a contemporary to The Second Story, although I'm beginning to question if even the PSone rendition was actually as good as I remember it. I don't think the ultimate goal of a sequel should be to force its fans to re-evaluate their feelings about the original.",3,Largely Disappointing,1116115200,"05 15, 2005"

But it doesn't save the rest of it. The life or lackthereof on the sidelines continues to be dead. No pun. Literally. Motionless bodies of sidelined players, cardboard cutouts of cameramen and non-existent of life. Really? This is 2014 NCAA?The new infinity engine isn't too bad. Its the best the game has probably felt yet. You can finally interrupt an animation and when a second defender is going after the runner, he can affect the play regardless if the other defender is affecting the base runner. So you can have 2, 3, 4 even 5 guys truly make a difference on a tackle. Running, passing, feels better, blocking is better and I finally feel I can play defense, while it's still broken in parts. With hurry up offense players, it's difficult for a defense to get set as usual. Zone still doesn't seem very effective. DBS still seem to be suckers for curl and slant routes. Especially when you start boosting up the difficulty. Sometimes the CPU QB can go like 100% for 2 quarters and not break a sweat. I recommend lowing the CPU QB sliders to under 40 to make for a more realistic experience. As always, don't bother playing online. Game is unplayable with the unstoppable plays and cheese game that they always ways to exploit this game. E.A. has done nothing to make this a better and fair online experience. Stick with playing with friends or the CPU.Graphics are great in spots, downright shoddy in others. The grass/fields look amazing. Animations are well done and the tackles are pretty intense at times. Player models, ehhh, let's just say, they don't look any worse than they did the last 3 years. The stadiums look good, that is until you look at the fans who are the continuous worst looking fans in sports games. They are motionless cardboard cutouts. There is no life on sidelines, at all. No bustling people, no cheerleaders, no cameramen and the players and coaches just stand there like zombies.Overall. I do regret spending the 60 bucks this year. I'm already getting bored with it. It still doesn't feel like college football to me do to the poor presentation that E.A refuses to truly improve. If they fix the audio cutting out, that will help. But it can't fix a horrible presentation that has been with this game since the PS2 and XBOX days. Probably better to wait for next gen.

The first Darksiders seemed cartoony and generic, but after seeing it for $5 I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did, it was one of the better games I played.Having played the first Darksiders picking up Darksiders II was a no-brainer.  Darksiders plays very similar to God of War, so it you like action/ hack'n'slash/ adventure, you found a great game to play.  Darksiders II adds a more in depth inventory system so it's got a stronger RPG element to it.  This means a lot of time in the menus seeing if you got something better.  Gameplay is tight and the sound is quite good.As far as the story, it picks up on the first game.  There is a brief recap, but here's mine:  War (hero of the first game) is tricked into bringing the apocalypse upon the Earth and starts a terrible chain of events.  This game you play as Death, War's brother (both are Nephilim if you were wondering), and you are trying to clear War's name.  Pestilence and Famine aren't really in the game, but they are hinted at; mostly to do a sequel if this sells enough copies.I payed full price at launch and am very happy with my experience with the game.  Whatever it's selling for at this moment will be money well spent.  If you are into action games and want a good story, pick this game up.",4,Hoping for a Third One,1353715200,"11 24, 2012"

Perhaps the duct tape mod would be welcomed by some, but I am amongst the old-school crowd who thought there would be an option to turn it off, only to find out...alas, it cannot be so.The graphics are really not that much of an improvement.  The texturing and resolution get a sizable boost, but the lighting is way off.  I suspect this adverse lighting was to accentuate the need to use the new flashlight, but in the end, everything is so dark, that the light becomes a crutch throughout.  You may actually forget it's on, as it makes the levels look normal whilst activated.  Of course, since it is basically the Half-Life flashlight, you'll often find yourself running out of juice when you really don't want to.  There is virtually no customization whatsoever.  The controls have been butchered.  It feels like neither CoD, nor the Doom of old, and worst of all, hot keys...are...a-gonne!  Menus are bland and generic, along with the Classic Doom games, which really fail to capture the intensity and innovation that they possessed when they first came out.  There's very poor presentation throughout this game...and the guns? Worthless!  You could throw your shotgun at an Imp, and do more damage than shooting him with it!  Most of the trophies are really easy to get, but that's assuming you'll want to play this game long enough to get the 60%+ that are easy as pie, before you move up to the REAL annoying ones!I really don't know what the point of this release was, nor do I know the direction id Software is going in general.  There's much word Doom 4 won't release until PS4/Xbox 720, but then they reallocate everyone, and shut down every other project they have going on to work on Doom 4.  I also don't understand why you'd re-release Quake 4 on the 360, and not on the PS3 as well!  Perhaps these were just cash grabs.  Maybe Bethesda expects id to create a steady stream of money coming in at all times.  Whatever the logic, I feel id Software will always remain one of the industry's most iconic and respected development houses, and I sure hope Bethesda is taking care of them.  I hope they don't put Carmack, Willits, Hollenshead, and the rest of the gang in the pressure cooker, so they can get Doom 4 right!  We NEED a good Doom game, now more than ever!Graphics-6/10A myriad of problems, starting with the lighting.  Stop letting ordinary gamers help create your games, people.

Normally, when you're going to progress to a new level, there's something indicative of a level change; a door maybe, or a switch of some sort. But no... In Max Payne 3, you can be walking toward the final piece of a Golden Gun and, without warning, you're on to the next stage; no opening of a new door, no triggering a new switch, just ""too bad, so sad, guess you won't be obtaining that Golden Gun trophy/achievement until next playthrough.""

Ghosts had a really great campaign which I didn't experience any problems with. I had heard that BF4 was supposed to be more realistic, so I thought I'd give it a try. It's a great game so far. I haven't tried multiplayer, but the campaign is lengthy and keeps you on your toes. You can command vehicles like previous iterations and destroy buildings if you have heavy enough weaponry. All around, I really enjoy it.But that's where the good ends. About 4 missions into the game, I began experiencing the bugs that are plaguing the game. At first it was minor - the game froze and I had to restart. All games do this on occasion right? BF4 takes it to another level and froze again and the very end of that mission, so I had to replay from my last checkpoint - again. Maybe it was just a problem with my hardware surely. Nope. The next mission froze at the very end causing me to restart from the last checkpoint again. Fast forward to now. I am near the end of the Tashgar mission and my game froze. By now I was used to the constant freezing; except this time I couldn't restart from my last checkpoint. Instead, the game would freeze in the middle of the opening cutscene (loading screen). After a bit of searching, I found that this is a very common problem that is caused by a corrupted save game. So I have to start this mission over from the beginning! Not fun.To add on to the game-breaking bugs, I've experienced sound glitching as well. There will be moments where all I can hear is static and a few gunshots. At one point I lost all of my sound after getting flashbanged. ""Oh this is realistic!"" was my first impression, until of course, it stayed like that for the rest of the mission.I want to like this game. I really want to.

I am not disappointed.It's still the same old formula, you move your 'cannon' along the bottom of the screen and shoot moving 'invaders' as they inch closer and closer towards earth.  This time though, there are a lot of variations in the mix.  The invaders themselves come in several different sizes, extra small, small, regular, large and extra large.  They are set up in various formations and have different flight patterns and attacks as well.  Some invaders have shields, some have reflective shields that bounce your shots back at you, some even turn sideways and being two dimensional, they nearly disappear! There are also new type of UFOs, each with different colors and attacks.Scoring is based on several factors.  You can set up scoring combos with a 3 second timer.  As long as you keep killing, the combo chain remains.  You are also awarded bonus points for level-specific attacks, like shooting out each column or row at a time, killing all the same color or shape opponent in row, etc.  Also, if you kill four of the same color enemies in a row, a timed weapon upgrade appears... this can be a laser, bomb, or spread shot.  Complete the level-specific attacks to deploy a flashing UFO. Shoot him down and a minigame starts, maybe kill X amount of invaders in a certain timeframe, or kill just one well protected invader, etc.Boss battles signal the end of a level.  They are often very large invaders and have different critical kill spots.One great addition to the classic gameplay is the ability to save and start at the beginning of the level when you load or continue a game.  No more starting from scratch every time.  Your score will also start at whatever it was at the beginning of the level, so you can rebuild on that.A multiplayer mode is included via Ad-Hoc as well.At $19.99, this title is a steal for fans of retro gaming, causal gamers (you only use one button after all), or hardcore gamers looking for a challenge as the levels become faster and the enemies come in thick waves.My only knock is that some of the backgrounds are a bit 'Windows 95-y'... just boring, ugly text floating around.

Not that they are bad mind you; some are outright fantastic (Metroid Prime 3, Zelda, Mario Galaxy) but a lot of them are either family/kid-oriented, using the controller in a gimmicky-""aint-this-neat"" way or they're just ports of other games with Wii controls. But now and then one will surprise you and while it might not be buy-worthy - unless you have kids in which they'll have loads of fun with this - Lego Star Wars is a game that's quite fun although it does run into a few flaws.Story: The selling point is that you can replay the entire Star Wars saga in game form, starting with the Phantom Menace right till the end with Return of the Jedi. Some faithfully recreate moments from the films, including camera angles at times, while in others it changes it in a quirky way (example, in Episode I where Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan ambush the droids on Naboo, instead of both fighting them, Qui-Gon does the work while Obi-Wan's lightsaber malfunctions, complete with a facepalming Qui-Gon).Graphics: This ain't Mario Galaxy or even the Umbrella Chronicles but the graphics here are quite charming since everything's done entirely in legos (obviously) so it's a very inviting and kid-friendly atmosphere. In 480p, there's not a lot of super impressive effects save for the lightsaber glow but everything looks shinier.Sound/Music: No real voice acting to speak of save Metroid-style grunts and yells from various characters but the music of course faithfully recreates the film's soundtracks. My one problem, strangely is that the volume seemed kind of low and it didn't really knock me on my you-know-what. I loved playing Knights of the Old Republic because the sound really made the experience epic while here the music should've been brought up more.Gameplay: Platform-style through various levels with a couple of vehicle-based missions (the podrace in Episode I for instance). The stages are filled to the brim with things to ""force"" which'll yield money, things you can build/destroy or activate. You travel with a pack that can range from small characters who can travel small spaces, R2-D2 who can hover for a short time or others that can hookshot up onto a ledge. My one complaint is that at times you'll find yourself unsure of where to go and it's only through either trial-and-error or just accidentally stumbling on it that you'll know where to go.What makes the game's replay value through the roof is with the money and level collectibles that can be found. If you ever love 100%-ing a game like the Grand Theft Autos or Metroids, you'll be busy with this as not only are there is characters to unlock and things to buy but a percentage rating for each stage. What might bug people of the games is that aside from the combination of both trilogies, nothing really substantial has been added. While it's more neater to have lightsaber sounds come out of the Wii-mote (which by the way can be used for lightsaber action but it's not direction-specific. ie swing up, characters swings up etc, it's just an ordinary swipe), it's basically the same thing but for those, like me, who have never played a Lego Star Wars game before, this is the one to get.Small kids will find a lot to like with this one as not only is it Star Wars but there's just so much to do and it's all in Legos so big plus there. Adults will find it fun but it's not really deep involving gameplay, it's just enjoyable to play.",3,3.5; family fun across the universe,1200700800,"01 19, 2008"

10237,65731,A1YEPFLLH42OU1,B000ELW4D6,"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia ""Yu-Jin Chia""","[0, 0]","Guild Wars: Factions is the second Guild Wars campaign, and adds the continent of Cantha on a separate map from the original (Prophecies) campaign. The storyline is new, with only minor connections to Prophecies, and the areas and NPCs have a distinctly oriental appearance to them. Factions adds new PVP elements to the Guild Wars experience, new skills and classes, and faction allegiance elements.On the PVE side, Factions adds a new campaign and two new classes- the ritualist and the assassin. In general, assassins are very strong vs. single targets- similar to rogues in World of Warcraft- but are not cut out to tank or to do massive area damage. Ritualists are one of the more versatile classes in the game due to their selection of spirits and spells, and can make good healers or damage dealers. Of special note, they have many skills that either create or assist them while carrying items, which means that with certain builds you can actually do fine with no weapons. This is certainly the only class for which that holds true. You can often find henchmen of these classes available, which is a nice touch.You start characters at a relatively easy pace on Shing Jea island, and by the time you leave there you will probably be around level 15. Leveling characters off the island is a very rapid process, as most quests give upwards of 3,000 experience. In fact, the Factions mainland is by far the fastest means of leveling characters in any of the Guild Wars campaigns. If you own other campaigns, you can take your characters directly to the mainland, and your Factions characters can enter other campaigns once they reach it. Note here that Factions does not, in itself, support heroes. If you want heroes, you'll need to get either Nightfall or Eye of the North (highly recommended, as henchmen in general are quite flaky teammates). Once you do, there is only one hero available in Factions itself- the assassin Zenmai- so you'll have to travel to the other campaigns to recruit the others.New skills in factions include a lot of unique- some quite useful- regular skills, plus a handful of 'cloned' skills that are identical to existing Prophecies skills, and of course some new elite skills. Some of the elite skills are available in Eye of the North, and in some cases are substantially easier to acquire in that campaign. Though at first one might think the cloned skills are useless, they can actually be quite useful if you really like the skill in question. This is because they don't share cooldowns, enabling you to essentially use the same skill twice in a row. The most new skills are, naturally, for the assassin and ritualist. However, since you can take those classes as secondary professions, it's likely you'll find many of these that will be useful for other characters. In particular, assassin skills tend to be useful in PVP, and ritualist skills can make some very difficult PVE encounters a joke.The Factions campaign is very standard Guild Wars fare, with one major difference from the prior Prophecies campaign. That is, you can't complete missions out of order- you are physically barred from proceeding to new areas until you pass the requisite missions. This is good for the story flow, but it can be frustrating for those that love to take shortcuts. The campaign story is about what you would expect- nothing that will knock your socks off, but not bad either. Some of the missions offer departures from the norm, such as a few that can involve two separate parties of 8 players. In practice, however, these tend to run very similar to standard Prophecies-style missions. For example, there rarely is another player waiting to do those two-party ones, so you usually just end up with a ton of henchmen. In most cases, you achieve the mission bonus by simply finishing under a certain time, not by doing special tasks as in Prophecies or Nightfall. Generally, the areas are quite well done, and you'll see a lot of new enemies and settings. Even the henchmen are quite unique, including such oddities as giant trained necromancer rats and a ranger that has a pet crab. This is generally a good thing, but there is one major point of irritation: different outposts have different henchmen, so often when you arrive in another town you'll lose part of your party and have to replace them. Also, there's a few outposts that have highly impractical henchmen, including at least one where the only healers available are mediocre at best. I suppose this is the price one pays for variety, which is probably why Nightfall and Eye did away with it. Completing various stages in the campaign allows you access to new items and armor, as well. Some of these armors use materials tied into faction (more on that later) and most of them are quite unique in appearance.PVP is supposed to be one of the main enhanced aspects in this expansion, and to some degree it is indeed better. There is one new PVP mode in Factions: Alliance Battles (AB). In this, you form a group of 4 and enter battle alongside 2 other groups, either fighting for the Kurzick or Luxon sides. It is a very straightforward game of domination, with only a few minor features like resurrection orbs to set it apart from any other domination mode in the scores of multiplay games out there. There are 5 AB maps, and only one of them is truly 'fair.' The others either slightly or strongly favor one side, and are determined by the state of the territorial border between the Kurzicks and Luxons. Thus, if the Luxons control most of the territory, the maps will favor the Kurzicks, and vice versa. In theory this sounds like a cool idea- it encourages the sides to push each other for territory, since having your favorite outposts in enemy hands is inconvenient (for one, resurrection shrines near them won't work unless you bribe the priests). It also means everyone will get a chance to win. In practice, it makes Alliance Battles a really boring wait. The problem is that people KNOW that when their side has most of the territory, the map will heavily favor the enemy. And let's face it, nobody likes to lose an endless string of battles in a row. The fact that you have no idea who is going to be in the other two teams in your match doesn't help, since even the best 4-man party isn't going to be able to do much with 8 supporting nimrods or AFK'ers.Additionally, there are static PVP missions- Fort Aspenwood and the Jade Quarry- in which individuals join an 8v8 scenario with more wrinkles than simple domination or deathmatch. These are generally quite fun, but also tend to run a lot longer than AB and- especially in the case of Jade Quarry- have very few participants in comparison. For those seeking faction, you can also run competitive missions, which reward you based on your score, and repeatable quests. The latter are by far the fastest way to earn faction, but due to their very nature are also the most boring. The main advantage of these non-PVP faction farming methods is that you don't have to wait in a queue, and you can easily do any of them solo.To facilitate the factions style of competition, guilds can form alliances with other guilds of the same allegiance (Kurzick or Luxon). Joining such a guild allows you to contribute faction to your alliance, which in turn allows your alliance to compete for 'ownership' of outposts. The benefits of ownership are largely simple prestige, but also help determine the border between the factions. Contributing faction to your alliance grants double points for the Kurzick/Luxon title track, which affects the power of Kurzick/Luxon PVE-only skills. These skills are very powerful- at higher title track ranks, clearly overpowered- and (unlike most other titles) progress in the title track is shared across all characters in your account. You can also spend faction to acquire the skills themselves, or to buy materials for Kurzick or Luxon armor (two looks for each).Factions is, generally speaking, a good game. For newcomers to Guild Wars, I wouldn't recommend it above the others, but it makes a good expansion for veteran players. In particular, those who want a bit more PVP in the game will like what Factions offers, though I should caution that it's still a long way from true 'world PVP.' The campaign is decent, particularly if you like to level up characters quickly, and has some nice extras and rewards. Additionally, the two new classes are great, and are probably worth getting the game for just by themselves.",4,Expanding the Guild Wars experience,1211846400,"05 27, 2008"

However, even though its basic looking it does not look (or feel) cheap.  It appears to be sturdy enough to take the occasional drop without it falling apart.  From past experiences, I have never had any issues with Logitech products and I suspect this one will be no different.

It works flawlessly with my XBOX games (no games to test it on with my PS3) and on my laptop when I use it with my Rosetta Stone software.  The best thing about this is that it requires no drivers, all you have to do is plug in the USB transponder to your device and turn the Microphone on and your good to go; the batteries are even included!The reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the steep price, but if having a wireless mic is THAT important to you, then the price should not be an issue.

Well hold onto your hat because we've got just the game to do it. Mystery Case Files: MillionHeir is a new game for the Nintendo DS that takes this concept and wraps it in a new package for today's generation.Million Heir's story is simple, a rich guy has gone missing and it's up to you to solve the mystery. Make no mistake, this is no Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew conspiracy that requires keen interrogation skills or psychic -like intuition to solve. All you need is a keen eye because you'll be hunting the most irrelevant clues you've ever come across. Seriously, the hidden objects that you must find to unravel the clues have nothing to do with anything. Found that scalloped shell and bowling pin in the tool shed? Great! Now go find an alien in the garden (no, the alien isn't even a suspect). That said, the nonsensical clues aren't really the point. Hunting down these camouflaged objects is what it's all about.Maybe your kids will get a hold of this and think, hey, I'm tired of using my eyes, I'll just click around randomly like I'm having a caffeine seizure and beat this silly little game! That might work for a while, but the game introduces a good mix of tools that you'll have to use in later stages to find the clues such as flashlights for the dark and a super straw for blowing out fires. There's also a healthy mix of puzzles and amusing mini-games to break up the repetitiveness.Even though you visit each stage more than once, the items you have to find are different each time. Since there are dozens and dozens of hidden objects, but you only need find the handful on your list, you'll find yourself taking mental notes that the knight is wielding a hammer for some odd reason for the next time you return. In addition, there is a good sense of humor mixed into the scenes that your kids might not catch but will certainly make us older folk giggle.Despite the fact the game can be completed by a determined spy in a couple of evenings and the objects are always in the same place, the sheer number of things to find are plentiful enough to keep your kids coming back for more than once. The art is great and the mood music is exceptional, making it a treat for the senses. A wide range of ages would enjoy this game, though I would recommend being available when they're struggling to understand what a halberd or obelisk even is, much less where it is hidden.The game is available for just under $20 bucks.

Though while still very good, with other games pushing the PS2's graphical power, the Max Payne is looking a little long in the tooth.Max Payne is a New York detective who's wife and young child are brutally murdured. Three years later, the story is about to come full circle as Payne finally discovers who has shattered his entire world.Max Payne's biggest strength is it's story. The storyline is very compelling and will make you keep wanting to play the game. Full of mobsters, wise guys, low-lifes, and all around scum bags, the developers are Remedy and Rockstar Games have painted a very dark and gritty picture of the New York underworld. If Max Payne were made into a movie, I'm thinking it could very easily make the transition from game to screen. The cutscenes however leave something to be desired. They consist of comic book style frames with voice overs. But the story does manage to make it's way through them.Although while still good, Max Payne's graphics are somewhat subpar when you compare them to other games that have been released in the past few years. The character models are somewhat primitive by today's standards. Where as a game like the Getaway has more photo-realistic renderings, Max Payne's are almost stick figure like. What Max Payne'graphics do very well, however, is portray New York City extremely accurately. Everything from the graffitti on the walls to the subway stations has a very ""New York feel"" to it. The framerate, however, suffers from considerable slowdown. Often time it slows to a crawl. The sounds are very good. Guns have loud ""Bangs"" and you hear bullet casings hit the ground. The games music is very ominous sounding, giving you a chilling foreshadowing of things to come.Max Payne's controlls are a little difficult to grasp at first. The targeting reticule consists of a white ""dot"" in the center of the screen, and you aim by moving the right analog stick. It's a bit tricky and takes some getting used to. One of the game's standout features is Bullet Time. Max can slow down time around him and execute Matrix-like moves. Max Payne restores his health by rummaging in medicine cabinets and closets for painkillers. A bit of a unique change from the standard med-packs and meal rations.Overall Max Payne is a good game.

Unlike the Sengoku period of the default game, which was about warlords seeking their own power, the Boshin war is a dedicated ""civil war"" between those who support the Shogun and those who support the Emperor. The Imperial side is traditionalist, supporting a return to the old ways and the isolation of Japan. The Shogun's side is modernist, favoring greater trade with the outside world. While each side is made up of multiple areas and factions, the two greater sides are very concrete and meaningful in the game.Like the standard game and the Rise of the Samurai DLC, ""Fall of the Samurai"" has its own aesthetics and gameplay dynamics that are largely independent from other versions of the game. One of the most noticeable struggles in the game's campaign mode is between modernity and tradition. Upgrading your technology can give you advantages - guns, artillery, industry - but doing so undermines Japanese history and culture. Remaining traditional presents advantages in the form of better morale and training for ""classical"" units like armored samurai. Traditional units are weaker at range, but if they can close into melee distance they vastly overpower unarmored riflemen. The balance between ""modern"" and ""traditional"" is established pretty well in the game's combat system. The broken, hilly terrain of Shogun 2's battle-maps means that modern forces won't automatically have an advantage, but if they can catch traditional armies in the open their range can make or break an entire battle.While many of the campaign's elements are similar to Shogun 2's previous incarnations, there's enough new twists and turns to keep things interesting. The ""civil war"" dynamic is totally different from the ""every warlord for himself"" of the Sengoku period or the ""spread your family's influence"" of Rise of the Samurai. The split between modern and traditional defines most of Fall of the Samurai's gameplay, with foreign powers and trading becoming a major issue later on. Sea battles are more important now, as fleets can provide supporting fire for land-based battles or bombard cities. In some senses the classic ""build structures in towns, move armies around maps"" gameplay feels kind of dated and ""gamey"", but the battles themselves work great.The aesthetic for Fall of the Samurai is based around maps of the period, using a more grey-toned style compared to the highly colorful styles of Shogun 2 and Rise of the Samurai. I've heard mixed opinions about this, but personally I don't like it at all. The 3d models still look great, but the campaign map is just very drab and dull-looking (intentionally so, but ugly is ugly). Overall, the game is definitely distinct as its own concept - a concept whose execution could have been done better, but a distinct and novel concept nonetheless.Rating: 8/10.We purchased this game with our own funds in order to do this review.",4,distinct and novel concept,1336608000,"05 10, 2012"

I am an average to modest gamer, do not find much time for games and have to admit that I loved Halo 1 for originality and playability.  The hype for Halo 2 even got to me, I could not wait until it's release, and now that I have it, I want to know how I finished it so fast.  Played Saturday & Sunday over probably 10 total hours on Normal level, but don't recommend playing on heroic or legendary to extend gameplay unless you like the feeling of having 10 linebackers pile on top of you.The game was great, but didn't live up to a lot of the reviews posted by total Halo fanatics, especially who say this is the best game ever. It is good, but there are better.  I am reviewing the Limited Edition as that is what I bought.There are improvements to the first game, but this game lacks in the same way the movie Attack of the Clones pales in comparison to the original Star Wars series.  Here are my reasons:How better:Graphics - A step up from the first game, obviously more time was spent in designing.Deathmatch - Play is better on some levels and the weapons & equipment offer more options to take out your friend.  There is even an updated version of Blood Gulch.Vehicles - More vehicles to choose from, and you can steal from other players both friends and computer.Better AI - Marines are smarter, and this time, they can drive while you shoot.Limited Edition Extra - DVD included with metal cased Limited Edition is full of more extra's than I have time to watch.  Well worth the extra $5.How not better:Story - story is the same as first Halo, with no new elements added.  Covenant are still dumb enough to think Halo is a salvation tool.Playability - If you liked the library scene and the Flood (character in 1st) you will love Halo 2.  Lots of flood and dark scenes.  Some levels you find yourself running for the checkpoint rather than digging in and fighting.  Too many obstacles and clutter.Overall, this is a great game and will probably break the game sales record.  Sorry to the Halo fans who think everyone should give this a 5 star all around.  If you have not tried Halo 1, you might want to buy it first as it has levels you will want to play over and over.

Breath of Fire One seems to be what most people I talk to about games  consider the best. Even though I loved Breath of Fire 2 the most. I  expected a lot from breath of fire 3. Perhaps this helped lower my opinion  of Breath of fire 3, but I did not like this game.As far as game play  goes like all BoF games in BoF 3 you have the ability to turn into a  dragon. Like BoF 1 and unlike BoF2 when you turn into a dragon you stay one  for a while. While you're a dragon you loose MP every turn to keep you from  staying one forever in that combat unlike BoF 1. All the character seem to  get their own special power. The character list is short and one of the  characters on the list of the book never fights with you as a character.  The training system you can find people to help you with is actually kind  of pointless weird and honestly I didn't like it. The town to town walking  is slow and you never get fast transportation.As far as plot goes the  plot is the plot starts off okay. Then about two hours in goes in a  different direction. It is fine for a while then but around the end is a  large dungeon that is boring to go threw and leaves the any not very much  of a climax. They lost any suspense you could have built up similar to the  Tales Of Destiny ending. Also the characters don't have very strong and  noticeable personalities. Also if you keep up with it you won't like the  direction the plot takes thirds of the way threw.As far as control goes  it's basically standard of with noting exceptionally notable about  it.The graphics to this game are not very good. It is done in sprites.  Sometimes I myself prefer sprits but I do not like the character drawings  of this game. On the walking town to town map character looks chubby and  short. The drawings are basic and too simple. There was only one of the  dragons I liked the look of. However there is a little onion that can  follow around with your party who beat all other RPGs in cuteness of a  single character. The cute hopping onion is defiantly the main reason to  buy this game if you do.And finally as far as length of time it can stay  interesting the game is longer them many RPGs won't be beaten on a short  rental.

6234,108474,A1H0CWFQY2HFGG,B001AS4TTE,"Bud Bundy ""B movie lover""","[3, 3]","I'm playing this using a Logitech Driving Force GT steering wheel.This is a rather small racing game, with fewer tracks and cars than most other games, but considering the rock-bottom price it's going for these days, I thought it would be a good deal.  And overall I guess it was.  You've got 4 different modes of play, the primary one is probably the ""Challenge"" mode.  This has three sets of races: European, Italian, and North American.  Each location has 7 races, and you have to use the exact same car for all the races.  You also have to do the races in order, 1, 2, 3 etc.  You can't skip ahead or go back.  You can set the length of each race for 5 minutes, 15 minutes, or longer.  You cannot restart any race, you can only exit the race, resulting in a last place finish, and then go on to the next race.  Winning races in this mode unlocks tracks for use in the other parts of the game, as well as unlocking cars which you can then purchase - but still not use in this part of the game, only the other modes.The other modes are Time Trial, where you drive around a track with no other cars on it, simply trying to set a good time.  Then there's Trophy mode, where you can race the cars you've purchased.  There are three races for each car, and I believe they last 10 minutes each. You have to race on the 3 tracks available for that car, you can't choose.  Then there's Arcade mode, where you have 4 races each in beginner, intermediate, expert and legend difficulty.  Once again, you can't choose the tracks, you can't skip ahead or go back, you just have to do them in order.The handling physics are very realistic in my opinion, of course I don't drive a lot of Ferrari's in real life.  And after playing this game, I wouldn't want to.  These cars have gigantic amounts of both oversteer and understeer.  Go into a corner at what seems like a very slow speed and the car will plow straight ahead.  And plow, and plow.  Once you finally get the front tires to hook up, stepping on the gas will send the rear end spinning around in front of you, so you have to use extremely mild and progressive throttle application.  And forget about stepping on the brakes if you're going around a corner, as you'll spin out instantly.  Eventually you settle into a routine of entering corners at an agonizingly slow speed (the speedometer says you're doping 40 mph but it sure looks more like 10 mph), then oh-so-gently get back on the throttle at the apex.  Of course you can turn on the driving aids like ABS brakes, traction control (keeps the tires from spinning under acceleration) and stability control, but that tends to limit how far you can push the car and makes it impossible to keep up with the AI cars.  You cannot upgrade any cars with performance parts, and you can only tune the one car that you use in the Challenge mode.And those AI cars.  Oh...My...God.  These things are imbecilic.  They are literally programmed to behave in exactly the opposite manner of real-life race drivers.  They move to the inside edge of a corner as you approach, blocking your passing attempt.  You can try to pass on the outside, but they'll just swing back to the outside as they exit the corner, drive straight into you, and then continue driving straight into you until you've dragged them halfway down the next straightaway.  It's absolutely maddening.  And they're always swerving all over the place.  As soon as you get used to trying to pass them on the outside (which is usually impractical), they'll decide to swerve over there and block you.  Coming up to a corner with two AI cars in front of you is always good for a laugh - the first one will take the corner normally, but the second one will move to the inside to block you, resulting in them running into each other just about every time.  The only reasonable solution is to play the game like a demolition derby, cutting inside corners and slamming into the side of the car ahead of you, which will almost always result in an easy pass.Between the abysmal AI and the rather small number of tracks, together with the extremely restrictive nature of the career mode, this game gets old pretty quick.  The good physics are fun, and as long as you're not battling the AI it's enjoyable to drive around the tracks.  The graphics are actually quite good considering the age of the game.  But if you're planning on playing this for more than a handful of evenings, you'll find yourself pretty bored and after too much time battling the AI, you'll be swearing at your TV screen like there's no tomorrow.",3,The good points are kind of outweighed by the bad.,1331337600,"03 10, 2012"

Basically a slow motion system that allows a pseudo-matrix style game play for a few brief seconds.  Apparently, they thought that such a gimmick could sell a game.  Unfortunately, thousands of people fell for it.  The only real revolutionary aspects of this game are the new heights of tedium that this game induces.This game starts off with a story consisting of a comic page animation (e.g. mostly still, cheaply made) with what apparently was an English major desperately trying to use big words and a raspy voice in order to sound sophisticated, deep, and dark.  This fails miserably and the darn thing never stops.  Then there is the game.  You can only save at the start of sub-levels, which automatically brings it down two notches.The game basically is a sequence where you turn a corner, wait for the slow bad guy, shoot, try to open a door, then try another, enter, wait, shoot, and on and on until you hit a save point.  That's it.  The first level is fine, but the second level gets you.  The controls are clunky and shooting is jerky and unresponsive.  Bullet damage is seemingly random.  Sometimes, you shoot a guy point blank with a shotgun, and he's barely touched.  You shoot a guy fifty feet away with a handgun, and he might go down for no reason.The first level is almost fun, since you might die to the randomness, but you'll have to repeat the killing of one or two guys again.  The second level, you sometimes have to face up to 15 guys.  It's no fun when the 15th guy, at 100 feet away and out of sight, shoots you in with a handgun and destroys all your health.  And it takes forever to return the same place beforehand.  The producers apparently couldn't differentiate between needless waiting and stealth.  By the middle of the game, I was so frustrated by the repeating, waiting, random deaths; I just turned it off and sold the game immediately.

So Amazon is a week late in distributing this game to people even though the Fallen Earth server has technically been online for 19 days. If you ordered off of Amazon, I'd be pretty annoyed.I've tried several MMOs over the years. My first one was Star Wars Galaxies when it was first released. It was a confusing experience at first because I wasn't used to the style of game play involved; mainly interacting with hundreds of other people online and the ""auto attack"" form of combat. I leaped into World of Warcraft several months after its release and played that for several years. Others MMOs would follow as I tried Pirates of the Burning Sea, Age of Conan, and Warhammer Online to name a few.I first heard about Fallen Earth a little over a month ago. I saw various beta reviews online (both written and video) and was intrigued about the game world and combat logistics involved. I love post-apocalyptic literature and have been trying to keep my eyes peeled for a cool MMO that catered to my demented fantasies of a ravaged earth. No, I don't WISH for the world to be like that, I just like reading stories about people surviving and overcoming overwhelming odds. Anyway, Fallen Earth seemed to fit my criteria. I immediately pre-ordered it via Steam and received head start access on September 10, 2009.The game was developed by an independent company and the game engine is their creation. I like the idea of indies getting out into the mainstream and directly competing against the big boys. I've always been a fan of the underdog. The creators of Fallen Earth have spent a lot of time developing this game and kudos should be given for their perseverance, time, and effort. With that said, the game isn't perfect. But what game is perfect at launch?Starting off, character creation is a mixed bag. The customization available is a bit limited and some of the face templates are the ugliest I've ever seen (well...second ugliest, Age of Conan rates first). You can choose from various facial, arm, and leg tattoos as well as a few horrible hair styles. It's the apocalypse though, so I can forgive not having a lot of hair styles available. Of course if you have time to dye your hair green and spike it, certainly you would have time to get a nice trim. Maybe I'm dwelling too long on hair... Anyhoo, you can choose your own name which is typical, but you are also allowed a space so you can have a last name. This didn't excite me as much, but a friend pointed it out so I figured I'd mention it. It certainly felt refreshing to use a name like Phil McCreviss and giggle to myself constantly as I ran around the countryside. Oh, and you can give your character body hair if you're a male or a belly button piercing if you are a female. This never made much sense to me since these areas will be covered up anyway by clothes you loot or craft. And even if you weren't covered up, I doubt too many people will be admiring your luxurious pelt of body hair.The opening ""noob"" area is a self-contained instance where you are guided through random encounters in order to learn the basic controls. And that's all you get; basic information on how to steer yourself around the game world. It could have definitely gone a little more in depth because as soon as you complete the noob area, you're given various choices on where you would like to go depending on how you want to play the game. I eventually settled on some town but really didn't know what the heck I was doing.Combat isn't what I was expecting. It's clunky and you have to switch back and forth from the standard mouse pointer to ""combat"" stance in order to fight. I really wasn't impressed with this aspect of game play and actually missed the ""auto attack"" that is standard in most MMOs. I don't know why I was thinking that Fallen Earth would have a Battlefield 2 style FPS mixed in with other MMO fare. I'm pretty nave sometimes.Crafting in this game is extensive. If you have ever played EVE Online or Star Wars Galaxies, then you know how these games work in terms of crafting items. I myself never liked crafting. I didn't (and still don't) have the patience or luxury of real time to research what items were needed, where I could get them, where were the highest quality resources to be found, blah blah blah. In Fallen Earth, crafting is a MAJOR aspect of ""game"" play. I put game in quotations because to me, crafting is not very fun. Several quests I had involved crafting and if I couldn't get the right item after killing two dozen creatures looking for random drops, I'd shell out what little cash (poker chips) I had and just bought the ingredients. Crafting is also long and drawn out. If you want to craft a high quality item, it might literally take you a day or more of real time for these things to complete. Luckily you don't have to hang around and wait for the item to finish up as you can just put it in your crafting queue and go about your business. But you can only craft one item at a time, so make sure you have your priorities straight before you start. Being at a specific crafting station will help speed up the process in creating items by shaving off a few minutes or seconds. Crafting takes place when you're not logged in as well. So when you decide to log off for the night, make sure you're at a suitable crafting location (i.e., at an armory when crafting armor) and log off.The various factions and their backgrounds are richly detailed. You have your ""bad guys"" who are loosely allied together, Vista, Children of the Apocalypse (CHOTA), and Travelers. Then you have the ""good guys"" who are loosely allied together, Lightbearers, Enforcers, and Techs. If/when you join a faction; you will gain certain bonuses which are associated with that certain faction. Unfortunately you can't just join a faction right at the beginning which is a bummer and was disappointing. You start off neutral and it's not until later levels that you can actually choose.The major game killer at the moment though is the server-side lag when entering towns or other densely populated areas. Out in the open expanse of the Grand Canyon it's relatively stable, but get more than a few player characters running around in one location, the game's graphics turn into a slide-show. I entered town to turn in a quest and it literally took me 5 minutes to make it through because of the stop-and-go graphics. I even turned down to the lowest graphic setting and there was no change.Another note about this game is that the learning curve is very high. This isn't an MMO which you can jump right into. Some people like that and if that's you, then this is probably a game you would dig. As the days progressed, when I would log-in, I felt like I was going in to work. But after the lag and other items I've talked about, I realized I already have one full time job, I don't need another. I decided to call it quits yesterday and have canceled my subscription.Fallen Earth has potential. The story, lore, and setting are all there. The fact that the developers have an exact topographical representation of the Grand Canyon is impressive and you have to give them credit for trying to create a vast area to explore and raise h-e-double hockey sticks. But bugs abound. Sure, this is typical for any MMO out there. But being an indie company, you need to step up the game and assure people that you can compete with the best out there. Fallen Earth has fallen short in my opinion. Not by much though. I will definitely look back into this game after a couple of months. Like I said before, I enjoy my post-apocalyptic stories so I can't give up all hope on Fallen Earth.",3,Fallen Short...But There's Still Hope For the Future!,1254182400,"09 29, 2009"

Raymond ""firetaz""","[4, 5]","To start things off I'm a huge fan of tactical shooters starting way back with the original Ghost Recon and the two excellent expansions to it ""Island Thunder"" and ""Desert Siege"". I also love the recent Operation Flashpoint games even though they are not as hardcore as the original or ARMA. I never got to play Battlefield 2 for the PC, but recently I been in love with Bad Company 2 which I've heard this game was a lot like it. Battlefield 3 has been splash with the COD sauce, as much as EA and DICE argue that BF3 is something different they have failed.First, the single player campaign. I know the Battlefield series has never had a strong or even a single player mode (PC) but this just plains feels and plays exactly like the Call of Duty series. This isn't a bad thing but Battlefield had the potential to make the single player stand out with large open environments and the use of vehicles. The game did not use what it had best and tried too hard to please the Call of Duty casual player. Everything from the scripted events, ""follow"" icons, fast action scenes, scream COD style. Very linear with the been here done that feel, the sad thing is that in my opinion Modern Warfare has done this better. However, I give DICE credit for not including infinitive respawnding enemies, retarded ""run and duck"" ""no need to shoot a single bullet"" to get through a mission, and the stupid ""magical"" trip wire that activates the next wave of idiots like in Black Ops.Second, the main attraction, its multiplayer. After logging in more than 200 hours of a damn good time with Bad Company 2 and its Vietnam expansion I was sold on BF3. To my surprise though, this follow up suffers from a downgrade in graphics, hit detection, a blue ""tint"", bugs and glitches, no hardcore mode, annoying weapons and gadgets and it goes on. Even after installing the HD pack and downloading the patch BF3 still looks worst than Bad Company 2 and it has an annoying blue tint that makes everything look like your playing with sky blue goggles. Hit detection is very poor, I have been shot point blank and not go down while I have taken them down with a single bullet and vice versa.Why did Dice include Hardcore mode but didn't remove the mini map, icons, and kill camera? Hardcore mode in BC2 was perfect, it made the game a lot more realistic but it's all gone here. Sniping in this game is unbalance, the reflecting lens is overkill as well as the tactical light. Since when does a flashlight blind an enemy on full day light? I have stopped using it because I felt I was getting too many easy kills with it. Destruction, something Dice mention that Frostbite 2.0 was gonna deliver better than Frostbite 1.5 used in BC2. Yet, I feel I have encounter much less destructible buildings and trees compared to BC2. Bringing it home, I could care less about how pretty it looks but I don't understand why they couldn't balance these simple things especially the lack of hardcore mode.If your a new Battlefield player that just started with this I recommend you take a look at the prior Battlefield game released before this, Battlefield Bad Company 2. It has everything that Battlefield 3 has except jets and the prone ability but everything else BC2 does it a hell of a lot better. BF3 is still a good game and I'm sure Dice and EA will continue to improve it with future updates and patches, but right now I regret spending $60 on it. Yet, even with the downgrade feel the multiplayer is still decent compared to the silly multiplayer found in every Call of Duty game.",4,A step down from the superior Battlefield Bad Company 2,1320451200,"11 5, 2011"

9031,85590,AGR4LKC72JEQ8,B000QCU9I0,coopertex,"[0, 0]","Mercenaries 2 is an open world, third person shooter for the XBOX 360. This is the sequel to the sleeper hit, Mercenaries (mercs) that came out with the last gen consoles near the end of their popularity. A lot of its fans claim that the first game was better, but I have to disagree. Also you should be aware that this game is ARCADEY, this is not a realistic game! This is not a simulation like GRAW or RS6 or COD.In Mercenaries, you can pick from three different character mercenaries (mercs) and they each have a unique advantage over the other characters: Mattias, can regenerate health faster than the others, Chris can carry more ammunitions, and Jen can run faster on foot than the others. The storyline, missions and the game's ending however, remains the same for all of the characters regardless of whom you choose to play as.The story is one of its weakest points, but the gameplay more than makes up for it. In the previous Mercs game your character drowned if they went into the water, you couldn't pilot boats and trees were indestructible and impassable. In this sequel, your character can swim on water and even pilot all types of boats! Trees and bushes can be destroyed and are passable with any land vehicle. These are minor improvements but they make the open world experience more enjoyable.The game is open world which means you can go just about anywhere and do about anything you want. You can choose to play campaign missions or side missions by going to any faction that is friendly towards you. The factions are: Universal Petroleum (UP),Venenzuel (VZ), Pirates, PLAV and VZ (whom are always hostile), Allied Nations (AN) and Chinease also become available later into the game.Aside from doing side missions for friendly factions, you can buy weapons from them by going to their shop. You can also take weapons from dead friendlies or enemies that drop them to the ground. There are also bombs and airstrikes which can be found through out the world map (they have unlimited respawns for free!) You can buy vehicles at the shop too, but you also have the option to hi-jack any vehicle in the game; as long as you don't anger a friendly faction.The number of varied vehicles and weapons is enourmous! All the standard stuff are there such as: smgs, rpgs, c4, lmg, grenades, but the airstrikes and the destruction they cause are a sight to behold! Buildings crumble, walls break down, vehicles demolish all in a blaze fire and dust. The explosions and destruction that you can cause is amazing. And best of all you can play co-operatively online with another person!What are the bad points of the game? The game has a lot of little glitches offline, such as floating objects and stupid AI. The major gameplay glitches seem to occur online co-op play which is kind of bad but do not occur all of the time. Hopefully the game's developer will fix these issues with patches. The graphics and animations look like a last gen game and need to be update for a nextgen title.Aside from the glitches, If you like open world gameplay, third person shooters or arcadey gameplay, I do recommend Mercenaries 2 though I think there is lots of room for improvements in the future.Pros:+open world gameplay+two player co-op+destroy just about anything+great explosions+best airstrikes in video game+lots of weapons+lots of vehicles+you can swim and pilot boats+hijack any vehicle+cool side missions+campy humorCons:-cannot fly planes-lots of glitches-no customizable characters-no multiplayer-last gen graphics-weak story-short campaign",4,Destroy Them!,1223596800,"10 10, 2008"

A puzzle game will depend on both the puzzles and the presentation.The PuzzlesIn the opening scene, where you arrive at the studio, take your own picture, and fill out a contestant form, one 3D puzzle is given, where a plant with multicolored leaves must be twisted to find a particular viewpoint where a number can be seen. Shortly thereafter, a set of 12 puzzles is given to you in a Jeopardy format. Solve puzzles until 80 points is scored, with bonuses for not using hints.  The Hint system is excellent, much like the Layton series.  After the game show, host takes you out for a drink, but an FBI agent comes to ask for help with puzzles found at a murder scene. Then there is more back and forth -- gameshow puzzles, crime scene puzzles.  These are good puzzles, and excellently presented.

They get credit in the end titles.The PresentationI was reminded of the DS game Again. Live actors are filmed, and dropped into stylized sets which are made of 2D layers.  The puzzles come about as fast as in the Layton series (and much faster than in 9 Hours). Each time a puzzle is solved in the Show, there is an applause scene, which gets old fast. But otherwise, I thought the stylized version of 1961 was done okay.  The story is still on the thin side, and I finished it in 4 hours.

9044,185851,AGOD8Y5Y37V52,B0050SYLRK,Snake,"[43, 102]","Fanboy reviews aside, there is something seriously wrong with this game. Take this as a heads up, there have literally been 4 separate missions that glitch out and are incapable of completing due to npc's not reacting, my character sinking into the floor, and a quest giver not appearing, requiring you to restart your console. They claim there is a patch, but if you don't have a live account to download that day 1 patch, you can expect clipping issues, glitchy characters and objects separating into mid-air, broken mission objectives, and sync problems. It astounds me to no end that publishers think they can push this crap out with the expectation that they can simply fix it later.In terms of the game, here are some facts, judge them as you will:- Some of the features that have been marketed are misleading- you can't actually ""free run"" through buildings. You look for an open window and he just goes through an animation and you're out the other side, losing pursuers. It is pretty much a fancy, slightly faster version of the hideouts from previous games-There are a LOT of cutscenes. Probably around a 1:1 minute per minute ratio in the first few hours. Expect a lot of talking, an order to ride a horse somewhere, more talking, go run over here, more talking, kill a deer, more talking, go run over there, kill that guy, repeat.- Combat is just about blow-for-blow arkham city's combat system. Two buttons do just about everything, so the entertainment comes from watching him do the moves. Combat is still set up so that everyone circles up around you and take turns getting murdered.- Naval warfare takes up a fair chunk of the game. In my opinion, it's totally awesome and probably the best part of the game (when your ship isn't literally sailing through the port, glitching out of the map)I checked the clock the moment I finally unlocked it. The first time I stepped foot on a ship that I controlled was 8 hours and 24 minutes into the game.-You don't play as a full assassin(white robes and gear) like the previous games until 6-7 hours into the game.I haven't tried multiplayer yet, our internet connection is still out from the storm.

7404,33223,AQMWZIH22R6LE,B00006LELA,"TwistaG ""Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore""","[1, 1]","The original Red Faction came at a time when the PS2 was without a large library of hits.  It also had more hype than a game should legally be entitled to, thanks to the inclusion of the Geo-Mod, a nice piece of code that allowed you to destroy environments as easily as foes.  Therefore, most gamers were able to look past its muddy graphics and underdeveloped story to enjoy it for what it was: a solid single player experience with loads of multiplayer replay value.  The sequel however, has both the name of the original to live up to, and the hundreds of other games on the PS2 market to compete with.  On both fronts, it comes up a little short, but still remains a great game, and worth at least a rental. The graphical prowess of Red Faction 2 is so much higher than that of the original title; that it's hard to believe you're actually playing its sequel.  Explosions are much more intense, textures don't look faded and drab, and the character models, while not exactly what I would call ""fluid"", are certainly leaps and bounds ahead of the almost action-figure type bodies in RF I.  It's obvious that the developers have been tweaking their skills with the PS2 a great deal, and the fruits of their labor are great. The gameplay in the single player is mixed bag of great shoot-em-up action and aching variety.  Dual weapons that can be fired independently of each other are a nice touch, as is the ability to lob grenades with a separate button, ala Halo.  However, the game balance often seems very sloppy: this is evident in the fact that you'll pick up a health kit just as often as ammo, if not more so.  You'll also find yourself using explosive weapons such as rockets, launched grenades, etc.  more often than dual uzis.  This is because while enemies can seemingly take a clip or two of standard bullets before they fall, it only takes one well placed, or even relatively close placed explosive projectile to put them out of their misery.  Add in the fact that they, on the other hand, can tear you to shreds within seconds if given a chance, and the choice becomes clear. It's hard to knock RF2 too low for this quirk, as it seems more like a design choice than a flaw, and what's more, it's one that works: you're given something like 50 explosive shells at the start of every level, and you'll find a large supply of them as you blow more fools into chunks of blood.  You rarely have to use bullets if you don't want to, and it's almost as if bullet-based weapons were viewed more as an obligation than a mechanic originally designed to be included.  This isn't a bad thing, as I had lots of fun always being the man with the rocket launcher in hand, ready to kick [butt].  Some may not enjoy such activities though, preferring ""traditional"" ballistics, so it's something that should be pointed out. Red Faction 2 is a straightforward shooter, and has more in common with Doom or even Serious Sam than it does with Goldeneye or Perfect Dark.  It does, however, sometimes go into the realm of ""awful variety"", including the all too familiar shoot-stuff from-a-helicopter level that is much less fun than an activity of that nature should be.  The only time the variety ever comes close to approaching ""fun"" status is when you take control of the battle armor.  Even then, you'll probably want to get back on foot as soon as possible. For some reason, the multiplayer and bot options from the original just aren't as attractive in the sequel.  It doesn't quite match up to the original in terms of sheer fun factor, partially thanks to the reduction in the Geo-Mod engine.  Much of the fun in the original's multiplayer game came from mutating the environments like a scene from The Matrix.  There's very little of that here, and the experience suffers as a result.  The multiplayer arenas also seem less painstakingly designed, ranging from just about average all the way down to a sloppy mess of hallways and rocket launchers.  If you're buying Red Faction for its multiplayer appeal, don't. Likewise, if you're buying Red Faction for its story, don't.  It's even more clich&eacute;d and convoluted than that of its predecessor.  But unlike the original, you probably won't care in the least about destroying the enemy dictator, nor the ""true"" enemy that eventually reveals himself about a third through the game.

The footage kept getting more and more interesting, but most of the hype had gone away by release day. Honestly, I had always planned on picking up this title, but probably not until I saw it on a sale for 75% off or something along those lines.On the 360, Watch_Dogs doesn't look too bad - the devs over at Ubisoft did a good job toning down the textures and keeping the game looking as good as it does. It obviously doesn't hold a candle to the next-gen systems like the XBox One or PS4, but it's not ugly by any means.That's really the best thing I can say about Watch_Dogs - it doesn't look bad on the 360. Everything else was downhill for me.First off - load times. It was Skyrim all over again. Resetting a mission, failing a mission, quitting a mission - all of these actions take a 15-20 load screen. This doesn't seem half bad until you run into that one mission you can't quite pass and have to reattempt multiple times.It should also be noted that it seems like half the game content is racing based. It seems like you're spending half your time running from the police, running from bad guys, chasing bad guys, etc. Again, this probably wouldn't be quite so bad except that it's almost impossible to get away from chases without specific skills upgrades. Somehow every single cop and bad guy are able to sit on your bumper through miles of traffic and accidents.Quite a few folks have made the GTA comparison - I'm going to compare it to something else, Saints Row IV. There are several aspects of the game play that really feel like they just took SR4 and took the cartoony aspect out. There's minigames dispersed throughout the city, vehicle collecting, random chases, unlocking area towers, and so forth. However what made SR4 fun was that it never took itself seriously. It allowed you to go OP and literally become a comic book superhero. Take that away and you've got Watch_Dogs.Even the hacking aspect feels forced and quite often - useless. I had initially thought that the game was meant to be played similar to the Splinter Cell series. Stealth 90% of the time, kill only when you have no other option. There's literally no downside to going through and massacring every enemy in the game. In fact, it's often easier to head shot every guard instead of parkouring yourself into a position to hop from security camera to security camera in order to explode a fuse box.If the game was fun to play - even the killing aspect could be overlooked. It might be one of those things you bookmark for later - go through the first play-through on easy mode, killing everyone in sight, and on the second play, do everything hard, don't kill anyone. Honestly, I don't know if I'll even finish the first play.",2,Feels like a Saints Row IV clone with less fun - also a load-fest on the 360,1404000000,"06 29, 2014"

He can only come out by entering an arena and completing four separate tasks (mini-games).Some of the games are slinging a cow by a chain like a shotput, slamming outhouse doors with bunnies inside pinching a loaf (if they get scared by lack of privacy, they shoot you in the face with a plunger). Another has you on a beachside juice bar, and you have to fill up their scuba masks with a spray of carrot juice before they advance on you. Yet another has bunnies twirling towards you on a rock stage, and you have to hit a button as they walk over a star (Then a bunny joins you as a backup dancer! CUTE!)This has a tiny bit of shock value from its weirdness, but noone that sends their young children to ANY animated kids movie made in the last 5 years has anything to fear, as theres less toilet humor in this game than any of those so-called ""children's movies"".I give it 4 stars, only because its not exactly a game I would like to play very much at the age of 36, but still fun & a GREAT party game for kids, adults, or a mix of both. Fast rounds and therefore all the impatient kids can get a quick turn if they each complete a round.

The multiplayer online is where you'll spend all your time. Unlocking weapons and gadgets will keep you playing at least 50 hours and lots of people will play this game several hundred hours. The online is supposed to be random matchmaking, and it's one of the most competitive games out there, so you have to expect to get beat up on for the first 20 hours or so. My brother quit playing online because he found it too competitive. It's really not for the feint of heart. My only real gripes about the game is that there are a lot of invisible walls. You'll say to yourself ""I can run up this mound of boulders and do some sniping"" and then you'll find it's not actually a scalable surface, that an invisibile wall blocks your path. Sometimes this happens even when the surface isn't steep so it doesn't make any sense. Likewise, there are surfaces you expect to be able to climb up on, but the game doesn't let you, again somewhat randomly, so inevitably you get knifed in the back while you're jumping up and down like a doofus. In this sense games like battlefield are better inasmuch as you can climb any surface unless it's just too steep.

My theory is that their developers have secret access to a mysterious element called Happy, which they tuck into the microchip before shipping the game. This causes the strange effect of players not being able to cease smiling as they play the game. I have fallen under the effects of Happy, and here's why.I loved the look of this game. Clear, sharp, and colorful, with gorgeous animation. I highly reccomend that you play it on a DS or GBA SP, as the extra light heightens the graphics to glorious levels.The battle system is wonderful. You may not be able to believe that the superb Paper Mario combat system would translate well to a handheld, but ah, how wrong you'd be. Timing the button presses takes concentration, but is never frustrating or boring. You can use hammers, jumps, or even magical powers to attack, as well as an array of fun items.Then there are the puzzles. This is where the Happy element is in its strongest form. As you progress in the game, you'll earn new abilities, and each and every one will help you solve the near-perfect puzzles. Use your hammer to whack the brother in front of you into the ground...light your partner's pants on fire to make him dash...or jump on his head to reach a high ledge. Whatever it is you have to do, it always makes sense. For this reason, I would reccomend playing without a strategy guide, since using one would ruin the fun of figuring the puzzles out.The story, which is beautiful in its simplicity, has many twists and turns, so you never know what you might be doing next. One minute you could be hunting for beans to make Yoshis lay eggs, and the next you might be strategically using your hammer to help a fashion designer dye her clothes. This keeps the game fresh and exciting at every turn.RPG elements are integrated masterfully. You can gain experience, level up, and even buy new equipment. These features add to the game, but never become a pain.From the beginning, which features Mario running around in his underwear, to the end sequence, wherein Bowser is tied to the back of a plane in a gigantic gift box, this game is pure joy. So play it already. Feel the Happy.",5,Pure joy,1112313600,"04 1, 2005"

8243,375,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00000DMAQ,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Banjo-Kazooie is a strange platformer, but ultimately misses the mark in all key areas of being entertaining.  It tries to be funny without actually being exciting to play.  All the attention on humor and yet, the game itself is hardly ever fun.  This means children would probaly be able to overlook the games flaws and focus on the humor, which I'm sure was Nintendo's intentions- to market the game for kids and assume they wouldn't be able to detect the lousy game design.  I guess the Nintendo 64 struggling to make a profit at the time meant Nintendo had to do absolutely anything to try and get *any* type of crowd interested in their products despite the poor quality we're forced to persevere, so that explains Banjo Kazooie's existence.Anyway, Banjo-Kazooie is basically nothing but an item-collecting quest with graphics that are admittedly prettier and just better than 90% of the stuff the N64 was pumping out at the time.  The waters, grassy lands, mountains... everything is a beautiful sight to behold with crystal clear authentically pleasing environments.  But seriously, why am I basically doing nothing but walking around collecting items the entire time?  If you think ""That's what ALL platformers do!"" guess again: many of them focus on exciting enemy variety, diverse surroundings and a gradual increase in challenge which this game sorely lacks.  The only challenge is to avoid falling from high narrow platforms while collecting musical notes- these are dirty tricks and artificial challenges.  I found sharks you have to swim away from, crabs you can stomp on top of, and weird gigantic green enemies that come out of walls while you're trying to make your way across high paths without falling.  These enemies only appear like 10% of the time- the rest of your surroundings aren't very threatening.Let's see all the things you have to collect.  Honeycomb pieces, jiggy pieces (mandatory to open entrances to new locations and you need to obtain a certain number of them per world), 100 musical notes which is a total ripoff of Super Mario 64 with the 100 coins needed to get a star, mumbo tokens used to cast spells, and jinjo tokens used to win vehicle parts.  You can turn into animals and insects which is somewhat satisfying for the sake of seeing the occasional brief moments of diversity, but otherwise nothing to get really excited about.  Often you have to climb trees to reach the items on top and it gets boring after a while, believe me.Oh and the game is a victim of underwater tragedies- you're constantly adjusting the camera for a more appropriate angle but finding that it's much harder than it needs to be.  I will never understand why Nintendo refuses to fix water portions in 3D platform gaming.  It's mind-boggling.  They didn't even fix them in Super Mario Galaxy 2, a game released a good 10 years after Banjo-Kazooie.  The characters are all forgettable, including the ponytail-sporting female bear and Banjo himself.  Kazooie the bird is probably the only tolerable one of the bunch.Whereas the Mario series can be enjoyed by kids and adults respectively, Banjo-Kazooie is certainly intended solely for children and no other age group.  It's too shallow of a game overall to satisfy adult gamers.  Banjo-Kazooie is like walking into the nicest looking restaurant in town and everything is great except for one thing- you get a small quantity of food so you ask yourself ""Is it worth my time to return here again?""",2,banjo kapooie,1376265600,"08 12, 2013"

Horror games tend to be on the atmospheric side of things, the type of games that work plot and character more than anything else. Some of the best ones build up a creeping feeling of dread, plucking at both your heartstrings and the darkest corners of your mind. They can be subtle and psychological. But of course not every Horror title needs function as such. A game can be in your face and bloody as hell and still send you into fear induced panic. When I think Survival Horror I think of exploring the mist swept roads of Silent Hill. I think of running from the Howlers in Undying. I think of racing through the police station in Resident Evil 2.I do not, however, think of a man literally screaming his face off while turning into a space zombie.If I could describe Dead Space 2 (and it's predecessor for that matter) in one phrase, it'd be ""trying too hard"". Dead Space 2 pushes it's horror elements and it's gore so hard that it comes across as comical. Which would be fine in, say, Resident Evil or Evil Dead: Fist Full of Boomstick, games that incorporate giggles with their guts, but in a game like this that's desperately trying to be taken seriously it just made me laugh. Not that the ""horror"" was the only that had me rolling, but we'll get to that later. Maybe if the game was intentionally a bit sillier then this could work. Mixing humor and horror can just as unsettling as straight up horror. But going so far over the top as to make the lawnmower scene from Brain Dead look tame and still trying to be serious just engenders your title towards unintentional comedy (which is never a good sign).  Of course, any attempts at horror (comedic or otherwise) die a slow painful death when the scares are as predictable, cheap, and telegraphed as they are in Dead Space 2.The final nails the space coffin that is this games' attempts at horror are it's plot and characters. In the first game the plot was a blatant ripoff of Event Horizon and the characters were idiots (except for Issac, who was an unrelateable robot). Here, the characters are cheap, action movie stock characters who only exist to spout out cliche dialogue and the plot is a complete shambles. Every new plot point brought either giggles or groans from me as the game chugged along, desperately trying to get me to take it seriously. Honestly, this whole Church of Unitology thing was kinda interesting in Dead Space One, but here they're so blatantly evil and so completely moronic that they make Emperor Palpatine look subtle and Doctor Evil look intelligent. The major villains in your horror game should not make me laugh every time they speak. Oh, and every time the game tries to pluck my heartstrings with images like blood soaked schools and zombie babies, the scenes breakdown due to their own internal contradictions.Game play wise, Dead Space 2 is fairly good, if a bit formulaic. It is nice to see a game that is (essentially) a third person shooter no have regenerating health or a cover system. Add into that the sheer wealth of weapon and item options and a very well implemented menu system and you would have the makings of a great shooter. Well, you would if the enemy AI was smarter than a damp sponge and the monsters weren't so pathetically easy to kill. On the highest difficulty settings. It'd also help if the weapons weren't so over powered, but now I may just be nit picking.All in all, Dead Space 2 has enough great ideas to be great third person shooter, but it's idiotic plot, shallow attempts at horror, crap AI and predictable design delegate a place in the bargain bin.",2,Where Has All the Horror Gone?,1299196800,"03 4, 2011"

I also played a year ago Dante's Inferno and Darksiders. I have War in the North, Fable, Batman AA/AC and Warhammer 40K Spacemarine. I mention this games because they share a common characteristics: They are Hack & Slash and/or Button mashers, so you can't say I don't have experience in the field of H&S;/BMNow... the game.The good:* Graphics are beautifull, blah blah blah. You already read it in all the other reviews and I agree. The environments are really beautifull and make you wish you could explore them with more detail (but you can't. More on this later)* The voice acting is good, could be better but could but it could be worse.The Bad.* Combat System: NO, is not that good (IMO) When I started to play, I expected a solid experience like Bayonetta or Dante. How disappointed I was, someone mentioned ""Acrobatic combat"" Well NO. ""Prince of persia: Two thrones"" was the most acrobatic and solid combat system I ever played and this is nowhere near that. Even Warhammer 40K Space marine, which is a mix between a 3rd person shooter and a H&S;, has much better combat mechanics than this game.* The dodge mechanic sucks: you can't perform 2+ immediate dodges one after another a la Bayoneta nor you move a great distance away like in Dante, so if you timed wrongly you can't escape the enemie's attack. Also, in other games, once you dodge, you can move immediatelly but in Castlevania LoS (CLoS from now on) I felt that after the dodge (you roll) there is a small window of like 1 second when you're vulnerable. If you roll into some enemies they're pushed back, but if you roll and land in front of them... well you're screwed (At least that's how I felt it)* The combos:Can be interrupted by the very monster you're attacking. I was fightnig a big spider (not a boss, just some overfeed spider)and I was performing my shortest combo (X-X-X) and the damned spider jumped at me and hit me! Same happened with big wolves. Why does this upset me? Because in other games once you started the combo you can finish it! In CLoS, You can't. In other games, Every time you land a hit, the enemy is stunned for fractions of a second allowing you to continue the combo untill you finish it or YOU interrupt it by dodging another enemy's attack or you're interrupted by ANOTHER enemy's attack. In CLoS, I found that the enemies that are strong enough to hold a 3button combo do not even flinch when you hit them and they are able to attack you in any moment during your button sequence. My solution? X-X-Dodge, Dodge-Dodge, X-X-Dodge... no combos and no fun.* The attack hint:What do I men by this? When a medium size enemy is about to perform an attack, you have a very distinctive animation. They're somewhat easy to see when you're not doing anything, but whne you're performing a combo (IMO) you need something else that lets you know the enemy is about to attack you! Specially if the enemy is oblivious to your attacks (read the previous point)* The block mechanic:CLoS has an ability that works like this: If you block an enemy attack inside a certain time frame (When they announce your attack and before they land it) then a small animation will trigger and you will do aditional damage. Sadly, I can't seem to perform this movement often enough because the enemies Attack-Hint is not clear enough or because the Block ... sux! I do not feel the character blocks as soon as I press my trigger. Simple as that. Bayonetta has a simmilar mechanic: when you dodge in time then time slows down by a couple of seconds and you know what? I perform it quite often because the game's response to my trigger is immediate. CLoS? Not so much, most of the time I end up being hit and decided to give up this ability.* The button mashing:As far as I advanced, the button mashing was reduced to situations where you needed to escape from an enemy's embrace. (Spiders jumping onto you or entangling you with they web) The first was easy to address, but the second? GOD!!!!!I mentioned Asura's Wrath earlier because that is a QTE-ButtonMash type of game and if I did learned something with that game was to mash my buttons. But in CLoS, when I'm captured by a spider's web, it doesn't matter how fast I press my button I can't get myself free! and I press it so fast that my thumb becomes a blur.* The Camera&lt;sighs> Most of the time it works, but there are times when the game performs a change of angle (when you go from one area to another) and the movement screws. This is a little annoyance but one that I need to mention because it IS annoying. Is one of those little things that makes you upset every time they happen. As I mentioned before, the environments are beautiful but you can't appreciate them that much because the camera is FIXED!I did not enjoyed what little I played from this game. It frustrated me and I found myself constantly comparing how better I felt Bayonetta and Dante's Inferno handled the very same things.

My head almost exploded with the amount of detail.  Well worth the wait.  The realistic physics and environmental detail is just phenomenal.-- Good graphics.-- Realistic vehicle mechanics, even though they suck from a game playing standpoint.-- A lot of content.  Many missions, side missions; will keep you busy for hours.-- It's GTA!  Mowing down pedestrians with a dump truck should bring a smile to everyone's face!-- City is huge.-- GPS is such a major addition, I can't stress it enough.  I'd love to replay San Andreas and Vice City but they both lack GPS thus forcing me to memorize or lookup the streets...thanks but no thanks.CONS-- A lack of checkpoints makes this game almost...almost, unplayable.  I don't mind if a mission takes 8 minutes to complete, but don't make me repeat the same 4 minute banal driving route when I fail the final shootout.-- Game is too long (due in part to the lack of checkpoints!).  I'm 50% of the way through the game and already on hour 40.-- Friends feature is brutal and pointless.  Friend calls me to go to the bar, I agree.  I have one game hour to pick him up but I find out AFTER agreeing to hang out, that he's 2 game hours away!  Pick up friend, get grief for being late.  Drive to the bar and drink.  Get out of the bar and wait 5 minutes to sober up.  Then I have to drive my friend to wherever he wants to be dropped off.  12 minutes of my life wasted.  Rinse and repeat.  Friend never meets you at an activity, you have to drive him/her EVERYTIME! I still have yet to see the benefit of maintaining positive relationships.-- Way way WAY too much driving.  You are EVERYONE'S personal chauffer.  70% of the game is driving!  I'll buy some crappy NASCAR game if I want to drive.  Still waiting for a mission where I'm shooting out of a moving car as a passenger.-- Shooting while driving is impossible.  Seriously, there has to be a better way to implement this.-- Camera angle needs to be permanently adjustable.  There are multiple camera views but I like to scan the road ahead of me.  The game resets the camera position if I'm not actively adjusting it.  One thumb drives while the other thumb adjusts and holds the camera angle.  Annoying.-- Money is pointless.  I have $300K banked and nothing to spend it on.-- You are everyone's lackey!  Everyone talks down to you.  Humbling at first but now annoying.-- Missions add little to the main story line.  Half of the mission-givers die anyways, the rest become friends which you want nothing to do with when they call.It's almost like Rockstar focused all their resources in the details and simply forgot to appropriately handle the major items.  I'm 50% of the way through this game and debating if I want to finish the rest of it.  Replay value seems low.  The bottom line is a game is suppose to be fun and this one isn't; it's become more of a chore than anything.  Not what I've come to expect from Rockstar.

They were one of several companies who released several arcade classics during its hey day and many of them have been ported over to several gaming consoles including the NES and Genesis systems. When word came out that they were doing a compilation of some of their best games, I was excited. So here's how this compilation breaks down:- 15 classic arcade titles from the early 1980s to the mid 1990s ranging from shooters, racing, side scrollers, puzzle, sports and a light RPG.- In game achievement system where you earn medals for completing various objectives within the individual titles.- Earning medals unlocks additional content like a hard difficulty mode, arcade banners, original posters/ads and the ability to play individual music tracks from all of the titles.- 2 player co op support for most titles; some let you alternate between players while high scores are saved on your Wii memory. You can also attach your Miis to your high scores as well.THE GOOD: All 15 arcade titles are exact copies of what you played while standing in front of the cabinet. Of the top, you will recognize half of these games. The in-game achievements motivate you to unlock the extra content. 2 player support means you can play these games with your friends anytime. The compilation supports the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, the Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro and the Gamecube controller. And the obvious benefit: no quarters needed! :PTHE BAD: This compilation offers a very, bland presentation. Intro and select menus are very basic and feel like the design was done at the last minute. Once you unlock all the features, that's it; don't expect to find hidden games. As I stated before, you'll immediately recognize half of the games (Bad Dudes, Caveman Ninja, Burgertime, Heavy Barrel, Magical Drop III and Secret Agent AKA Sly Spy) the others aren't so well known and not that great (Burnin' Rubber, Lock'n' Chase and Side Pocket should have been left off.) Forget about their arcade titles based on licensed products because of their potential legal issues, you won't find them here (Robocop, The Real Ghostbusters and Captain America and the Avengers come to mind.)Data East has produced many arcade games so it remains to be seen if they will release a second compilation. I guess that depends of how well this compilation sells. If you loved arcade games of the past and you liked the games from Data East in particular, go out and buy this.

I'd heard it was insanely difficult and had no save game feature, which was true. However, the Gold version has a save anywhere feature that comes in really handy! The graphics are somewhat dated by today's standards, but the engine they used (Lithtech I think, but I could be wrong; I'm guessing by the look) was very imaginatively utilized, resulting in some really beautiful levels. I mean you feel like you're in the movie. Level one is mostly indoors, but level two gets you outside into a really beautiful bluish-tinted and rainy area. Very moody! I've only had experience playing as the marine, and I'm only on the second level, so you'll have to take that into account when you read this. You start out in a room, and the first thing you notice is someone is talking to you. Turns out it's a commanding officer talking through a video-phone on the wall. This feature is superbly used, as your friend keeps you up to date on your situation as you progress, and you can see him and hear him talking to you at various points. It doesn't sound like much, I know, but after some extended 'alone' time, running into one of these monitors and seeing and hearing your commanding officer again is a huge relief to your lonliness. It's a phychological thing mostly, but it really works. And I'm not sure how they did it, but they flawlessly incorporated these full-motion video scenes into the engine (into small screens on the walls and at computer stations) so it looks perfectly natural. After exploring a bit, I discovered another huge aid: The Image Intensifier. You'll use this a lot in darker areas, and once again, the makers did a fantastic job of making this effect look just like you'd think an image intensifier should look. Also, there's a motion tracker, just like in the movie, which lets you know where the aliens are. Just hearing that beep is enough to raise gooseflesh, without even seeing anything! The first alien I ran into was totally unexpected, and I about fell out of my chair when it came at me. The developers did a fine job of creating the beasts! The surroundings are surreal, and will cause your imagination to run wild. Sound effects are first-rate too, especially the ambient sounds, and they are positional, meaning if they're to the left, you'll hear them from your left speaker. This is possibly the scariest game I have ever played. That honor used to go to the &quot;Thief&quot; games, but those games used more tension-filled fear than true, gut-level nightmare-type fear.The box gives a Pentium 200 as minimum and recommends a PII 400, but I installed it on my PII 266 (with 96 MB ram and a Voodoo 2 video card) and it ran absolutely smoothly at full detail. I also installed it on a PII 450 with 256 MB ram and a first generation NVidia TNT 1 video card, and it performs flawlessly there too. It is one of the smoothest-performing games I own. Sure, it's a couple years old, but it looks great, and is sure to become one of those classics you'll be looking for later if you don't get it now. Also, I highly recommend playing this with all the lights off, and at night. And not because of the mood (though playing in the dark will certainly enhance the mood). I recommend playing in darkness more because if there's any kind of light glaring on your screen, you won't be able to see well. This is a very dark game, and I've found that at night with all lights off, you can see all you need to. But don't forget to use the Image Intensifier--you'll need it in places.

When you glance at it, it looks fine, but why must there be buttons up and down the system -- with features that could just as easily be on a menu screen? And why is the system so fragile? And, lastly, why doesn't it work? I inserted a disc into the first PSP I bought and the machine spit it out, shattering the disc. I exchanged the game and the PSP, went home and experienced the DREADED dead pixels. With two broken PSPs, I decided to cut my losses (since I can't return the game) and return the system. The PSP did have potential, but it turned out all wrong. If Sony wanted it to work as an iPod, they should have included a bigger memory card. Does anyone feel like paying another $150.00 for memory, after paying $250.00 for a console? If Sony wanted to make a portable system, they should have gone with cartridges or flash memory (something the Nintendo DS got right). If they wanted it to play movies (the most unneeded feature ever seen in a portable GAMING system) -- they should gotten out of the gaming business and went into selling portable DVD players (bigger screens, better picture and they play the DVDs you already own). The proprietary game and movie discs -- which are grossly overpriced (the movies have no extras, the games are $20.00 more than DS or GBA games) -- burn the batteries out FAST. I played for just over 2 and a half hours when the batteries died (the pixels were dead from the beginning). Sony -- when are you going to get some quality control folks at HQ?!? A quarter of the PS2's first released were broken (including the first one I bought). The PSP is deja vu all over again. I'd like to say the Nintendo DS is a nice alternative, but with its HORRIBLE ergonomics (holding it with your left hand while trying to use the stylus with your right becomes painful after a few minutes) and lack of decent games, I just can't. Right now, I'd say hold off on both systems and stick to the Gameboy Advance. If you feel you MUST own a new handheld, I'd take the DS over the PSP, being that they both pretty much suck, but at least the DS is durable and isn't broken out of the box (and is $100.00 cheaper and $20.00 less per game title). Plus, the stylus on the DS makes for incredibly fun gameplay (when done right, which it rarely is) -- if you can handle the pain you'll be feeling in your hands and arms, after a few minutes. For comfort, I would have to give the PSP a higher rating than I'd give the DS. It wasn't bad to hold onto. If it actually worked and had some decent titles, it may even be a keeper. As things are, I'd say wait until November, when the new GameBoy comes out (rumor has it it will be able to play GameCube games directly) and pick one up. If you're still set on buying a PSP, I'd wait a few more months, until Sony gets them working properly. By that point, the price will have also dropped (I'm guessing they'll be $149.99 to compete with the next GameBoy's $99.99 price tag in November).",1,This handheld is horrible ...,1114128000,"04 22, 2005"

It is a good demonstration of XBox technology and very little else.The game centers around a set of missions that put you against the Japanese mafia.  The missions involve racing around a city and usually involve destroying something using your car (other cars, dim sum stands, etc).  Missions are timed and you must complete sets of missions to advance.  Completing missions unlocks new cars as well.  All in all, the missions are diverse but aren't interesting enough to keep you playing.The cars themselves aren't particularly easy to drive.  They tend to have a lot of oversteer, meaning it is very easy to loose control of the back of the car.  Weaving in and out of traffic at high speed is almost impossible with some of the vehicles.  A bit of understeer and better sliding ability would make the driving aspect of the game much more enjoyable.The major upside to this game are the graphics.  They are just amazing.  It is worth renting this game just for a few days of eye candy.Also, the destructability of the city is very impressive.

Unfortunately it did not.When I opened the box I was extremely impressed with the controller. It looks great and is a lot of fun to play around with. This set my expectations pretty high since I don't really find the guitar hero controller very fun to play around with without the game. The controller gives you a good feel of what a basic DJ turntable is like and the Xbox controls are discretely hidden. So from a hardware perspective DJ Hero is impressive.The problem with the game is the gameplay itself. The game is hard to figure out even with the tutorial and was surprisingly boring once I managed to figure it out. The turntable only has three buttons and is pretty boring even with the scratch feature, something I thought would be pretty cool.The game is pretty pricey and is not really worth the money. The controller is pretty nice though and it shows that the game has potential. Unfortunately for us we'll have to wait for DJ Hero 2 to see the full potential of the controller.

However, the bulk of the freakiness at the beginning of the game is the fog and not being able to see the monster until you get a bit closer. It's the typical bash the ghost with objects, guns,... blah blah blah.

Neither of these prospects is easy to do. To upgrade your house, you need bells (money) and to make money, you need to gather anything and everything and sell it to Tom Nook. But unfortunately, due to your pocket size, you'll only make on average 1500 bells per gathering excursion. You have 19,000 bells of your first mortgage to pay off and then, after Tom Nook upgrades your house, you'll owe something like 120,000 bells! That's hours of gathering and well...that's not my idea of fun.The museum collection is interesting. You do feel compelled to donate fossils, fish, insects, and paintings to the museum. Unfortunately, this is no small task. One of the games more interesting designs is that it takes into consideration time and date on what kind of things ""spawn"" in your town. So, if this is a main goal of the game, you need to play for at least one year and at different times during the day to collect everything.This game reminds me a bit of World of Warcraft. You're constantly trying to make as much money as possible and get the next new thing. But there's always something better, something more, and you just keeping playing and playing. In the end, you're really not getting anywhere. I am not impressed with this game, but I'm still playing it. Perhaps the one endearing quality of this game.

One big addition for me, since I am not the best player, is the addition to select all FIGHT-ABLE units with the F2 key and put them to a hotkey. A big problem I had in the first game was that if I had all my buildings ralleyed to a certain unit and that unit dies during battle, as I make more re-enforcements, they would not come but rather just stay right where the production building is. With the new feature in HOTS I can press F2, shift+1, and do an attack command and all units will move out and join the fight.The new units are also a big plus. The swarm host makes Zerg able to hold down an enemy who may be turtling or contain them and the Protoss units are an awesome addition.

Thinking it would make a great supplemental tool, I snatched up My Japanese Coach without looking up the reviews in advance.  Trust me when I say this will never happen again.  Going through the first 29 lessons of this learning game, you get a clear picture of what to expect from the remaining 71.With the help of a kimono-clad virtual host, you learn various Japanese words and phrases through sound, speech and writing while testing your knowledge in a growing number of minigames.  Mastering words in the minigames unlock the next lesson, a real detriment for those with advanced knowledge of the language.  Another problem with MJC is that it starts off teaching random words and doesn't even cover 'kana,' or Japanese characters, and writing them until Lesson 6, as though assuming the player has some grasp of Japanese.  Speaking of writing, a little experimentation confirms that MJC has issues with the stroke order of kana.  And MJC's point system makes it so you can  grind with the minigames and unlock each lesson while you hardly learn anything.  If that's not enough to dissuade you, the main game's so dependent on the romanization of the language that the player becomes dependent on it too.I can honestly say from personal experience that one can learn more from the most boring, underfunded college language course than from MJC.  Of course, no video game can truly supplement real-world learning.  With a built-in dictionary and phrasebook included in the game, I still recommend it if only to build up your vocabulary.This review will be revised with further testing of the product.This game is rated E for Everyone.",3,Kono to Sono (This and That),1274140800,"05 18, 2010"

There's no global strategy.What WOW did was take existing technology and implement it better.  You get quests, just like other games of this type, but WOW quests are bigger, better and much, much more plentiful.  I have leveled from 1 to 60 and always had multiple quests waiting to be done.  I had to skip a number of them -- by the time you've done most of the quests, you're ready to move to a higher level area, meaning some quests will still be new to you if you level a second character.  There are combat skills and spells, just like other games of this type, but WOW has more of them with more tactical options that really gives you something to think about as you fight your way to the top.  There are dungeons, just like other games of this type, but WOW dungeons range from ""medium"" to ""superhuge"".  Other games have loot, WOW has more loot, with more variety, meaning less of a huge gap between the ""haves"" and ""have nots"".Etc.  WOW doesn't do anything really new, it just took what the genre already had and made it all better.2) PvPPlayer versus player action is optional but I recommend giving it a shot.  Normal servers have 100% consensual PvP.  You must do something specific before you can attack or be attacked.  PvP servers have it opened up by dividing the world into three types of areas: Horde, Alliance and Contested.In a Horde zone, Alliance can be attacked at will but they cannot fire until fired upon.  Vice versa for Alliance zones.  These are basically the lowest level zones, from around level 1-20 or so.  You can get your feet planted and learn your class and get some abilities before you have to worry about being attacked.Contested zones are ""team PvP"".  Horde and Alliance can attack each other on sight.  You cannot attack your own team (except in special Arenas).  There are no level limits -- a level 60 can squish a level 30 if they are both in a contested zone.However, unlike many other PvP games, level differences are diluted.  The level 30 will not be completely helpless.  Though his weapons and spells will do much less damage and he will be physically weaker, he can at least fight enough that a level 60 facing a group of level 30's will be facing a likely death -- death by pinpricks, but they can definately impact him.  My secondary character is a Warlock, and at level 26 my ""Fear"" spell works pretty well even against level 60's.  They show up to murder me for a free win because I'm so small and feeble, they think again as I cast Fear on them, which sends them running away uncontrollably as I high-tail it in the other direction and hide behind a tree.3) Blizzard's ""no tollerance"" policy.Sony Online Entertainment is notorius for allowing hackers and cheaters and troublemakers to continue to play the game.  Blizzard is notorius for banning them from the field.  This is excellent.  As with any game, hacks and cheats get made and discovered, but Blizzard is quick to find these people and suspend their accounts.Like a good referee, Blizzard keeps the game fair for honost players and I appreciate that as much as any technical aspect of the game.I can't say enough good about it, this game rocks, it's by far the best MMORPG yet.We can quibble over the graphical style, class balance or ""lag"", but issues like that are almost immaterial.  MMORPG's all update, graphics change, class balance changes, lag issues come and go, it's the same from UO to EQ2.  The important thing is that the design is solid, the content is solid, the mechanics are solid, WOW is going to be the game to play for the forseeable future.

This game simply doesn't cut it. It's crystal clear now why Treyarch's past CoD titles were console-only.Everything that was great about Infinity Ward'sCall of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Game of the Yearis missing from Treyarch's console port, ""World at War"". In fact, it's clear to me that the only reason this game was listed as a Call of Duty title was to capitalize on the success of Modern Warfare. At least for the PC, WaW doesn't compare in any significant way to the rest of the franchise.I understand that Modern Warfare's fictional storyline could be made more compelling than one (WWII) where we already know the ending, but that hardly explains the discrepancies between these two Call of Duty titles. WaW is just barely playable - marginally better and only slightly more imaginative than the doomedMedal of Honor Pacific Assault: Director's Edition(now going for a whopping $3.50) and its even worse subsequent MoH effort,Medal of Honor Airborne. The user interface control is cumbersome (at best) and the game play is barely above boring. At several points in the game the script programming is buggy, and without online walkthroughs, many, many customers have found it impossible to get through to the end of the game (the Reichstag steps bug, where the Russian commander gets 'stuck' in a location on the map).It's not clear to me why, as the available technology gets better, combat FPSes generally seem to be getting more and more mediocre, with a few exceptions like Crysis... and Modern Warfare, which is arguably the best of the entire Call of Duty series. Are game designers more interested in making a splash at E3 with graphics, bells and whistles than they are in capitalizing on what makes games like Modern Warfare (and the originalMedal of Honor: Allied Assault) so playable and popular with consumers? Spellbinding graphics and gameplay gimmicks (night jumps, ""affordances"", weapons 'upgrades', squad control, etc.) seem to be creeping into all these games with no real improvement in the areas that make them fun and, just as importantly, popular for online multiplayer, which is where they see their longevity. Even Activision continues to miss the boat on usable mapping and modding tools - something they could easily market and profit from if they had the interests of their customers at heart (those tools are already developed and lack only a decent user interface and some documentation - much of which already exists in the public domain). Instead of abandoning customers and expecting them to buy a new version of the game every year or so, why not try supporting the games (the good ones) with expansions, mapping/modding tools and resources, etc.?I'm very anxiously awaiting Call of Duty / Modern Warfare 2, announced by Activision on 12/3. I very much hope it uses the same excellent game engine, and that they don't waste resources developing a new one from scratch (as they obviously have done with WaW).If we never see another attempt by Treyarch to contribute to the Call of Duty franchise on the PC, that'll be just fine. If Activision wants Treyarch to develop console games for them, great - have them stick to consoles.

12032,211613,A3IVAJOW2BP5DT,B009AGXH64,Anonymous,"[1, 2]","Despite anything you may hear or read the Wii U is actually a decent gaming system.  It expands upon the original Wii with a lot of new features and better graphics.  The controller pad is innovative and in line with current handheld tablets.  And there are lots of good - even great - games available for it, such as Super Mario 3D World, Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and New Super Mario Bros. U.Having said that, the Wii U may very well be the system that permanently sets Nintendo behind XBox and PlayStation in the gaming wars.  And it has absolutely nothing to do with competition from phone/tablet gaming applications as some will have you believe.  The successful launches of both XBox One and PlayStation 4 dispel that notion.  When it's all said and done, the following will be the reasons why the Wii U ultimately failed:Bad Name & Terrible MarketingLackluster Launch TitlesLack of Third-Party DevelopersNo ""Luxury"" Additions (i.e. Blu-Ray Player)PS4 and XBox One - simply put - are better systemsWith regards to the name and marketing, it was a mistake for Nintendo to connect this system to the original Wii in my opinion.  While the Wii was innovative and a more family-friendly option than its counterparts, it was basically a joke among hardcore gamers mostly because the games couldn't compete graphically with XBox 360 and PS3.  Further, Wii games sold terribly outside the Nintendo mainstays (such as the aforementioned Mario and Zelda titles), with the exception of Wii Sports, which had more to do with the gimmicky nature of it than how good the game actually was (not to mention the fact it was bundled with the Wii).  And within a couple of years of the Wii's launch XBox and PlayStation had already stolen the motion-sensor concept, which made the Wii less viable and unique.  The Wii was a fun little system couples and families bought, played for a few weeks or months, and then watched it collect dust on their entertainment center.  Making a sequel to a system that had pretty much lost all its luster by the time the Wii U launched demonstrates Nintendo lacked perception in how inadequate the Wii was for gamers.*Now before many of you throw out that the Wii was the most successful system of its generation, I am fully aware of that.  My point is that the Wii had a broad but gimmicky appeal that quickly dissipated by the time the Wii U launched, and Nintendo couldn't figure out a way to properly convey to people the differences and improvements between the Wii and Wii U.  And again, while the system itself sold well, Wii games mostly didn't.With regards to the launch titles...that was just a case of Nintendo trying to jump the gun on the XBO and PS4 and launching the Wii U a full year ahead of the competition when it might not have been ready.  It wound up being shortsighted because I think all it did was amp the anticipation for the competition. The lack of third party developers is just how Nintendo does business, and something that probably won't change with the Wii U.Now, with regards to a lack of Blu-Ray player...look, I understand that streaming is the future of television, and disc players are going the way of the dinosaur and Blockbuster Video.  But as expensive as these systems are - especially at the onset - you have to provide customers a side luxury outside of gaming, especially since Nintendo's reputation amongst gamers has faded.  It doesn't HAVE TO be a Blu-Ray player, but at least a Blu-Ray Player is SOMETHING that the competition offers that Nintendo doesn't.The bottom line to all of this, however, is that the XBox One and PS4 are just better systems, and can do way more than the Wii U can.  This was the case with the Wii versus the XBox 360 and PS3.  The only real reason to buy a Wii U is to be able to play Mario and Zelda games.  But that's just not a big enough carrot to dangle in front of gamers anymore, especially gamers who have ""graduated"" from Mario.  And it's not enough for the casual gamers who bought the Wii - the same casual gamers who eventually got bored with that system fast and can't really see the incentive in upgrading to the Wii U especially when the competition offers everything the Wii U does and more for just slightly more money.Despite all of this, however, I'm a Nintendo fan and believe the Wii U is actually a strong improvement over the Wii.  But in the end, it will not be able to compete with the XBox One or PlayStation 4.  My *guess* is that the Wii U will ultimately cease production within a year, and Nintendo will attempt to launch a stronger, more competitive system 3-5 years after that.  Hopefully for Nintendo and their fans' sake, it's a system that reestablishes their dominance in the gaming industry.",3,"A decent console, but it'll be back to the drawing board for Nintendo",1391299200,"02 2, 2014"

3910,103917,A1CO5Q5MCVQENY,B0015HZLVK,Panda,"[14, 20]","Lets start with the pros:1. Good graphics. Improve greatly but still kept the original form from its predecessor so fans of the original Tales will be delighted.2. New concept. Introduction of befriending monsters! (That's right! The very monster you kill you can now befriend and have them join you and level them up like Pokemon!)3. Very good voice acting. Usually when you get these japanime (is what I like to call them) based game and you have the dubbed American version, voice acting is terrible. However, this game really hit it on the spot with the voice acting. Awesome job (way better than the predecessor).4. Interesting plot line. It kept me interested though I have to say these japanime games really need to drop the cliche of memory problems/split personality issues. Really why does every hero has to have a problem with their memory?5. How you run into monsters actually affects the start of the battle! Yes it does! If you run into them from behind, you start the battle with them being dazed and vice versa.6. Those mini scenes now have sounds! You can actually hear them speak. And BTW I found many of them hilarious (kept me laughing and entertained).Now the bad:1. Not much has change besides the new concept of befriending monsters. Same old hack and slash, building up combos, ect. ect. One thing I dislike about this is the lack of skills they offer. Much less than what the original had.2. You can only use 2 main people. Yes the game previews are misleading! While old Tales of Symphonia heroes do reappear again and do join your party, you cannot control them. You can only essentially control the two main protagonist of this series. (You can't control the monster that you befriend either).3. AI is really stupid. Unlike the prequel the sequel setup for AI strategy is really bad in the sense that there is barely anything at all. Most of your option are ""Attack Freely"", ""Block Magic"", ""Frontiness"" and other of the sort. You tactics are really limited to the option that they give you. (So don't expect AI to do all of the work. Oh and I also love how when you're hp is low all the AI starts to heal you instead of just one...).4. Corniness. O-M-G some parts are really corny. ""I realize now your kindness is not really a weakness."" ""I will always love you forever."" ect. ect. If your into that mushy stuff then I guess it won't bother you that much but it bothers me a lot.5. Marta is extremely annoying sometimes (this is just my personal opinion though).6. Short. Even with doing sidequests and other things I finished the game in under 25 hours (pretty short for an RPG imo).7. I wish they had like help journal in the menu because honestly a lot of the concepts were confusing for me so a help option would be really nice idea in the menu.8. Where are the other Centurions? I mean the prequel actually shows you all the summon spirits but in this game you only get to see two out of 8 centurions...? Did they just get lazy and didn't want to design the other 6?Neutral stuff that could be good or bad depending on you:1. As I mentioned, though new concept are introduce most of the battle still hasn't change from the prequel. This means same stuff you've been doing in the last game. Whether this is good or bad depends on you really.2. While skills were limited in the sense of you can't use between S or T in this version it makes things more simple. (You don't have to be worried about all the skills you'll miss if you choose S instead of T, and likewise). Again, good or bad depends really on you.3. You no longer have the option of exploring the map. Initially key places appears on the map and you have to select them. You can't walk around the world map like you did in the prequel. This means game time and exploration cuts down dramatically. And also the tediousness of walking around only to find a dead end on a map...4. Stay loyal to its predecessor. Not much has change. However, you really need to play Tales of Symphonia before playing Dawn of the New World to truly appreciate all the game has to offer (there are more references back to the prequel). But maybe too loyal. I want a little bit of uniqueness too you know?5. Dungeons are short and easy to solve. Which makes the game easier to play. (Though I haven't tried this on hard mode yet so it may take longer... but that just means stronger monster).My overall view of this game:Basically, IMO this game was put together as a fan service for all those who were madly in love with Tales of Symphonia. People who haven't played the original will probably not enjoy this game as much as I can. The plot was stable but I found it... rushed in a sense. The game was cut really short as well. I found myself really disappointed though in the fact that I couldn't control my other heroes (that was a huge bomb shell for me). Though I was mostly impress with the voice acting (definitely hire these voice actors again). So my recommendation is, if you liked the prequel you'll probably like the sequel. If you didn't like it then I suggest not buying it since you'll probably won't like this as well. But hey not bad for a game that only cost 40 instead of the 50 right?",3,3 out of 5,1230768000,"01 1, 2009"

In another game the cheaters made it impossible to leave the game (the escape key no longer functioned) and they just blew you away (forever) while they were indestructible.

Overall the graphics are not the best, but I would say the background and the settings of the game is beautifully done.- International Version?  No you do not get the Japanese Vocals in this nor the Japanese Intro music you are stuck with the horrible dubbing.  But you do get all the update revisions and the bonus quest for Online play.- How long is the game?  Single player mode can be beaten within 40-50 hours of game play.  But what makes this game attractive is the Online portion of the game, since many veterans who owned this game are still clocking hours and hours in the game.  Online portion resembles Dark Cloud in some aspect, where you are given a Home Town which you can build upon; this Home Town can also serve as your Online Lobby among you and your friends.  Online play is pretty much based off of questing.- Storyline?  Yet a lot of people complain how simple the storyline was, I enjoyed it.  A lot of the RPGs these days have a massive storyline, but end up confusing the hell out of you.Final Notes: There are plenty of mix reviews on this game, but if you enjoy the traditional JRPG play style then this game is for you.  All in all, this game does have a lot of replay value if you intended to play the Online portion of the game.  Also keep in mind that the story does not have a closure, since a direct sequel is being made at the moment.",4,Honest Review,1266364800,"02 17, 2010"

Ozgar was eventually defeated by an Evany native (this is the plot of Crystal Key 1, BTW) and everything was supposed to be hunky-dory from then on.  But after a few years it became noticeable that the population were turning into mindless zombies.  You play Call, the son of the game's original hero.  Somehow you are unaffected by this soul-loss plague.  In the opening scenes, you are approached by a strange girl who says she's been looking for you.  Just as she is about to explain why, she is spirited away by two creeps in bizarre armour.  But she leaves behind a gateway...I know many people didn't like CK1.  I, however, did, despite its problems.  If you didn't, though, that's no reason you shouldn't play CK2.  It's a very different game.  Instead of being straight 1st person, it includes many 3rd person cutscenes, for instance.  There are also characters with whom you can interact.  The conversations are not participatory--that is, when you approach someone, the conversation just rolls on without your input (you don't have to choose topics, etc.)  You still have to pay attention, because there are several conversational clues to what you need to do.  The puzzles are generally inventory-based.  There were pros and cons about this.  One thing I liked about CK1 was that many of the puzzles were very intuitive--finding clues, the significance of which was not immediately obvious, to codes and locks and such.  That kind of puzzle was conspicuously absent here, and I found the game very easy.  On the other hand, the inventory was handled well.  It wasn't unwieldy, and items vanished once you had used them up.  There was relatively little pixel hunting, but you do have to look around each area carefully.  Most of the solutions made at least some kind of sense, although I did a fair amount of randomly trying inventory to see if anything worked.This is a beautiful, beautiful game with many locations to visit.  Some of the back and forthing got to be a bit of a pain, and I thought that in several locations there wasn't enough to do--one in particular seemed completely unnecessary.  The music and f/x are for the most part understated (tho' the jazz in the spaceport bar made me laugh every time).  There are unlimited saves, no timed puzzles, and you can't die.There are, however, a few bugs.  This game fully installs to your hard drive and you don't need the disc in the drive to play.  It doesn't tell you this anywhere in the manual or readme.  And if you leave the disc in the drive, it can interfer with gameplay--make your inventory disappear, etc.  There are also a couple other bugs I've heard of but did not experience--not being able to get back to a necessary location after forgetting to collect an inventory item was one.  I haven't heard of any patches, so the solution at this point seems to be frequent saving.CK2 was pretty short (15 hours, maybe) and pretty easy.  The ending, although not as abrupt as its predecessor's, was still pretty abrupt, leaving me wondering if I had missed something.  Still, I enjoyed it.

Let's just saying getting them to play it more than twice is not likely to happen again.The Concept of this game - Read stories from a storybook through a USB microphone and record your voice, or not. It seems like a good idea to help young children learn how to read and it is but For the age group it's for, Some words are too difficult.You have 16 stories. You can record your vocals as your read the story and later play it back or you can just read along without recording your vocals. Now, to some parents of toddlers and pre-schoolers, this might seem like a fun way to get your child to read and play video games at the same time but some words are too difficult for the age group this game seems to be for. They may know how to say some of the works So for your little ones, It's a challenge some of them just may not be ready for.The only fun any of us got were out of the mini games.So Unless your young ones are really good at reading, by the time their able to read this well, this type of game won't appeal to them as much. To Me, the age group this seems for are pre-kindergartners who are just learning to read, while the words used in this game seem too difficult to read unless you're a couple years older. My grand nephew's 5 year old cousin struggled on some words and just gave up.When you're recording your vocals, there isn't a computer helping you out, which is what takes the educational experience out of it for me. They just expect your young ones to know every single word. it records anything, which is the main problem.If you have Rock Band 2, Use that microphone and rent this. It's not worth 40 bucks. Maybe if it had a voice recognizer rather than just recording anything, it'd be a little more useful",2,Not that Great,1265500800,"02 7, 2010"

SMB had taken America by storm and changed the way NES was packaged and sold. People - *old* people of 30 years or more would get the thing out at parties and challenges would start, to the point that some wives would hide the cords when hosting guests.SMB2, however, was a damp squib. The game play was so radically different to SMB's run-jump-and-squish that people were not happy with it. Hell, I sat with one guy and we couldn't figure out what we were supposed to do from the start screen. After a few minutes we just played something else.I recently scored a copy of this for the Wii (with the other Mario Bros games) and started to explore it. The vertical drop start was stupidly annoying but I did eventually get it started this time around - after an inordinate amount of time wastage.In fact, it is no accident copies of SMB2 for the NES are rare. NES hurried SMB3 into production that featured a more natural SMB mechanic and added a sort of modest exploration mechanic too (and stuck in some ace puns like the flute from Legend of Zelda which has a *very* different effect in SMB3). SMB2 faded into well-deserved obscurity.It wasn't just that the game wasn't as much fun as SMB and SMB3, it fought you when it came to figuring out what you were supposed to *do* and that is just poor design.Yes, I get that the game has its fans who think it is the best thing since sliced bread. Good for them. I wouldn't have it any other way. There was a short-lived buzz of interest in the early Nintendo Fun Club magazine (which became Nintendo Power later in life) to prove they are not alone. But to claim this game has all the appeal of its predecessor or successor is stretching the point as far as the buying majority is concerned. Even Spy Hunter is more fun than this game in my opinion.I also know the eventually unveiled ""real history"" of this game, which was irrelevant to me by the time it was made public. I always knew it as SMB2. Excuses about it not being a ""real SMB game"" are lame and beside the point.This is the only SMB game I am never tempted to re-visit.",2,Bleh!,1394668800,"03 13, 2014"

Needless to say, I was quite skeptical of this game's potential. So fast forward a month later, I have some credit sitting around, and this game is available for a slightly cheaper price through Amazon Warehouse, so I pulled the trigger, and guess what? I actually enjoyed this game. Now, The First Templar is no big budget production, make no mistake about it. This is a smaller budget game from a developer that isn't well known at all. No one part will blow you away about The First Templar, and even as a whole it feels very outdated, but that doesn't make it bad. Now read on and find out why.Positives:- A Deep & Interesting Tale - The story in The First Templar revolves around the Order of the Knights Templar. Throughout the game there's an overarching story, as well as more story to find littered throughout the environments. It's all well done and will keep you involved in what's happening.- Single Player & Co-op - This is a game that is both enjoyable in single player and co-op form. The A.I. for the single player performs admirably and doesn't fail you under dire circumstances. However, there's also drop-in drop-out co-op play, which is well done and didn't present any issues while I was playing.- Simple Yet Fun Combat - The combat system in The First Templar allows for some really cool looking combos, finishers, etc. There's also block and roll mechanics for defending yourself from the enemy.- Nicely Rendered Environments - While no one object will really impress you visually in The First Templar, the environments generally look really nicely detailed and crisp. The resolution is rather sharp, so you won't get a sub-HD image here.- Goofy Banter - The characters throughout the story use some rather cheesy and enjoyable banter, which will keep you entertained throughout the experience.Negatives:- Graphics - The First Templar looks like a PC game from about 2004 or so. It's not a super ugly game or anything, but it certainly looks a bit rough at times. This isn't a cutting edge graphics pusher.- Animations - Aside from the combat and finishers, The First Templar's animations feel very rigid and poorly done.The First Templar won't redefine what a video game is. The First Templar won't make you fall in love. However, The First Templar will give you a fun and enjoyable action romp with some good banter and an interesting story.

To my surprise, its not even a tenth as good. This game is five on five with only street players (i had a feeling that was coming, with no NBA endorsement on the cover) and boring backdrops. There is just too much going on on the court in order to really have fun with street style moves. I also think the arial attack could be made more interesting. It plays like a generic basketball game with the addition of ankle breaking moves, which is a big step down from NBA Street, which was more like the Arcade NBA Jam style of ballin'.

People have retroactively re-named this type of game shmups an abreviated term meaning shoot-em ups not to be confused with light gun games which are referred to as on rails shooters if you cannot move independently and are moved a long a fixed path by the game.  All of that History lesson being said Castle of Shikigami III is a great shmup but will only appeal to A) people who like that type of game B) Hardcore Shmup and old school gamers. This game has really great graphics even for the Wii, the plot and characters are worth ignoring because they are so silly and make no sense. Aksys is one of my favorite Japanese game development teams along with my own personal favorite shmup maker Psikyo, and the much venerated Treasure they all make top-notch games that are fun to play. The things I really like about Aksys games are 1) The hand drawn artwork 2) The slick and stylish anime graphics 3) The really Unique characters 4) and their games are just really fun to play. Aksys did a wonderful job with the Blazblue games, and Contra Hard Corps. Uprising (which I plan on purchasing sometime soon on Xbox Live Arcade), and to a lesser extent the Guilty Gears Series which while good I have never really been into. I Think the person that gave  this game one star failed to recognize that while this game is may seem boring it is really fun. Castle of Shikigami III harkens back to they old days in the arcades when games did not need cutscenes that cost millions of dollars or a deep involved plot they just had to be fun and have decent graphics and this game accomplishes both things. I realize this review is overly long already but I have to say that I highly recommend this game to people who are hardcore shmup fans, people who play games on Mame, and people who want the nostalgia of playing games back in the day at the arcades.",4,Great Shoot-em up Game!!!!,1320364800,"11 4, 2011"

The graphics looked decent enough for DS, being in 3D polygons.The games are pretty much all mini-games. You have the options to select a story mode or just play the mini games. During story mode you are reading an interactive story, which I presume is based on the movie. On one side of the DS screen you have the words to the story, on the other you have a still photo, which are possibly still scenes from the movie. How it is interactive is you can use the stylus to click on certain parts of the image, say for example a smurf, and he will jump around, which sounds a little better then what it really is. On other parts you can click on things and it will ask if you want to play a mini-game, and if you get a decent score, you can unlock more parts of the mini-games. The story takes about 10 mins to complete, and has no real replay value to it.The mini-games consist of about 6 games. The first being you need to spot the smurf. On the left screen it shows you what smurf to find, and on the right it shows a bunch of smurfs where the one you need to find is in there somewhere. It's not as challenging as Wheres Waldo/Wally (The Books), but it might amuse a kid under 12 for a while.The next is just a coloring-in picture. You don't even really color, you just tap the area you want to fill and it changes color depending on what color you choose from the palette. Would only be good for those this appeals to.Another is a stupid cake decorating 'game'? There is no point to these really, just if you want to make a cake by choosing a base and decorating it. Might be fun for those up to the age of 7 or so?Another game is a jumping one where smurfs jump from something into the air to catch coins or something and then land on the other side. It's about the best game on here and the only thing that really resembled much of a game here.There is a couple of other things, and after every game is one of those find the smurf under cup mix up thing.The game is OK, but yet, another one of those games where it's all mini-games and aimed at kids mostly. I dunno, I haven't heard anything really good about the movie by kids or adults, so I don't see anyone kicking doors down to play this game, and they definitely wont kick themselves for never playing this. If you found it for under 5 bucks, you might be OK with it, anything more then that, you will feel ripped off.",2,Non Kids Review,1315008000,"09 3, 2011"

One star is the lowest a review is allowed to go, but my particular unit, while physically existing in my hands, does not work. I will certainly update my rating to reflect my experience with the system once I am actually able to.The system turns on, but does not output a video signal or boot up. The bar of light on top of the system continues to flash blue, but never turns white as it is apparently supposed to once it has started up. Attempts to boot it into &#34;safe mode&#34; to potentially diagnose or fix problems (such as re-installing the firmware available on Sony's website) do not work as the system immediately turns off after the second beep instead of entering safe mode. That's about it. It beeps, flashes blue, and sits there until you shut it off.I spent two and a half hours on the phone (over two of those hours on hold) attempting to see if they could diagnose or fix the issue, but they concluded the same, that the console was DOA and needed to be &#34;repaired&#34;. The relatively untrained customer service representative also made mention of the many calls he had fielded today (no doubt many of them being quite irate) and that almost every customer he had spoken with had experienced a very similar result to my own, and needed their consoles to be &#34;repaired&#34; as well. I was told by the representative that I should expect to receive a box to send my console to Sony &#34;within 7 to 10 business days&#34;. I do not know yet how accurate that is, especially since others have been told that the total turnaround to Sony and back should be within that same time frame, but that is what I was told to expect.After the apparently untrained customer service representative made another mention along the lines of &#34;Yeah, I don't think we really checked these before sending these out&#34; (a statement he was obviously not qualified or authorized to make), I was then pitched an extended warranty for my dead console, just in case there are any accidents with it (an offer I of course declined in its current state). I was extremely polite and cordial during the entire conversation, but at no point was even an apology made for my time and inconvenience or any hint of compassion or sympathy from their customer service representative.Several hours later, after I had still yet to receive the confirmation email regarding my &#34;service request&#34;, I made another attempt to contact Sony's PlayStation Support. With others online still reporting multi-hour waits on the phone, I decided to try their live chat option (since they apparently do not have an email address or form for their support sections). All subsequent attempts to contact Sony through their &#34;Live Assistance&#34; chat were also very unsuccessful, as every time I was lucky enough to enter the queue, I was eventually dropped out with a &#34;Status: Canceled There are no agents available to chat with you right now. Please try again later.&#34; message.I get it. Products fail. Devices don't operate as expected. With a mass market electronic item such as this, there will always be a certain percentage of systems that do not work as intended. However, early indications are that this is certainly higher than normal (even impacting promotional and press systems), and they do not appear to have handled the damage control well within this crucial time period.At this point, I'm currently weighing sending the unit back to Sony versus arranging for it to be returned to Amazon. I do not doubt that this product is well worth the money when it is operating in full capacity, but my console is among many others that simply failed to work right out of the box. Until I am able to adequately review this console in a fully-functional state, there is no way for me to give this product anything more than a single star as a rating. As a fan of games and who hold no allegiance to any particular company or brand, I do find it quite unfortunate that the situation for many, in addition to Sony's handling of the matter thus far, have erased just about all of the consumer goodwill they earned during E3.I currently have, on my coffee table in front of me as I type this, a dead console with a stack of half a dozen launch games, a PlayStation Plus subscription card, a PS4 camera, and two Dualshock 4's. Without any substantive response from Sony through the launch weekend, I feel that I will have no other choice than to return all of them, and maybe pick up the console again in a year or two once these issues have been resolved. For the sake of both Sony and their customers, let's hope that's something that will come sooner rather than later.",1,"Probably good, DOA/Pulsing Blue Light",1387584000,"12 21, 2013"

C'mon, this industry is COMPETITIVE, and it's 2013. That I could actually live with when balanced w/ gameplay, but this game seems really unfinished. You get stuck in the doorways w/ your teammates CONSTANTLY, and I can't tell you how many times the enemy literally spawned right in front of me. It's also the same enemy spawn pattern EVERY SINGLE TIME. No variety/randomness to it. The enemy bots are as stupid as can be. At least you figure the aliens' attacks/spawns would be more difficult to predict. No such luck. This game simply doesn't look good or play well after the 1st couple of times. The multiplayer was good in concept, but I felt the marines were ridiculously overpowered. That might've worked, if the alien controls weren't so friggin' clumsy/hard to control. They're just quirky. Once you rank up the aliens' attack moves it gets better, but never really fluent in motion. If you're a die hard fan you MIGHT enjoy the campaign the 1st couple of play throughs, but it gets old way too quickly for $60. I'm hoping a patch and some much improved DLC will make it slightly better, otherwise it's a bargain basement used copy buy/weekend rental. Ultimately, there's really no excuse in today's gaming environment(especially w/ shooters) for putting out a mediocre product like this.

Thonn ""vvv""","[17, 56]","First things first, I cannot fathom the amount of positive review this game has received here on amazon.These reviews are why i bought the game, thinking such an overwhelmingly positive viewpoint on a game could mean one couldnt go wrong in giving it a tryWRONG! Boy, was I wrongFirst things first, the dialogue is incredibly boring. The women you sleep with is a snooty twa t, that apparently has fighting and magic skills (yea right, women, intelligent, fighting? back in those days, if a women got smart, she'd get her head chopped off and thrown down a well, and they sure didnt have the arm or mentality for fighting). So you think well thats a bummer, the dialogue is boring and daft, the women are snooty and condescending and unrealistic, perhaps I can just skip it and try to enjoy the fight scenes.DOUBLE WRONG.The fighting mechanics are broken at best. You can only target and hit one person at a time, even if your being moshed on by four guys at once. Even if your blade happens to be slicing through four people in one swing, it only hits the one you are targeting. If you try to defend yourself, you can only defend against the attacks from the guy you are targeting. All the rest of the attacks from surrounding soldiers will hit you even if you are in defend mode, EVEN if they are right in front of you. A guy will make a slice at you from a 20 degree angle directly into your sword, and it will go right through it and damage you anyway. What? How does that make physical sense?Because of this horridly designed melee mechanic, it forces you to be on the constant defensive, and the only way you can stay alive is by strategizing. You can set a trap below your feet and one guy will run into it, and then basically run around in circles away from the clump of enemies and poke a few jabs at one guy until he eventually dies before they can all come in and hand you your own bottom. Then, you keep running around like a chicken with its head cut off throwing cheap shots and then running away until you eventually lower their ranks enough to the point where there is only one or two left, and then you can stun one while you kill the other, and then kill the last one off. If you get more than two enemies on you at once, it is practically impossible to stand your ground and not get damaged, even if you are constantly defending with your sword, since the defense parry is broken. HOW CAN YOU PLAY A MELEE GAME THAT IS DEPENDENT ON DEFENDING YOURSELF WITH A BROKEN PARRY? Its like the game stresses a defensive strategic gamestyle so much, but then the very thing that can keep you from getting killed in close hand combat doesn't work......honestly?Its a real shame, because the actual sword battling physics are fun. But instead of capitalizing on that, they force you to basically use as least melee as possible and only poke one guy a few games before you have to book it to the hills and set another trap. Then you let the clump of guys catch up and poke a few more jabs, and run away again. This might be a more realistic scenario to an actual 5 on 1 sword fight, but is it fun? NO. Not even close. It's a huge task, and not rewarding.On top of that, to add insult to injury, the autosave feature is worthless, and sets you back several skirmashes, so that you have to fight your way through several corridors just to get back to the place you keep dying on.So the logical thing would be to turn the difficulty down, right? WRONG. I was playing on normal. This is supposed to be for a normal player, not an rpg strategist champion. So i bit the bullet (unwillingly) and restarted it on easy. TOO easy. Really? There is a gigantic gap of difficulty from easy to normal.On a regular game, it would be like going from very easy to insane difficulty. Seriously? There is no in between. If i found out i liked the game, i might go challenge myself on a harder difficulty, but i dont want to get slaughtered and pull my hair out on what is deemed a normal difficulty. I sure dont want to play the same scene a million times over again, especially because the scene isnt even fun.And even once you do finally clear out all the guys in one section, its almost impossible to find the loot. They dont highlight it and they arrive in little bags that blend in with the scenery and you cant find them unless you walk over them. WTF.The magic is bland and almost entirely useless, this game is a button masher at heart, but they force the dependency on magic to keep you alive, which it is almost useless at doing, magic only can keep one guy subdued at a time, at lower levels, so if your getting swamped by 6 guys, you reduce it to five for a short amount of time. Like THAT helps. the only real way to stay alive like i mentioned above is by jabbing a few times and then running away, so it makes the combat horribly unsatisfying.Capitalizing on what another guy said, it very much does feel like someone picked you up and dropped you off in a setting. It does not feel like an open world experience, it feels like a level based structure where you achieve the main goal and warp on somewhere else. LAME. Especially because the gameplay isnt even fun.Honestly, I TRIED to like this game. I even gave it several tries since I paid 70 bucks on it (thanks amazon) and the concept and reviews all made it sound really cool. But its a real shame to be let up like that and dropped down like that. The only reason I even gave this game a second chance is because i paid so much for it, i rarely buy games new unless i think its gonna be a must have and thats what i hoped this would be and was horribly let down.Save your money and hours of frustration.If you find this game fun, your perception of fun is seriously warped.There are better RPG's, heck, better arcade games than this.",2,"Had the perfect Recipe, and tossed it with poor mechanics",1336176000,"05 5, 2012"

I love turn-based epics and J-rpgs like the FF series and Shin Megami Tensei, to darker, classic rpg's like Baldur's Gate and D&D.;After much deliberation, and reading such good reviews about this game, even one reviewer calling it ""The next Elder Scrolls"" (A series which I love) I decided to go out and buy it. This.... Is nowhere near as great as Elder Scrolls, or any other RPG I can think of to date.The Pros:Nice Graphics. Really good storyline and spot-on voice acting.The Cons:First things first, the character creation screen. Every race just looks like a slightly modified human, even dwarves have the appearence of strange, long-armed human midgets. Eye-brow/Head hair color not matching. I created a character with grey hair, the only available eyebrow color that remotely resembled the hair was this bright, white color, which looks ridiculous during cutscenes.Horribly linear. You are forced to travel on the very obvious dirt path, with no ability to deviate into water or anything outside of ""the ground"". Terrible design imo. If a game is made to look lush and inviting, you should be able to walk freely, and truly immerse yourself in the environment, not have to deal with ""invisible barriers"" that prevent you from even walking under bridges or stepping over 3 inches of rubble.The menu-system is tedious and annoying, very non-user friendly.You are given a limited number of bag slots to carry loot, but are given many opportunities to acquire items that appear to have no worth, thus leading to a full pack very early on, but not knowing what to sell or what to keep because of sloppy item descriptions.Enemies hit too hard and ""spot"" you before you can even see them. The AI is terrible, and usually results in your party ending up dead. The ""tactics"" option, which is a similar to FFXII's Gambit System, and yet is nowhere near as intuitive or useful, is again, badly designed.The amount of dialogue in this game...I cannot describe. There are cutscenes for everything, each with tedious dialogue that has to be ""answered"" to move forward with the conversation. At first, this feels like fun, but eventually, you just want them to get to the point instead of stopping so you can then press ""What happens next?"". Sometimes it attempts to pit you against a party member at the expense of their ""feelings"" for you, if you support the opposing member. No, I just want my party to bloody get along, end of story.There are some wierd physics in the game, like during cutscenes (one of millions), the heads turn to look at one another in this very robotic manner, even staring creepily at you while someone else is talking. Nice idea, bad execution.This game is by no means the ""Next Big RPG"". Not even close.

It was popular in the Nintendo world with Ikari Warriors and other hack and slash games as well.  Socom is probably the best multiplayer cooperative, but requires online play, and really isn't fun when two players are in the same room.  Games such as Desert Conflict 2 could have been perfect if they got the level design and save points correctly, but the genre never reached that pivotal point until now.Granted it's not perfect, but it sure is fun and mesmerizing while it lasts.  First off, the atmosphere is amazing.  It really feels like you're in the jungle with all these enemies in camouflage attacking you.  There is a bit of strategy involved as you have to discuss who goes where and who gets health.  The game only ends when both players die, so sometimes you have stay back to let the other one take the hits.  Really fun.  Most levels require trekking through a jungle, fighting enemies, and completing objectives.  The graphics and scenery are not only fitting, but play well with the level design perfectly.Yes, there is also a single person  mode, but from what I hear, it's nothing compared to Medal of Honor: Frontline.Here's the bad though: The gun controls (I use a standard PS2 controller), are jerky, and the player's movements are a bit too slow.  The first level consists of you walking up a ship and then firing lots of gun fire from stationary guns.  While the atmosphere is beyond impressive, it gets old after a while.  There are about 5-6 missions total, and unfortunately, a friend and I finished it just 5 hours on the normal setting.There is also online play, which is somewhat cool in that exists.  The online play, however, only consists or Quake like deathmatch and team deathmatches.  No cooperative level game play like Socom.  Unfortunately, the people who do play are not that fun to talk to, and are quite the First Person Shooter Nerds who will kill you as soon as you turn a corner.

Sure, you'll take a few shots while you run up to each bad guy, but since you can just interrogate a couple of guys to get that health back, you're rarely in need of health on the game's normal difficulty setting. The harder setting limits your ability to do this - but it is still too easy!The Punisher can go into ""slaughter mode,"" which slows the game down a bit(can anyone say BULLETTIME rip off?). While in it, you'll regain some of your health and drop your guns in favor of a never-ending supply of knives that you can throw into the faces of enemies with stunning accuracy. Again, too easy!!!You can grab any enemy for use as a human shield. Though doing this slows down your movement so much that it's NOT very useful.BOTTOMLINE: A sad attempt to put a new spin on an old concept. You have been here and you have done this!!!

This game eats and spits back out pretty much any machine.My system Quick Specs:OS - XP pro x64 editionRAM - 4 GB ddr2MoBoard - EVGA 680iProcessor - 3.0 Ghz Core 2 duoVid Card - 8800 gtxSo far I can play the game perfectly fine at 1920 x 1200 with everything turned on High, although the Anti-Aliasing is Off, with absolutely no Graphical errors (Well you can see the monitor flicker every once in a while because the monitor physically cannot refresh more than 60hz).  Just make sure your video card is up to date, cause if it is not, your going to get a lot of the errors some of these reviews mention.  However, once you turn it on the game gets exponentially slower.  It is playable to about x4, although if you set it to x16, the game becomes unplayable.  However, I can not see much of a difference if you have the anti aliasing off or on if you have the resolution turned up really high.  I know there will be obsessive people out there who will find that unacceptable though.Also an IMPORTANT NOTE: I my computer has both XP 32bit and XP pro x64 bit installed,(Some of my animation tools don't work for 64) and I have found that running it with the 64 bit OS the game had about a double increase in performance when running it on the same game settings.Gameplay:Well, it has the same openness to it as Far-Cry.  Although I found the AI a bit more stupid.  For example if you are standing right in front of one of the baddies, they will hesitate for a good long time to shoot you Etc.. Small things like that.  Also the game's single player campaign is extremely short (On the hardest mode With doing all the secondary objectives, this first time through the game only took me about 6 or 7 hours tops).  So in order to make the single player more interesting, you may wish to make a few passes without using either cloak, armor, or speed.

I bought it because it was Bethesda (can't be too bad, right?) and the previews looked like a pretty cool action game. Really though, it's more like puzzle game. It's broken up into segments or stages, and you have to return to the hub to get to the next stage. There is usually a boatride involved to move the story along, but the story never really gets interesting enough to make you care. Also, the character models are just plain ugly, I'm not sure why they chose this style. Even if you come across, say, a maid - you can't mess with her, she just walks around cleaning the same things over and over on a predetermined path. This is NOT a free roam type of game. If this would be a world setup like Assassin's Creed, I may have liked it more. They make it appear as if it is an open world, but it really isn't.For example, your task might be, ""cross this bridge"". There might be a couple of guards, an alarm system, a turret, and a dog in your way. Now, you can kill them all in a couple of different ways, or you can slow time and run by, you can sneak by, or even reprogram the turret and kill the alarm by removing the whale oil (no kidding). But since you're not really caring about the story or the characters, the fastest way is often to ""blink"" by. Sort of a teleport function. You can use the roof, or maybe a walkway under the bridge, but in the end, you just find a path across the bridge in whatever way suits you.Now there are a few loot items and gadgets etc, but you don't really need them much and they are not all that engaging anyway. You can maybe even swim by, but the fish will hurt you (no kidding, killer fish, although more annoying than threatening really). Of course you may want to posess a fish or a rat, or even another human (which means you can't fight, just move)... So in the end, the game gives you some options to play with, it's a puzzle game that you can solve in a variety of ways. Now for some people, that may be fun, but I felt kinda bored and just wanted to finiah it the fastest way possible so I can move on to the next game - and that is not value for your money.Also, why is this M-rated?I'd say, rent it, don't buy it before you try it.",3,Not what I expected... or wanted.,1352419200,"11 9, 2012"

287,132384,AV6NJTAB9YEI0,B002DT159Q,R. Tomek,"[284, 287]","We purchased this game hoping for the ability to have a yoga disc that provided us with a new yoga session each day.  What we got was not worthy of a single workout, let alone a daily routine.I popped in the disc and it had me create a profile, ok, that's easy enough.  I was presented with 3 game modes, story, training, or routine.  I figured I would start with story mode and see how the game plays.  We select our instructor, then we get a video from Anja Rubik saying why she loves yoga, then the game loads again.  Finally we get into the yoga temple.  For the first 5 minutes you follow your instructor around the building stopping to look at every statue and painting along the way, we finally get to a room that has a painting with a pose inside of it.  I finally get to the room and it teaches me that pose.  Basically, the story mode is going from room to room learning each pose one at a time with a couple minutes of break in between.  Argh.I went back to the main menu after a while and selected routine, it turns out we can select between 9 different routines with different target areas, heart, headache, etc.  I choose one of them and the voice says 'follow my movements' and bends over.  I bend over, at this point I can't see the screen, and sit there for a minute.  I decide to start looking up every 5 seconds and eventually he moves and starts doing another pose, at about the third pose the voice says 'remember to hold your pose' or something along those lines.  It just spits out a random sound byte every once in a while.  I guess if you did this a bunch of times and had it memorized it would be good, but if you have to keep turning your head to see what you are supposed to be doing at any time you kind of lose all concentration on what you are supposed to be doing.  There's no audio signals whatsoever during the routine.To get the full experience I went to the training mode.  This is basically just like story mode where you do one pose at a time but you actually get to choose your pose.  That's at least better than the story mode.In the end, I guess if you are a complete beginner to yoga, you could use this as an instructional video to see how to do poses, or you could just look up pictures on the internet and do that and end up with the same result.  There's really no reward to doing poses in story mode as nothing really unlocks except more rooms to do one pose in.The only thing Anja Rubik has to do with this game is the introduction video you see at the very beginning of the game.  After that it's silence except for horrible voiceovers that describe a painting in detail but then narrate a routine with the words 'follow me'.  This was a huge letdown for me in a game that had so much potential but in the end can't even be used for a workout.  Try to stay away from this game and stick with wii fit or a yoga dvd.Edit:  It turns out if you keep playing story mode long enough, that while you're following your instructor (who walks soooooooo slow) around the temple, Anja will randomly pop up to describe something else about yoga when you're not expecting it, only to have the game load for another minute afterward.  I don't want anyone saying ""you didn't play the game"" or whatever because of a small error in my post, so I figured I would add that correction.",1,So much potential..... wasted,1260230400,"12 8, 2009"

In the vein of NBA Street, it takes the game of football and removes it from the big stadiums and places it in parks and beaches where playground style football belongs. Like other Street titles, NFL Street spices up the idea by allowing you to play with real NFL stars in this setting.EA is famous for sports titles, their biggest being of course Madden Football. Unlike EA's other sports titles which focus heavily on realism and simulation of the professional game, NFL Street takes a more arcade like approach.The rules are simplified. In order to get a first down, simply get past the fixed marker on the field within four downs. There is absolutely no kicking. That means no punting and field goals. Extra points are determined by running the ball in (1 point) or passing it in (2 points). Even the playbook is rudimentary with very few options. This may sound like a bad thing, but it actually works. The idea is to make plays in the field not work with complicated playbooks.The action is intense. The hits are bigger. Even with no pads or helmets you never have to worry about an injury. This is a video game with artificial characters who can do anything. How could they possibly be hurt? That's the point of this game; it's a video game. It isn't Madden.Madden fans should find lots to like about this game. Firstly, EA made the controls very similar so the learning curve is shorter for Madden players. Second, those looking for a real football simulation already have Madden (or ESPN NFL Football or NFL Fever). Those players shouldn't be looking for another Madden clone. This game is about fun; big plays and big hits. The ability to pull off style maneuvers and taunt your opponents only adds to that.Now the bad. This game is hard. At least for me it is. I'm not that great at Madden but at least I can play competently. With this game, even on the easiest setting I'm having a rough time. ""Easy"" should be easy. Hardcore sports gamers probably won't mind (those that play Madden on All-Madden difficutly) but those of us (like me) that aren't hardcore gamers who'd like to pick this game up for the fun of it will be frustrated by the difficulty level. It's hard to have fun making trick plays when you can't do them.The other miss on this game is the play modes. NFL Street's primary play mode is Challenge Mode where you take a team of seven user-created characters (very cool BTW) and play games that have a certain challenge that must be met such as getting to 14 pts first without a turnover or performing certain style moves. Completing challenges earns you points to upgrade your players stats. Once you've upgrade your stats enough you can try the ladder portion of the mode where you play teams in a tournament format. The challenge mode is interesting, but in any other game it would be an additional mode, not the primary.Another mode are Pick-Up Game where 40 players are randomly generated and each person takes turns picking players to fill a seven man team for the true playground experience. This would be a lot cooler if you could play a tournament like this. Finally, there is the option to pick any team in the NFL and play them against other teams.What would have been nice is some sort of season type play, maybe not like the NFL exactly, but something. Winning seasons is more fun than winning games. Along with this would of course be stat tracking for your players. Right now there is none.Overall, NFL Street is a decent game worth buying if you are into the genre. The graphics suffer from that all-too-typical problem of having to be able to run on a PS2 which keeps many XBox games from looking as good as they should. Also, because this is EA, online multiplayer is only available for PS2 (no Live!). You can also play with up to 4-players on one system. I haven't tried this, but a couple of buddies who are competative would make this game a blast.The game is far from perfect, but far from poor as well. It mostly suffers from not enough polish and not going far enough with some of the ideas it proposes. NFL Street 2 will most likely address all this.

Unlike the previous editions, Ghost Recon 2 and GR2: Summit Strike, this game (for the Xbox) is played entirely in first person, with the gun in view.  I always like Ghost Recon as a first person shooter, like the original game and Island Thunder, so this was a plus for me.  A lot of people, however, probably would have loved another GR game with the over the shoulder view, like seen in the Xbox 360 version.  Personally, I have not been the biggest fan of the OTS view in GR games, but in terms of GRAW, I find it to work a lot better than the first person gun view seen in the Xbox version.  I'm not sure why they chose to have this view, considering the OTS view was in Ghost Recon 2 and Summit Strike, but this was the first of many other mistakes made in the making of this game.Another very noticeable detail that is far behind compared to the Xbox 360 version is the graphics.  I mean, obviously they are going to be worse, we are comparing an Xbox 360 game to one on the Xbox.  Even so, they seem pretty bad for the Xbox itself.  The game seems like it tries to be as good as the Xbox 360 version, but fails miserably.  Instead of trying to use the Xbox to the fullest, this game almost feels like a bad port, even though the gameplay is way different.  I mean, there is like a nice haze and lighting effects in the Xbox 360 version of the game, and in this version, they try to create this so hard, but it comes off very strange.  There is like this weird orange glow in the Xbox version.  Other than that, the textures are off, not horrendous, but nothing special.  The environments seem repetitive and graphically speaking are only as good if not worse than GR2.  The AI in the game seems very ""blah."" At some points in the game, they are very good and almost mimic ""real like"" situations.  Most of the time, however, they seem to run into the bullets.  One thing that is bad, but kind of good at the same time is that you only have 1 other soldier to help you along the way, instead of the 3 you get in the Xbox 360 version.  I like this in the sense that it's easier to control only one, but at the same time it makes for a weaker ""ghost recon"" experience.There is also a multiplayer portion of the game to keep players busy months into the future.  There is a wide variety of maps and weapons to choose from while playing over Xbox Live and makes for an enjoyable experience.  You can have 12 people in a game together at once which is a good number for this type of game.  There is also a co-op mode for yourself and one other player to play the campaign mission together online.Overall, this game is good and bad at the same time, with a higher portion leaning on the bad side.  There are things I liked, things I didn't like, and it was just an ""ok"" gaming experience.  Obviously the Xbox 360 version of the game is better, and because of this it makes this game even worse.  Because of this, if you are only looking for a single player experience, I would not recommend this game.  If you have Xbox Live and have liked Ghost Recon online in the past, you may want to look into picking this up.  If you have the choice between this and the Xbox 360 version, however...you know which one to buy! ?",2,Could have been great...but turned out wrong,1148256000,"05 22, 2006"

I did eventually break down and bought the game cheap after it had been out for a while. Expecting the absolute worst, I was definitely surprised at how much I actually liked it. It was different from all the previous games and did require the use of a controller which I had to buy to play it properly. But I did find I was happy with the game. It's because of that I did not wait for the reviews of OOTP but went ahead and preordered it. I just started playing it today, and I'm already thinking about puting it up for sale.The controls on OOTP are absolutely TERRIBLE! Even with a controller. It's incredibly difficult to aim, cast a spell (especially Wingardium Leviosa) and even just to walk is a royal pain! You can't even look up or down, at least I haven't found a way to.I tried using the keyboard after I found the controller so problematic, but that was even worse. So I went back to the controller.Aside from the controlls, the game play is at times choppy even on a really fast comp. The characters are not impressive, the attempt to digitize the original actors, doesn't always work, like Hermione looks pretty bad. And watching the missmatched mouth movements on ALL the characters can make you cringe! >_&lt;But I suppose I could overlook all of that if the game were engaging. Granted I've only just started the game, and just got to the part where they have their first DADA Class, but so far I really haven't done anything. Swept a few patches of leaves and repaired a couple of things.....played a game of chess, and a card matching game aka ""Exploding Snap"" but that's all. Maybe the game play picks up as you move along, but at this point in the other games, loads of stuff would have happened by now. Moaning Myrtle keeps appearing talking about all the cool things in a hidden room, but so far I haven't gotten the sense of any place to really explore. There are some doors still locked, but the game play is such I don't even have the anticipation to know what's behind them as I would in any of the other HP games.I'll play some more on it, since I went and spent the money, but I definitely don't see myself finishing this game as of right now.Maybe this game is more fun on a console, but looks like the HP series is dead on the PC. :(",2,Where Is That Harry Potter Magic?,1184025600,"07 10, 2007"
5303,171204,AWVCQU7QKVPXD,B004FYEZMQ,Antonio Gonzalez,"[6, 8]","I'm rating ME3 with one star ,not for the fact that it's a terrible game ,no in fact it's a great game if anything it's inferior to it's predecessor. But the main reason I'm rating it 1 star ,it's because the conclusion of the story is a raw insult to the thousands of fans who eagerly awaited this moment for a long time. After having invested a lot of money on the games and DLCs ,as well as hundreds of hours of game play ,just trying to twitch every part of the games to get the most out the story ,after all that I'm extremely disappointed and angry at EA and Bioware ,apparently they decided to give us loyal fans one of the worst possible endings you could give to an amazing story like this.I will keep the 1 star rating until they give me complete closure to the full story and an ending worthy of the series. Having read Bioware's blogs and other info websites, I came to the conclusion that this current ending was probably all part of a marketing experiment from Bioware just to get people talking, according to them they did not want the game to be forgettable (and so far they have succeeded!) I read many articles about this ,but one of them specifically caught my attention, when an angry disappointed fan asked them ; ""Is that it ,that's all the story for commander Shepard?"" they answered ; ""Hardest. Day. Ever. Seriously, if you people knew all the stuff we are planning...you'd, we'll - hold onto your copy of me3 forever."" ""We caaan't say more"" This all meaning that they were planning all of it from day one ,and they are planning to give the complete ending through DLC, like many of you I'm extremely disgusted with the ending of the game and I think it's not worthy of the series, but I for one will give them a chance to redeem themselves ,I want to see what they hold for us in the upcoming DLCs in April ,if they fail to deliver once again then this rating will simple stay as it is.Why would I give them a chance at all? Well many people don't know what it takes to make a game like this ,it takes endless hours of work and requires a lot of sacrifices and if they actually do what I'm hoping they will do ,well I'd say that is worth giving them a chance. There's a theory circulating around the web , that the almost identical current endings are not the real ones and that supposedly all the events from the last minutes are happening in Shepard's mind ,allegedly he is fighting indoctrination from the Reapers (represented by his last actions in the endings) and that the supposed ""FULL"" ending it's coming in the DLCs. Now ,I really have no idea if this if this assumptions are accurate ,though they seem quite reasonable given the current facts and having seen what EA's greediness is capable of (by charging extra for DLC),the pieces seem to fit together and as much as I'd like to say that I will not be paying for extra for DLC ,I think I'd be lying because all I ever want is closure to the story.I know that some people would call me a whiner and spoiled because I demand a better ending and closure to the series ,but after 5 long years of waiting and hundreds of hours of gameplay ,I just find it hard to accept when Bioware wants to give us a pile of steaming crap as reward. I don't really know what people who are satisfied with the current ending must be thinking, perhaps they're not as passionate as I am towards the series , but I personally hate the ending in this game and I think that such extraordinary story deserves a better one. I really doubt that someone who has played the 3 games (and has paid full price for them) will be content with the current ending, if they are ,then they belong to the 1% . I've also seen a few internet reviewers that think we are making a big deal out of this ,well of course they don't actually have to pay from their pocket to play the games ,we do ,they do not have that same sense of loss that the rest of us have and seriously I don't care if someone gets bothered by me complaining or by my rating ,put as much negative feedback as you want in my review , I will not change the rating ,I will keep it for as long as it takes until Bioware and EA give me what I paid for, I know that giving one star rating to a game in protest may not seem like much ,but the internet and people united seem to be doing wonders now in days.So you can either buy it right now if you are optimistic or wait til they release the DLC with the complete ending or until the price drops.",1,MASS EFFECT DESERVES BETTER THAN THIS.,1330992000,"03 6, 2012"

There's no excuse on the planet for anyone who owns a PS2 to purchase this title.Yeah,  LoW2 is improved from last year's...but that's not saying much at all. It's still complete trash.I made the mistake of taking my optimism from the awesome Smackdown 4 and somehow hoping beyond hope this game would be good, too. I really thought and hoped maybe they'd make this a decent game.It isn't.Yes, the gameplay is a little better. But again, that' really not saying much. You're still randomly crushing buttons hoping something works. The graphics are cartoonish but decent enough. The whole thing still feels...choppy and uncertain. The logic behind the gameplay just isn't that well done. Supposedly a lot of it is based on timing, but after being spoiled by SD 4 smooth and fluid controls where you can actually get something done, this hails from the Stone Age.The sound? Well, at least on the Xbox can you do a custom soundtrack. You'll want that, believe me! Can't do that on any other console, unfortunately. It's mostly annoying rock music that you would never spend a cent on otherwise.The wrestling intros look and sound a lot better than the first one.

329,70246,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000FRU0NU,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 0]","On one hand, it's quite easy to criticize a series like ""Halo"". It's a simple first-person shooter, control vehicles, grenades and big set-pieces are pretty standard in a lot of FPS' lately and it doesn't really do anything revolutionary to make it the ""shooter to end all shooters"". However, the mythos, characters and the sheer fun of the series as a whole is quite enticing and out of the shooter franchises involving aliens which include ""Resistance"" and ""Gears of War"", Halo probably has my favorite mythology tied to it. When the second game ended, it came with a slightly confusing storyline and a cliffhanger that didn't feel finished, like watching a tv show when the power goes out. Bungie took many of the criticisms found with both games and addressed them for this installment. Does it make it a better game?Story: When Halo 2 ended, Cortana had been captured by the Gravemind, the Prophet of Truth was heading to Earth to activate the Ark which would fire all Halo installations in the galaxy, effecting wiping every living being off the face of the universe. So in comes Master Chief and with the help of the Arbiter and the marines, the whole future of the galaxy rests on everyone's favorite Spartan.Graphics: Barring the repetitive level design from the first game, it was still a great looking game for its time, same with 2. The third game while given a major upgrade, might not have the flashy effects that are found in games like Gears, Bioshock or Call of Duty IV. However, the detailing, environments and the big battles are still here in all their chaoticness and seeing a Scarab destroyed a mere 40 feet from you is really awesome. Character animations are slightly iffy and because you can't install directly to the hard drive, you'll occasionally see some stutters and pauses though they're forgivable.Sound/Music: With that main theme, how can you not get pumped? Sweeping and very theatrical, the score is easily a highlight of the game and when the music kicks before a big battle, it's easy to get that sense of excitement and be jazzed up for the fight. Voice acting as always is excellent and despite the fact your teammates are inconsistent in their help, their lines are quite funny at times. Only thing I wish would've been addressed is the option to change the sound volume. I play with headphones (the earphone doesn't work) and when you're on co-op or multiplayer, would've been nice to turn the game sound low so you can hear Live chatter.Gameplay: Nothing much that's been changed from the 2nd game. Dual-wielding, vehicle boarding and the like is still the same though with it comes new additions. Added is the Mongoose, a sort of ATV with optional gunner in the back, and the favorite Chopper which is slightly harder to drive than a Ghost or Warthog for me but with spinning blades in front and cannons, it's easy to mow down enemies. Air units in the campaign are really only relagated to one part though there's a couple of parts where you can ride a Scorpion but Banshees on the ground are strangely absent unless you shoot one from the sky.One thing that I love the addition of is co-op for the campaign since as most can tell you, Legendary achievement can be a ***** and having up to 3 additional friends to help you out not only cancels out the weak friendly AI but speeds up the process since it isn't as wall-making every 10 minutes. Also you can find skulls within the game which will add special effects to the game. Some are just goofy like headshots on grunts will cause confetti to be thrown into the air complete with a ""hurray!"" soundbit while others will give enemies more grenade tossing capabilities or even have weapons have less ammo when picked up with the benefit being they add multipliers for a level score. Getting the achievements will require you to add more than one and it adds a nice arcade-y feel.What's made Halo 3 so popular since it came out is its multiplier and got to give it to Bungie for their commitment to the thing. 3 map packs plus a free redesigned one, title updates and countless players online, it makes for a bit of an addictive play. My only gripe is that like most MP games, you have to vote on a map and should the majority wins you get another map/game type automatically. However it's not like say Call of Duty IV where you're specifically in Capture the Flag or King of the Hill and the changes are the maps, you can be in one gametype, map gets vetoed and thrown into an entirely different map and game type. Plus let's face it: you've never seen as much snotty brats, arrogant punks and racist slurs as you can with the community in Halo 3. In fact, I think I heard the racist slur ***got near 20+ times in one match so be prepared to mute.With a near endless supply of players, looooong list of achievements and a fun campaign, Halo 3 has enough value for 60 bucks.

Recently, a batch of great SRPG games came out, Jeanne D'Arc, FF Tactics, Disgaea on the PSP, all 3 had it's specialty.Fire Emblem - Don't see what all the hype and rave reviews are about.  After just 1 week, I've already put this down to play Disgaea, it's far more fun.Characters - too many, so many that you do not feel attached to them, and many of them are unbalanced.  Which means some are crucial to the gameplay, some it's better to just leave them or let them die.Customization - There is none, each character has specific powers.  You select a weapon, but there is nothing else you can customize, no armor, nothing.  Yes, there is the relationship build up and skill, but it's stil lacking.Story itself - This is not bad, it's worth taking the time to read thru the text.  Though by this generation systems, you expect a little more graphical power or design flair, it's a tad bit boring presentation.How to generate funds / bonus items -  It's done thru fixed talks with NPCs.  There's no point to read thru those text, just click + and skip to the end and receive the funds or item.  IMHO, this is done poorly.Gameplay - Some characters are absolutely critital if you want to advance thru the harder levels.  It's easy to get killed, and I think most of us would like to keep all charactere alive.  To do so, you will need to reload the game A LOT.  Here's the problem, there is NO LOAD GAME option, you have to quit to Wii menu and start over.  This alone makes the whole process painful.Overall - If this game came out at the beginning of the year where there was absolutly no SRPG games, then it would be a solid 5 star.

For anyone who has not already purchased this game and regretted their decision, take a hint from the current price. At the time of this review, the price has already dropped by 17%, or $10. I honestly can't remember the last time I saw a games price drop that quickly. Wait a second... I'm pretty sure that it also happened with Madden 13, which also happens to be produced by EA. A lot of the flaws in this particular game have already been pointed out, but I will highlight the main issue that proved exceptionally annoying to me.Bugs: In both single player and multiplayer, I have frequented a number of issues. In single player, I have run into quite a few occasions where I had to reload the previous checkpoint in order to move on. You'll get to a certain point where the game doesn't realize it's supposed to move on, or you'll hear continuous fire from your defeated foes. Last I checked, dead people don't fire automatic weapons in your direction. In multiplayer, I'm not exactly sure if this is a bug, but I have no choice but to assume it is. Why on earth would you re-spawn me right in front of an enemy, giving me NO chance to react? Better yet, why would the game place me directly beneath a falling bomb, and expect me to survive for more than a half second?Aside from that, the game was unimaginative. All of these FPS games are starting to blend into one. You're a soldier, and you must save the world. My suggestion? Save your money, and stick with COD or Battlefield, as your preference goes. This is NOT worth your $50; it certainly wasn't worth the $60 they initially got from idiots like me.

I sat and endured the cutscenes, the long, repetetive gameplay and such, and I just don't see what was so great about this game.Now, I'm an artist first and a gamer second, so I didn't go into this game looking for something to do with my hands.  I went in looking for a compelling piece of art.  What I got, instead, was a cryptic, frustrating tale about self-sacrifice, corruption and foolishness.First off, the idea of fighting multiple enemies of absolutely enormous size and complexity is a good one, but it's been integrated much better into much better games before it, like Jak 3 and Kingdom Hearts.  Secondly, sure, the graphics look spiffy when you first see them, but it doesn't work, in the end, because they drag the framerate down pitifully.  Sometimes the game slowed up so much, that I could barely even tell where I was anymore.  It got so horrible that I didn't see more than three frames of animation in some seconds, which is a dreadful shame, given how beautiful some of the monsters would otherwise have been.Aside from that, this game is like one fifth of a good game.  By this I mean that it has intense, enormous boss battles, and that's it.  Better games would also include other characters with whom to interact, minor monsters to slay on your way to the big guys, a back story of some kind for the characters you play as and on behalf of, and a decent control system that wasn't clumsy, stiff or frustrating.  These are all failings that this game has.  Every single one obvious and damaging.  From a basic design elements point of view, this game is terrible.I just came off playing the Jak and Daxter series, and this game's character plays so stiffly and moves so stupidly by comparison that I could barely stand it.  The controls are frustrating, difficult to master, and in many cases unresponsive as well, and the character's ""tired-meter"" was conceptually a good idea, but executed poorly.From the beginning of the game, you play as some nameless dude who went to a forbidden land to restore the soul of some dead maiden who we're told virtually nothing about.  Not knowing anything at all about either of these characters, I, as a gamer, had little motivation to play.  Additionally, the vast, expansive surroundings might be pretty in a movie, but they were too easy to get lost in, since the so-called ""map"" this game provides you with is no kind of help at all, and getting lost was no fun either, because there weren't any secrets to find, and no music is played at all in this game, except during the boss fights, and even then there are only about six different music tracks in the whole game.  Basically, in this game, you start at a temple in the center of the land, follow the light of the sword to a boss.  Defeat the boss, and wind up back at the temple.  Repeat sixteen times.  That's pretty much all there is to this game.  Disappointing, eh?I think I should also mention that even if you do have the stamina and self-abusive tendency needed to reach the game's ending, the ending of this game is really more like a punishment than a reward for winning.

These games have 16 bit graphics, no polygons, and low-end sprites, so how can Square possibly explain the ridiculous amount of load time at each interval of the game?

8179,98437,AK246V9TNUHT4,B000ZKA0KA,dansw4,"[4, 6]","Well I was one of those fans of the series who has been playing since the release of Socom 1.Like most people I felt the series fell off after Socom 2.Most people who enjoyed Socom 3 and CA were new comers who didn't know the difference and so they accepted the later games while the original fans left the series and the community crumbled.Socom Confrontation was supposed to be the return to greatness the original fans hoped for.We had all been dreaming of a next gen Socom to wipe out all the issues we had had on the PS 2 such as cheating and lag.The developers promised to return to the roots and restore the core gameplay of the earlier games in the series.They failed on so many levels.To make matters worse while saving some not so important core elements they changed the most important core elements that were directly related to giving this game the Socom feel or atmosphere.You're going to see alot of fanboys who love everything with Socom slapped on the cover drooling all over this game and encouraging you to purchase it which is very ill advised as most people aren't as easily impressed by just the Socom name alone.First issue is well documented,the server errors,logging on is a problem,consoles locking up is a problem,freezing while in the middle of a game is a problem,the problems at launch are far worse then the average launch title.Fanboys say ""oh but wait for the patches that can be fixed"".Ok so i will tell you know about the gameplay elements themselves that can't be fixed as I am 100% sure Slant 6 won't make patches for anything other then game errors.First off this game was built around OTS (over the shoulder view) and while it has a classic view the contols for classic view are seriously compromised because of the existance of OTS as the default.Plus classic view is not quite the same third person view we used to have,its zoomed in closer to your back (shows about waist up and doesn't show the whole body even in wide open parts of the map unless you look down at your feet.You now need to use motion controls to lean instead of the easy d-pad lean that was much more responsive.Motion controls are a gimmick to label it ""next gen"" and are never as precise as the simple push of a button.The reason d-pad controls are gone for classic view is that in night vision you are forced into OTS view and need d-pad controls to use for the OTS perspective,so yes they didn't exactly tell the truth when they said we would have a true classic view cause its a different third person perspective and OTS is still forced on you anytime you go into night vision.Gone also is first person perspective that you could use to see through windows and bushes.After having that view for urban warfare in past games you will see how sorely missed it is when you have the hampered view trying to shoot people from windows.Also you can't move the camera up that way to see out a bush so you pretty much have to crawl out of the bush and expose alot of your body to see,so much for hiding like a seal.The control set up is far less intuitive then it was before.The simple quick swap is gone and you must now stop playing and select your new weapon through a weapon wheel menu that hampers the fluidity of gameplay.throwing grenades can be done with a button but to get the furthest range you need to use motion controls and even then your max range is half what it used to be.On top of that the kill radius on grenades is non existant.Its literally like throwing firecrackers at the opponents.For every 4 grenades that land and explode right in the enemies lap you are lucky to get one kill.Most times grenades that blow up right at your feel take away no health at all.Gone is the old knockdown radius that would knock an opponent down and injure him if he was just out of the killzone but in shrapnel range.You either die or you don't no inbetween.The grenade system feels like it is more primitive then even the first Socom on the PS 2 which was made about 8 years ago.Nothing next gen about the grenades here it took steps backwards to the 16 bit era of video games.The lobby system is watered down from past games.The friends list is very generic no longer showing the room your friend is in or allowing you to join off the friends list.There are people already glitching so gone is the theory that PS 3 would bring a cheat free experience.Only time will tell if it can be fixed if they make good on promises to start banning people which will probably be on hold while they concentrate on the bugs first.No person in their right mind can say this is the best Socom yet.If success of this game rides on graphics alone then i can see some people praising this game as the graphics are a definite upgrade from the old Socoms.As far as all the other elements such as controls,gameplay,and the community/lobby features this game is a massive downgrade in every way.New people to the series and graphics fanatics seem to be the only ones claiming this is the best Socom ever.True Socom fans would never embarass themselves by making such a claim.I will say that when you can get into a game its better then Socom 3 and CA but Socom 1 and 2 overall are still by far the best games in this series.After seeing the finished product I wish they had just kept Zipper making the game and fired Seth Luisi as he is the real problem thats hurting the series.A remake of the old Socom 2 with better hit detection and graphics woudl have been a huge improvement over this game.Many will tell you ""oh well it needed to evolve and change"".I can understand that if the changes were taking the game forward but when a next gen system takes the game backwards in gameplay,controls,and lobby system I hardly see where that is evolving.I think people still praising this game are in severe denial and want to love this game cause its better then to accept that Socom has died.After the newness of the graphics and maps wears off i think they will realize the only real improvements were graphics and sound while everything else is a downgrade compared to Socoms 1 and 2.These are only some of the issues i could go on and on and right a whole book of stupid additions and omissions from this new Socom.Its so lacking that I am literally jaw dropping shocked at how some people claiming to be with the series since day 1 call this the best Socom yet.They had to have forgotten everything that made the old Socoms great or are simply to blinded by new pretty graphics to stop and notice everything thats been screwed up severely.Save your money and get RFOM 2 when it comes out.The first Resistance Fall of Man had a better server on their very first attempt and Sony has gone cheap lackluster servers for 5 straight Socoms now.I played the first RFOM to tide me over till Socom but after playing it RFOM is easily the better online game.Until we get a next gen Socom that truly goes back to its roots RFOM is the new king of online play for the PS 3 and the improvements I have already seen in the sequel coming next month just cement its spot all the more.If you are willing to sacrafice some realism for a fun game with a much smoother server to play with people all over the world the RFOM series is best all around.It took me awhile to adjust to RFOM as I loved Socom and the real military aspects but the gameplay has just fallen so far off its not the same Socom the original players knew and loved.",2,Don't believe fanboy hype,1225238400,"10

I remember spending hours running around the heliport and gunning down enemies. Later on, I rented this game once, but only got so far before frustration overtook me (I got to the level with Vulcan Raven in a tank). Now, ten years later, I manage to get my hands on a used copy here at Amazon (I spent about $12.00+4.00 S&H;). All I can say is that it's more than worth every penny I spent.Story: Truly exquisite. You play as Solid Snake (who is perhaps one of the most famous PlayStation game characters if not one of the most famous game characters of all time), who is sent to Shadow Moses Island in Alaska to neutralize a terrorist threat (pretty standard action movie stuff). But, the story will continue to throw various plot twists that may seem random at first, but add up in the end (I'm avoiding the main plot elements just so I don't spoil it for anyone who hasn't played the game yet). 10/10.Graphics: For its time, this game had amazing graphics. The only PS1 games I can think of that had better graphics than this game would be the Syphon Filter series. 9/10.Sound: Crisp sound effects (for it's time), wonderfully composed musical score, and outstanding voice acting (David Hayter was especially good). 9.3/10.Gameplay: I have played through many games since my first experience with MGS 10 years ago (I've played through roughly 200 games throughout my lifetime. Yeah, I know, I'm a loser with no life), and this game still captivates me. If a game made a decade ago still manages to provide engaging gameplay after all these many years, that is a fantastic accomplishment. 10/10.But, most importantly, this game delivers a few good messages. Examples would include the threat nuclear warfare possesses on the world as well as the meaning of life. Sadly, most gamers do not take these messages in and just sees MGS as simply a game. MGS is more than a game, it is perhaps the first game to ever attempt a movie-like feel and succeed. I hope this game, as well as its creators (Konami, Hideo Kojima, and Yoji Shinkawa) will go down in history as important figures in the gaming industry.All I can say is that this game deserves at least 9.0/10 overall. With that said, I cannot understand why Jeff Gerstmann decided to give it a score lower than that. I consider this one of the best games I've ever played, and is even better than some of the newer games I've played (Gears of War and CoD4 have nothing on this game). This game is even better than MGS2 (even though MGS2 is a fantastic game in its own right, I give MGS2 a 9.6/10), and I'm currently looking forward to playing MGS3 (I'm planning to get a PS2 soon. The only systems I currently own are a PlayStation 1 and a high-end PC).

It was a BIG hit for all Loyal Nintendo fans and Mortal Kombat fanatics. Those little 64-polygraphic characters provided hours of entertainment, because it was something completely new. I mean, C'mon, what other game has characters from OTHER games combine into ONE game where they battle each other in places from OTHER games and use items from OTHER games? Tick-Tock, Tick-Tock, Tick-Tock, BZZZZZ! Times up, NOTHING!Well now, it's back! With EVERYTHING from the old games (Except for 1 element, I'll get into that later) plus MORE, MORE, MORE! This time with perfectly smoothed textures and tons more moves, plus more options. Super Smash is a super smash!As I've already said, much of the original version has been included in to the newer one. The old characters: Mario, DK, Link, Samus, Yoshi, Kirby, Fox and Pikachu, plus the 4 hidden chatacters, Luigi, Captain Falcon, Ness and Jigglypuff, are all in it. (In the newer one, Captain Falcon and Ness have already been unlocked for you. You must unlock Jigglypuff and Luigi.) Every level and item is in it. It would take forever to explain all the details, but basically it is the same as the 1st one. You unlock levels and characters like the 1st one, more moves, etc. It's amazing. However, what happened to Board the Platforms? Oh well, I can't put anything lower that 10/10.Don't get me started on the Graphics. Really, don't, or I'll be going on...and on...and on...and on. I was blown away the first time I played Super Smash Bros. Not because my TV overheated and exploded, however that could add into it, because of the Graphics. Full 360 degress character, items and levels. The texture is SOOOOOO smothed. I love it. I can't explain much more. You can Zoom in and out, and the texture and quality will remain the same 4eva! There's no doubt in me saying this gets a 10/10.Pika! Pika! Pika! Pika! Pika! Pika! Okay, I swear, If Mario goe's &quot;Ha Ha!&quot; or Captain Falcon goes &quot;Falcon!&quot; again I will scream! The sound in this game is the bare minimum. Everything has a sound, but unfortuantly it is always the same. Most smashing sfx are the same. All weapons make the same sound, and when players perform moves they say the same thing. The constant DING sound whenever a menu is changed will annoy most users. I really thing Nintendo could have had a field day with the sounds, but just slapped some crude sounds and called it quits. I have to knock 'em down with a low 7/10.Well, for one thing, the speed is definitly not as fast at Pikachu running, but it gets there. The only thing that kinda bugs me is that it saves at every menu. It takes about 4 seconds or so, along with some other things as well. All I can say is that it is fast but not superman. It's about as good as a 9/10.With any fighting game, controls are key. This game makes it very easy with simple commands such as &quot;a&quot; is punch/kick/slap, whatever. &quot;b&quot; is a standerd power move. Z is throw, R is shield. The most technical is goes into is having to move the analog stick up, down, left or right with pressing &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot;. The control makes the grade, with a perfect 10/10.The great thing about Super Smash is that it's not fun, fun, fun ... then it's over. The great multiplayer option lets you play endless hours with friends or againts the CPU. Unlike the original 1p mode, where you would fight Link, 12 kirbies, Fox, etc. and it would be the same everytime, this game bends the rules. It is simply Fight one random character, then fight 12 random charactders, then fight one random character, etc. Replay again and again, knowing that you can't go wrong with a 10/10.All in all, Super Smash makes it's trademark by being Nintendo all the way. Made by Nintendo, made only for Nintendo, this game will beat Xbox's trademarked games anyday.Let's review:Gameplay: 10/10Graphics: 10/10Sound: 7/10Speed: 9/10Controls: 10/10Replay value: 10/10CHEATS: Nothing really.

However, this game offers so much more than what a quick glance can give.  The characters' graphics may not be fully detailed, but their personalities and body language make up for all of that.  Each character was thoughtfully created with unique story, background,and demeanor.  Unlike many of the Final Fantasy games, one does not get to know the villan as well as the mighty Sephiroth on Final Fantasy VII.  I hated him, yet felt sorry for him at the same time. To make it an even more intriguing game along side of the story-line and character development, the battle system was well constructed.  The Materia system allowed the player to equip Materia, (magic) to their weapons.  (Certain weapons had more Materia slots than others)  When some Materia is linked together such as -All- and -Lighting- it can create an overall attack on all the enemies versus just one. Though some may debate that the graphics sucked, one has to understand that this game came out in 1997.  Graphics six years ago were bound to be worse than what they are now.Pros: Characters that were deeply thought out and well woven into the plotA fun and addicting battle systemSeveral mini-games and great incentives for winningChocobo breeding and racingCons: Graphics may bother those that are use to newer gamesOverall, this game has so much to offer.  I am always tempted to replay it because of things I missed, such as getting Cloud's final limit break Omnislash or beating Ruby and Emerald Weapon.  Just twenty minutes into the game, I was hooked.

If a game isn't fun, there's no use in playing it (save maybe those wonderful little achievements). It doesn't matter how many hours you put into it every night, accusing 12-year olds from Australia for being hackers. What sells me on the game is the campaign. The campaign for Modern Warfare 2 is cool, sure. It's diverse, true. But it's not quite as gripping as the one inCall of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, even though it does take two plot turns that (without spoiling anything) might shock or upset you. If you've seen most of today's action blockbusters, it's possible you'll just shrug it off and move on though. And that's a bit what happened with the campaign this time around; interesting, yes, but too scattered all over the place to be truly memorable. Khaled Al-Asad was a name that rung through your head over and over again in the previous game, a clear bad guy, a clear objective. What's going on in Modern Warfare 2? There's Makarov, clearly evil, but is he really the main bad guy? Who is who from the first game, where are their allegiances now? Who was I in the first one, who am I now? Soap? Someone else? I can't really make sense of it. Give me a clear cut bad guy and a clear cut good guy, don't jump around in time and around different characters, it's dizzying. It's daring, sure, it's cool and stylish, yes, but is the plot actually good and involving? Not as much when you're literally thrown all over the place.So what makes up for it? The Spec Ops co-op mode is absolutely amazing, wonderful little mini-missions with different sorts of challenges for one or two players online or off. You'll have to be tactical, action oriented, think on your feet and take your time if you hope to make it through them all. You might also have to resort to dirty tricks for the truly hard ones, but as long as that's only done in Spec Ops, no problem.And multiplayer? It's overrated. Yes, I said it. There's more content and customization, but does that actually make it better or more fun? To begin with, maybe. Throwing knives are cool and fun to play with, making your dream-class is nice, and there are many weapon (and other) specific mini-challenges to tide you over. But when thousands or millions of players (and the majority you're likely to run into being young males) devote their time to something as they do, it's likely to become watered down. There's no fairness to all the killstreak stuff, one team or player is likely to dominate because of their cowardly tactics or superior experience (statistically). There's prepubescant swearing, camping, cheating, hacking, singing, goofing, all kinds of players speaking different languages, and a general lack of players just out to have fun with their gaming. If you happen to come across a female player who's just having fun about the whole thing, or can actually carry on conversation, you're in luck. The bottom line is that people are the worst. Young people even more so. Competitive young males in large quantities, the absolute worst out of all of them. If you're with buddies you know and trust, have some fun. If you play with someone you know and trust, jump in a private chat and kill some time. Other than that, I see no real point in going online, because it's surely not enjoyable on any level (meaning fair, lighthearted or with pleasant interactions).

I read all the developer interviews where they stressed the ""battle repetitiveness"" that makes so many shooters boring games of whack-a-mole where you mow down endless waves of enemies with no pacing, atmosphere, or story.  I read how they really admired the story and pacing of Half-Life 2 and how they were influenced by that fantastic, unmatchable game. I even preordered it.  So, what did I end up with? The ""battle repetitiveness"" of a shooter where you mow down endless waves of enemies with no pacing, atmosphere, or story.  I ended up with the same game I have played over and over again in the past but with different game titles.  And while I realize that graphics alone don't make a great game, I at least want one that is pretty. The graphics in this game look like they were developed on an early version of a PS2.  They are that bad.It's a shame, the story idea was great - but 10 minutes into the game I realized the gameplay in the campaign is a poor carbon copy of every shooter that has come before it. Nothing fresh, nothing new, nothing innovative.  In a word, the gameplay is stale.  Unless you have never played a shooter before, you will get bored quickly with the campaign.  Mindless AI, glitchy companions, and a superweapon that you get to deploy that automatically kills all enemies in sight.  I didn't try multiplayer - I was too disheartened by the campaign, and figured not using my MP redemption code would help my resale value.  What's that you say?  Multiplayer redemption code?  That's right - you must redeem the in-box code to play on-line, this developer's sneaky way of jamming the used game market.  Nice - sell me a crappy game and then make whoever else buys it purchase a new code to play on line.  That fact that this tired pile of digital waste has managed to sell over a million copies tells you how desperate FPS fans are for a breath of fresh air and innovation.

2200,42332,A423XLYS1Q1D6,B0000AI1KC,"Christian Wheeler ""Husband/Father/Gamer/Proud...","[4, 4]","This game is just plain fun. Not a lot of logic, and the plot and story are so-so, but when it comes to action and humor, this is one of the best titles to grace the market in some time. You play Roman, the leader of a group of ragtag heroes known as the Lionhearts. You're accompanied by Jonesy, a moleman who speaks with a thick Scottish brogue and is (more or less) an expert with explosives; Q, formerly one of the King's robotic guards who became self-aware and now spends as much time making tea as fighting; and Rexus, a squat, smelly, and blind seer who's not so sharp after suffering head trauma. The plot is pretty straightforward: Find the Book of Rule and use it to break the evil King's rule over the land. The format is very simple: Go from Point A to Point B, find this or that, destroy this or that, and kill everything that gets in your way. It's a very simplistic shooter, and under other circumstances, this game would barely dent the market. But what makes &quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot; stand out is its sense of humor and non-stop action.The game's humor may be its strongest aspect. The characters are just plain funny, with Rexus and Jonesy stealing most of the best lines. The game takes shots at the French and references &quot;Aliens,&quot; &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; and especially &quot;Star Wars,&quot; (this is from LucasArts, after all). The cutscenes are especially funny, with jokes and gags about cannibalism, leprosy, and even a doomspeaking evangelist type who looks a lot like Elvis. There's also an exploding sheep (Seriously). Especially funny are a trio of gardening robots that are reprogrammed to be soldiers; unfortunately, the programming backfires: they only want to defend plants and flowers, go into battle screaming &quot;Death to the salad-eaters!&quot; and nearly execute a poor villager for being a &quot;cereal killer&quot; (he was caught reaping wheat!)Equally funny are the weapons you're provided with. Some are given at the beginning of a level; other are rewarded when you reach various pubs scattered throughout the game (these also serve as save points and will recharge your health). You get some pretty standard weapons: rifle, machine gun, sniper rifle, rocket launcher, etc. But it's the special weapons that are most fun: There's the Land Shark Gun, which fires a projectile that turns into--you guessed it--a shark that gobbles up your enemies from under the ground! There's the Guy Fawkes Traitor Bomb (a clever reference to a notorious English traitor) which makes your enemies turn against each other for a time. There's the Topsy Turvy Bomb, which briefly reverses gravity and causes your enemies to fly off the earth; and my personal favorite, The World's Smallest Black Hole. Toss it and stand back, because it sucks in everything around it.Most of the missions are straightforward and usually involve defending something or someone or knocking out enemy positions. The game switches from third-person (with a thankfully fixed camera position) to first-person when you take the helm of a mounted gun and defend a village or the like from advancing troops (who come in swarms). Too many get over the wall and the mission fails. Other missions involve flying (with a cool jetpack-type device) across levels and finding and destroying enemy positions.  Located throughout the game are tokens that will unlock special features and cheats (though most gamesites have them posted). The graphics are above-average, controls are uncomplicated and easy to use, and the voicework is top notch, with animation standouts Jeff Bennett, Kath Soucie, and Rob Paulson providing many of the voices.A couple of hints: When you hear a siren alerting the enemy to your presence, find it as quickly as possible and destroy it. Otherwise, enemies keep coming as long as it is sounding. The same is true for the rounded troop houses you encounter here and there. Much like the generators in &quot;Gauntlet,&quot; they'll keep spawning enemies until you destroy them. Two Sticky Bombs will usually do the trick. If you can't hit a sniper attacking you from a window, throw a Sticky Bomb onto the structure and just blow up the building and him with it. When attacking rocket towers, run underneath them. They can't hit you if you're right below them.  Also, when defending Lily's house in Zitwalla, stay near her house. There's no need to wander away to find enemy paratroopers and leave Lily's house undefended; they'll come to you. As long as her home and at least one other residence survives, you'll complete the level. (That was the only one that gave me any trouble). Oh, and once you beat the game (a reasonable challenge) stay tuned through the final cutscene for a funny sing-along.If you like a good shoot-em-up with a sense of humor (think Serious Sam, for example), then this is the game for you.",4,A shooter with a great sense of humor,1085270400,"05 23, 2004"

In short, this game is an extremely generic run around and blast tangos shooter. There are some fun moments here and there as you might expect. A few weeks after having last played it, I really don't remember a single mission individually. All were based up on going into some building, blasting a bunch of carbon-copy tangos, and either defusing a bomb or rescuing some hostages. I seem to recall one mission had a long slog through a garage, while another was in some sort of cave.The big departure is that you do not plan any of this. You are dropped into a spot and told to rescue hostages or do some other such B movie standard mission. You are led down a linear path to the objective, after which a new mission is given. It's all totally generic and forgettable. You do get to choose your weapons and kit loudout, but you can't do any of the extreme customization as could in Rogue Spear or Raven Shield. I am not sure why Ubisoft is going down this path. Part of the appeal of the older R6 games was the strategy and planning aspect. This game to me looks like a port from a console, and it shows badly. It's very simplistic and linear. Ubisoft is sticking it to the console fans who made this a great franchise in the late 90s and early 00s.Graphics are quite sharp in the game, and the voice acting and sounds are ok as well. But shortly after I finished the first few missions, I simply put the game down and reloaded CALL OF DUTY 4. There's really nothing here you cannot find in any other special forces themed shooter.

After disappointments like Wreckless and 4x4 Evo 2 I wasn't expecting much, but I was wrong.Rallisport centers around a career mode where you compete in different types of rally racing to gain points and unlock more cars and races.  Race types include ice racing, hill climbs, rallycross and traditional rallies.  The tracks are pretty well varied and can be very challenging, especially the hill climbs.My main complaint about the gameplay is the points system.  Points are accumulated based on factors such as finish position and car damage.  I would prefer to see overall rally position determined by cumulative time rather than points.  Games such as Collin McRae Rally 2 are superior in this area.Also, the cars aren't very tunable.  The standard suspension settings and tire choices are there, but that's all.  This game is clearly on the arcade side of the sim/arcade line.Controlling the cars smoothly with the XBox controller can be a bit difficult, especially when you drive the unlimited class cars.  The cars are rather touchy and the short travel of the XBox joystick makes subtle steering adjustments difficult.Finally, the graphics really are wonderful.  The attention to detail on the tracks is amazing.  Drive through the grass and you'll the individual blades.  Dust and damage will accumulate on your car over the course of a rally.  The presentation is really well done.

8036,48825,A22Y1BUB20E150,B0002CHIZ6,Adam B,"[1, 1]","Far Cry Instincts for the Xbox is a really fun shooter that has an insane single player game and an even better multiplayer experience. Throughout the single player game, you go through many different levels that all play extremely well. Unlike the PC game, this console version is very straight forward, usually with a go from A to B kind of feel. This isn't a bad thing in any way, especially since there are usually small areas with a couple ways to complete the task at hand. Overall, the gameplay is amazing and is truly a great FPS shooter. One thing I loved while playing this game was the stealth aspects you can use. You can crouch and stay prone which will allow enemies to not suspect you coming. You can also set up traps which once you get the hang of it can be a lot of fun. You can also throw rocks and stones to trick your enemies to think you're somewhere else, which allows for a quick unsuspecting kill. The last huge thing that makes the single player experience so exciting the feral abilities. When using these, your character (Jack Carver) uses his animal instincts and turns into a whole new person. He has this one ability where, if close enough to your enemy, you can lunge toward and send your enemy flying through the air. This is SO much fun and my favorite of all the different abilities. There are also abilities including night vision and super speed which are very fun too.The best thing, in my opinion, is the multiplayer aspect of this game. There are the basic deathmatch and team deathmatch, along with other modes including Steal the Sample (probably my favorite, plays much like Capture the Flag). There is a lot of diversity in the maps which makes for a great online experience. Another great thing about the multiplayer experience is the insanely good map editor. This is something that I've always thought would make a great addition to a game, and this game has it...YAY! There is also the fun Predator mode which is also addicting and fun. Overall, this game rocked and the multiplayer is equally as fun!",4,Map Editor Makes this game!!!,1147737600,"05 16, 2006"

Those flaws were that you had no idea how badly you were damaging your foes, the damage ratio to you was out of whack, it was incredibly linear, and all the bosses were pathetically easy (Solar Flare, Energy Attack/Kamehameha) and you only played as Goku (thus a huge chunk of story was removed).  I am glad to say that most of the problems this time around were fixed.The story behind legacy of Goku 2 is that Trunks arrives from the future to warn the heroes that a pair of Androids will arrive in three years and basically destroy the world.  He gives Goku some medicine so that he does not die prematurly and then takes off so they can prepare.  Three years later a set of androids appear but they are not the ones trunks had fought, those appear later along with a third.  Soon the androids are face a threat called cell along with the heroes and eventually cell creates a tournament.Like I said most of the problems with the first were corrected.  Now with the use of a scouter you can examine the strengths of everything in the game, from cell down to a little butterfly.  When you attack or are being hit a red nuber appears that basically sasy how much life was removed.  So damage ratio was greatly even out.  You play much of the game as Gohan, Piccolo, and Vegeta with Trunks and Goku playable at the end.  The linear factor was removed as with a world map you can go wherever you want.However some problems remain.  While the bosses are smarter this time around, ultimatly they do revert back to a basic pattern.  Get to close they punch, stand to far they shoot energy.  How you decide to fight is up to you.  Also the flight meter which provied a quick escape in Legacy 1 was removed.  So no longer if you are getting your ass kicked and need a quick escape can you.Overall Legacy of Goku 2 is a solid game that is a lot of fun.  it has it's share of problems but what game doesn't.

So when I entered the first starting area I was more than ready to be impressed.  There was a lot that impressed me too... stellar graphics (even on my laptop), and engaging combat system that is simple to understand but dynamic and requires a lot of skill to master, a social experience that makes you genuinely happy to see strangers, PVP (which I haven't tried), huge world PVP world battles (which I've only dabbled in), and much more.But the moment I realized that GW2 was more than a good game, was when I stopped and asked myself ""what the heck am I doing here?"" as I looked around the cave in which I had just killed the veteran boss to loot a chest.  This wasn't even the right part of the map. I had set out to follow my story, but saw a large battle going on so I joined that, and continued engaging in the cool stuff I came across, until I found myself several hours later here in the cave having completely forgot where I was going int he first place.And that's why I love GW2.  Because it is more like Skyrim than WoW. It is a game that tells stories best through the world and your experience in it.  Sure, not everything is perfect (ie. the main story quest cutscenes and voice acting is hit or miss, my server filled up very fast so if a friend gets the game we can't play WvW together, for some the game may not explain everything clearly enough), but like Skyrim the flaws that do exist are greatly outweighed by the strengths of the game and just how fun the world is.",5,A game to get lost in,1347753600,"09 16, 2012"

6077,215669,A287P9ABNCGIJY,B00B98HBTA,Mcdo,"[0, 0]","This is a fantastic game. Me and the wife have owned pretty much all lego games so far. I was getting tired of the concept by Lord of the Rings. I was not gonna get this one, but during the holiday season, how can you say no to your girlfriend, especially when the lego games are the only one she will play. I decided to give this one a shot. Boy, i am a happy camper right now.CONCEPT - I will start to talk about what impress me the most: the fact that it is MARVEL. So many characters to choose from and so much to do. They really nailed the MARVEL concept with this game. Every characters have their own powers; flying, super strenght, web slinging, ice, fire, telekinesis, electricity, etc...it`s all there. On top of that, they can pretty much all drive cars except the bigger characters like Hulk or the Abomination. I honestly have not had that much fun with a lego game since the first star wars lego game.GRAPHICS - The colors are really strong and everything looks alive in Lego New York city. There is a lot of interactions with other characters within the city. The Marvel lego characters just looks plain awesome in their lego attire. A lot of fun to to watch the transformations some of them have like small venom becoming big venom or Bruce Banner becoming the Hulk. You can transform at will too except when you first start the game and you have to find a Shield Terminal first before you can have the option of transforming any characters at will. Overall, the menus are gorgeous and very pleasant to look at. It really looks and feel like a Marvel game.GAMEPLAY - I got used to the gameplay pretty quick. Not much to it. I find sometimes, the character can do something i do not want especially when flying. They are a bit hard to control, but not the end of the world hard. Driving is a bit of the same. Not overly hard, but sometime you may miss your race objective because you ran in a lamp post or another car you just could not avoid. Still, the gameplay mechanics works very well. I find the tutorial of the game lacking a bit as sometime you will not really know what your next objective is. But, nothing internet can`t solve.FUN - There is a ton of collectibles to find in this game, from hidden characters, to hidden stan lee characters needing helps to red bricks to gold bricks to canisters....there is a lot. Even just collecting coins not doing any missions is fun. You get to try all different characters and their powers. This game is free roam where you can go and do what you please whenever you please while in the city. However, when you start a mission, then it is how the game wants you to do it. I find the New York map pretty big and i find i never run out of ideas for things to do.CONCLUSION - I think this game might just be the best lego game yet. It was really the MARVEL theme which got me to play this one...(and my wife..lol). We really enjoy this game and we recommend to buy this game if you are like us and enjoy couple games or game for adults/kids or any of the previous lego games. You won`t feel lost as this game is a bit of the same os previous lego games. But why change a winning formula?4/5 stars  - I took away one star because sometime, you will get stuck in a level and there will be a game breaking bug preventing you from continuing. You will be at the end of the level waiting for something to happen but nada. After a while, you will have to hard reset (power off) your ps3 and start that level over only to find out you did the exact same thing but this time, the game fowarded the way it should have been the first time. It occured twice so far in two different levels and we are only at 1/3 of the game.

This review is not based off memory cards or games currently on the system.Quality: The PS Vita is a very durable system. I do recommend applying a screen protector as soon as you can if you buy this, It is a touch screen after all. Just holding this in your hands it feels very well put together. In this however, is one of the reasons i knock a star off it. Every little crack from the different parts put together on this system is like a magnet for hair or strings getting stuck in it. Every time i turn around there is a little string or hair stuck in a crack and it wont come out. I yank on it and it breaks and your left with a tiny bit of that hair or material still stick in the crack. This bothers me a lot. The screen is amazing on this. It is an OLED touch screen, the touch is exactly the same as an iPod touch. so you know how that will function, and the screen is vibrant. wallpapers i make on my computer look even better on the vita than they do on my very expensive monitor. As for the buttons, they are really good. the dpad and the face buttons are clicky (Think Gameboy SP, dsphat, 3ds)and feel very good. The shoulder buttons feel like pressing on a ps2 remotes shoulder buttons. And lastly the analog sticks are pretty unique. They are not like the old psp, and not like 3ds. they stick out (bad for pocket) like a home console controller. they do not click in to function as a button, nor do they click into the system so you can pocket it. Highly recommend a case for transportation.Form/Design: The PS Vita has a great shape. It is approximately 2 inches longer, 1/2 wider, and same width as the competitor, 3ds(closed). And unlike the competitor, the sides are rounded, and rounds off towards the back. Making it extremely comfortable to hold. Most of its features are located in good places. On the bottom you have the memory card slot, charging/data port, and headphone jack. Although i am one to prefer the cord going out the top of the system rather than the bottom, its okay. At the top there's volume, game cartridge, power, and an un-named, unmentioned in the booklets, port. I assume this is for connecting to the ps3? Everything seems to be in the right places, Except the speakers. Although they sound amazing when compared to the competition, they are horribly placed. Your thumbs will cover them 100% of the time when playing and its hard to hear. They could have been at the bottom and/or top of the systems face.Performance: The Vita is amazing, the touch screen features perform just like an ipod touch does. The multi-tasking feature is really good to have, it allows you have multiple things open at one and switch between them easily. The speakers sounds great. The screen displays so vibrant, colorful, and beautifully you wont know what hit you. The camera images are amazing. Especially when compared to the competitions camera. They are a little smaller than the screens natural resolution though. The buttons are in great places and its easy to play games. The rear touch panel is as responsive as the screen. I think rear touch panel is a great addition to this system, it adds so many possibilities, its not hard to use, and you don't have take your thumbs off the buttons to use it like the touch screen.All in all a great system, With lots of potential. I see great things from the vita. And the only reason it is 4/5 star is because of its speaker placement, and cracks in the pieces that make up the Vita get hair stuck in them.",4,Really good handheld.,1330819200,"03 4, 2012"

To start out with I will say the graphical upgrade is noticeable but not  a massive step forward. The presentation , the game modes , and the menus are still the same the game just just has better textures and the models and runs very smooth. The major strides have been made are in the actual gameplay itself. That is night and day and it is for the better. Madden 25 on PS3 in my opinion was a step back from Madden 13 , they fixed some issues with the physics but in the process made the AI completely brain dead. The ability for defensive backs and offensive linemen to read and react was the worse I can remember ever playing. This game has fixed that, the players react properly to situations.

8047,46675,A3RCCIYFDJD0R4,B0001Y7404,Joyce,"[8, 15]","The set up sounded interesting enough.  Man trapped in apartment, which showed more signs of decay as the time passed.  Man finds hole in wall, and--in his desperation to get out--decided to go inside, and into a hellish adventure. Game, START.When actually playing the game, though, suddenly you wish that the main character, James Townsend, would just succumb to the monsters, ghosts, and other unnamable creatures trying to kill him.  Why?  Because nearly everything is wrong with the game.First, the good stuff: The graphics and the creepy atmosphere is on par and above when compared to its Playstation 2 predecessors.  Someone mentioned the graphics is brigher than before, which is a great welcome since I wasn't too much of a fan of the too dark to play atmosphere.  The music is on key, providing an appropriately somber welcome during the introduction and an ant-crawing-up-your-spine chills during gameplay.  This makes the bonus soundtrack included with pre-orders a gem to own.Now, the bad stuff.  I do not like the new inventory system one bit.  You can only carry a small amount of items, and when you accidentally pick up useless ones, you have to trek back to your house (I'll talk about why that gets tiring later) and put it in your magic infinite box.  But you can't risk NOT picking up the item, because you MIGHT need it and you need to pick up it up to read the description of it.  This limited inventory system is made even worse by the fact that each CLIP of 12 bullets for your first gun (this goes for later firearms, too) takes up one space in your iventory by itself!  Sure, in your magic infinite capacity box they take up only one space for all the bullets, but in your pocket, yes, one space per clip.  This makes guns a very unreliable source of protection... or you can run home everytime you run out of bullets...assuming you HAD any.  Ammo is terrible scarce, even on easy mode.  You can rely on your trusty melee weapon near the beginning, but later on, the enemies are too tough, one big healing resource is taken away from you and turned into a source of hp depletion, and you have concerns other than your own life (such as, getting a good ending) to risk just bashing the enemies brains in with a shovel.Adding to even more trips back to your pad is that fact that the only place to save is on a notebook in your apartment.  So yes, you have to go there everytime you want to save.  Horrible!  When I'm in the middle of the story, I don't want to make an extra special trip back to my apartment just so I don't lose an hours worth of play.Healing items are also scarce, so in the first half of the game, anytime you needed to heal up your HP, you run home and wait for your HP to fill back up.The trip back to and from the apartment through the hole in your wall gets tiresome around the fifth time to do it.  Leaving the apartment, you get the same animation for ""warp speed into the depths of despare through a stone pipe"" everytime, and no matter how many buttons I press, I can't skip that movie.  Same thing with returning to your apartment, you have to endure the annoying ""James is not a morning person"" ritual of getting out of bed that takes WAY too long for it to be fun when you're on a routine trip back to your place for a save or to drop off some items.The ghost enemies are the most annoying enemies I've ever encountered.  At first I was scared, since I couldn't kill them and their mere presence depletes your HP, but soon they just grew into a pain in the rear.  In a certain level, there were a lot of narrow passageways.  If a ghost were to approach (and they approach fast), you would have to take it down (you can stun them) before proceeding... that would have been fine, if its undead body doesn't block your walkway!  So you find yourself in a hopeless situation that causes you to find the nearest exit, leave, and come back into the room, hoping you can outrun the ghost this time before it blocks your path.Okay, so this could be made up with a great story.  Silent Hill 3 wasn't the most innovative in gameplay, but the GREAT backstory made up for the small number of flaws and made it a fantastic horror experience.  This time, the story could not overcome all the problems with gameplay.  Bits of the story is revealed as you play, but it just doesn't happen fast enough for is not riveting enough to keep me interested.  James seems like a nice enough guy, but since you mostly encounter the dead, or people who aren't key to the story for the first half of the game, you don't find out too much about James at all.I've been a big fan of the Silent Hill series since the first game came out, but this one is just utterly dissapointing.  I know they didn't rush it, but the problem might be they tried too many things that just didn't work.  I'm a fan of creative innovation, but just because it's new doesn't mean I'll praise it.

My friends and I just beat it, and it took us 13 hours. BUT, about 10 of those hours were a giant movie that had one of the trippiest stories ever. Metal Gear Solid 2 started out awesome with Snake infiltrating a tanker trying to gain information about Metal Gear (much like the other Metal Gear games), but then the story gets really weird.For those of you who enjoy regular American military games, stop playing after you beat all of the tanker mission because after you beat that, this game turns into some weird Japanimation Manga story with some messed up twists and dialogue that totally seems like the plot did not translate well from Japanese at all. Your are not even Snake for most of the game, you're some guy named Raiden, and no one tells you what the heck is going on. You just do what needs to be done, then the plot takes another messed up twist, and you do something else.The story even does some crazy stuff like tell you about morals and family values. At one time, while you are playing as Raiden and walking around naked trying to kill guys, your contact starts wigging out and saying crazy stuff. He even blatantly told us to turn off the game, we'd been playing for too long, and we might damage our eyes! &quot;What the Hell!?&quot;Oh, the game also made sure to tell us about the differences between killing in real life and in a video game. I have no idea why it did this since you spent most of the game watching a lot of computer generated movies rather than killing people!Don't get me wrong, when you actually do get to play the game, the game play and graphics rule. Too bad you only get to actually play for 3 or 4 hours, and less than half that time you play as Snake. I can't believe they even tried to pass this game off as Metal Gear. This should be a Metal Gear parallel story, sort of like VR missions.I gave this game 3 stars simply because the beginning where you are actually Solid Snake sneaking around the tanker trying to find the new Metal Gear is really awesome. That portion of the game deserves 5 stars. YET, the other 60-70% of the game/movie deserves only 1 to 0 stars for being so weird. I MEAN YOU DON'T EVEN PLAY AS SNAKE FOR HALF THE GAME!!!! That would be like playing a Legend of Zelda game as some new character that we've never heard of before. I am still in shock at how dumb the story sounded as the game progressed.If you are truly a Metal Gear fan, you might not enjoy this game and find it too trippy and weird for your taste, but if you like role-playing games with crazy twists that don't make sense in the end, buy this game now.I may have a limited view of this game after beating it on easy the first time, but the simple truth about this game whether you agree with anything I said above or not is that most of the game is completed through computer generated animation and movie sequences. You really don't get much game-play out of this game. SURE it's DVD video and cool and all, but IF I WANTED A DVD I WOULD HAVE RENTED A DVD!!!Also, at one point in the game, the President of the United States of America grabs the main character in the crotch and says, ""So, you are a man.""...Now, they may do that on some weird Japanese cartoons, but here in America, the President should be a no nonsense guy, and not some crotch-grabbing sissy who sells out the country.""What the Hell!?""",3,Why wasn't this game written by Americans!?,1008374400,"12 15, 2001"

The part that sold me on getting it was the ability to change memories and having that immediately affect the person you are with. Just doing this as a play feature could have been very interesting. But those are the special moments in each subsection. They are not the main playing mechanic. There's closed off levels of uninspired platforming that lead you to boring brawling sections that you get to create customized fighting combos between 2 buttons. And by customize I mean pick wether the punch or kick is healing, punishing, or cooldown reducing. You don't really pick the length of the combo or order of buttons. The story is very interesting.

As others have mentioned you need to install AC2 and ACB from the disc to your internal drive first before being able to play them, something that is not mentioned anywhere in the product description.  I personally have the 500GB super slim so this isn't a huge deal, but I still have to stick the disc back in to play either title and Revelations autostarts if you're not cycling through the menus or have it disabled.

coming out it was a must have.In this game you play as Jaws and the game takes place 30 years after the movie but the freeroam is the fun part of the game.Not only that you can eat,kill and dismember people several ways.You can rip off heads,arms,legs and cut the torsoe in half.There is even a lot of blood in the water when you do this.When cutting the person in half you see intestines floating in the water as well.If you do it carefully you can take a person and rip an arm or leg off and watch them swim yell and try to get away.The game software is smart to.You can injure or kill a person and throw them to sharks and crocodiles and they will attack it and eat it.Sometimes they will even attack you and try to get it away from you.There also a move that allows you to take the person and bob them in the water with blood coming out of their mouth then you jump and the whole body is dismembered.You also have the tailwhip which also does extreme damage.Not only do you have your choice of swimmers to attack but also kiakers,jetskiers,divers,boaters etc.You can also damage boats,docks and sometimes even buildings.Not only can you attack people but the many animals in this game like bull sharks,mako sharks,porbeagle sharks,tiger sharks,oceanic whitetip sharks,octopus,killer whales(Note these are in open ocean south in the southwest part of the map these killer whales are easy to kill compared to the one in storymode)dolphins,whale sharks,salt water crocodiles,walruses,elephant seals,seasnakes,leapord seals,seals and a lot of other animals and species of fish.You will only find the crocodiles at open ocean west in the occasious canals.They hang out at the bridges and they will attack you sometimes as many as 5 at a time but their too easy to kill,you can just cut them in half and eat them.I actually ripped a womans leg off without killing her and spit her out,she was screaming then about 4 crocs attacked her and she screamed even louder.The canals by the way are in the freshwater river.The Occasious Canals are in the Southeastern part of the map at open ocean West.There are also various Jellyfish in this game in different locations the deadliest ones are at Open Ocean West close to the save mark on the map.Their in big groups and can take your health down very quicklyOnce you beat the story part of the game that place becomes unlocked in freeroam with the exception of the last mission.There are also some freeroam places that arn't in the story like.1)Fishermans Isle You can eat off of a dead blue whale here and there is some challenges as well.Location Open Ocean South near the beaches on the East side of the map.It is marked on the map.2)Occasious Canals This is were the Salt Water Crocs hang out.Location Open Ocean West in the Southeast corner of the map.3)The Deep Sea Caves These are really deep and the deeper you go the darker it gets.4)The Island in the Southeast part of Open Ocean South I forget the name of the island but there are many dolphins and the walruses are here to.Also close to the current to strong line you can see the blue or sperm whale.5)Cable Junction at Open Ocean East this is one of the movie locations.The storymode has you destroying stuff or causing explosions but they also feature the two formitable bosses that can kill you.The Killer Whale in the 2nd mission when your trying to escape SeaWorld can take you in it's mouth twirl you around and jump up in the air with you.The killer whale is as strong as and big as you are and it's bigger then it's free roaming cousins.With this predator it's a good idea to level up your moves and eat dolphins and people when you have a chance to so you can upgrade your health.Once beating the orca a cutscene shows you jumping in the air with it and cutting it in half.2)The Giant Squid is in the Deep mission.He is much bigger then you and can even swallow and eat you.The object here is to dodge his attacks and rip off his tentacles then followup by taking out his eyes.Points of interestYou have to beat the killer whale in Seaworld to open up freeroam.When you first start the game you don't have much health you can upgrade it in the second level.You can open up a lot of movie clips in the bonus section by finding tin cans.Once all license plates are found you can open all levels.Mermaids,skeletons etc offer bonus points.There are a lot of sukin ships.Some animals are hard to see such as sea snakes and seahorses at Open Ocean East.Cutting on sharkvision will help you see them.Seasnakes by the way are close to the compass on the map at open ocean east as are the seahorses and whale sharks.ConsSwimmers are only at Open Ocean SouthNo SurfersNo Dog is in freeroam.The only place you see the dog is at the doggone challenge at open ocean east.No night The Dead of Night story mission is the only way you attack swimmers at night.The dead of night free roam mission is in daylight.Camera issuesFramerate Drops especially with bubbles.The game doesn't let you play as other sharks like the tiger,bull etc.This should have been a bonus feature.The tiger sharks are too small.I highly recommend Jaws Unleashed for a great freeroaming shark

Yes, Saints Row 4 reuses the maps, character models, art assets, vehicles, weapons, and progression system from 3. It was built from an unfinished expansion while Volition hung in a hoary nightmare limbo between the folding of THQ and their purchase by Deep Silver. As such, SR4 seems rather stale, as though it doesn't bring much freshness to the table in terms of gameplay.But under all that samey rust, there's some gleaming steel of awesome.The plot sees The Boss, now president of the United States, trapped in an alien virtual reality prison. Escaping, you must return to the prison to wreck havoc, which allows Kinsey (your hacker friend from the first game) to slowly undermine the alien regime. Periodically you must also venture aboard the alien ship in the &#34;real&#34; world, missions which have a less cartoony, more cautious feel. Within the simulation you develop an arsenal of superpowers, complete a variety of familiar minigames to achieve territory control, and generally just mess stuff up.Missions in the simulator are frankly rather lackluster. Most optional missions are just strings of minigames you would play anyway (I could turn half of them in upon getting them) and the campaign missions are all pretty easy. But studded into this are gems, such as the inside of an accomplice's head rendered as a 16-bit fighting game (which itself could carry a full length title) or a spaceship escape set to Haddaway's What is Love? The problem is that these slivers of awesome are mostly stacked toward the game's end, and you have to wade through a few hours of Saints-Row-3-Over-Again to see them. There are other oddities- vehicles become useless fairly quickly due to your powers, and the new guns (Dubstep gun!) so hugely outclass the regular pistols and shotguns you'll never use your whole arsenal. A number of environments that were interactive in SR3 are just left in and sit around being eerily empty as well.For me, the good and fresh outweighed the bad and stale (especially a fantastic 80s cartoon reference at the end that I won't spoil) but I can't in good conscience say that will be true for everyone. Part of what made Saints Row 3 so awesome was that it was all new and all that craziness came as a surprise; here most of it won't.

This game is one of the few games that always holds my interest and keeps me coming back to play until its completed.The save points and story progression makes this easy as opposed to other games that I will play about halfway through and put it down and let it collect dust for several months and come back and complete it or sell the game.Now for what I do like and what I don't like.THE BIGGEST ISSUE that annoys me in this game is the control function that whilst in heated combat trying to manuver Issac dodging, running, rolling, turning around facing multiple necromorphs while holding his weapon is that in toggles the weapon to either the one you are not wanting to use or the scouter droid. I have gotten killed many times and have wanted to smash the controller because I will turn to shoot at another target and I go from shoting my energy blaster to deploying the scouter droid mid battle!! I HATE THIS!!. I don't know if there is a way to change the configuration to only use the arrow buttons to change weapons instead of using the left joysticks while you are trying to fight. This is the main reason I wont give this game five stars.I do like is the new ammo stockpiling system. I like being able to get one type of ammo for all of the weapons that can be attained or crafted.I do like the concept of the scouter droid, and tne building of custom weapons.I don't like the slow opening kinesis operated doors. I have been situations where the doors take too long to open, especially while you are being chased by regenerating necromorphs.There have also been situations where I have had a hard time figuring out what it is I am supposed to be doing. My objective could be to repair parts of a damaged ship, finding items in the weightless space environment & its hard for me to locate the objective because of debris and lighting. I have a hi def LCD 3D tv so its not my television.And this is probably just my skill level, but it seems like the AI sends a lot of enemies after you at once which can be overwhelming. This is on the medium difficulty setting too. It seems like they designed the difficulty higher this installment.All in all I really am enjoying the game except for the unwanted weapon toggling issue in mid battle. And if they comoe out with a Deadspace 4, I will buy that one too. :-)",4,"single player non Co Op review- Its good as always, but frustrating at some points",1361836800,"02 26, 2013"

Lyon,"[3, 9]","While the game tries to be different, has the same basic issues other MMOs have.Of course most of the quest only require you to get less than ten items or kills. That makes it quick to get a quest done. Of course alot of the quest are in PQ areas, and if you happen to trigger the final number needed for the next stage, things will get a lot harder and the targets you need will not respawn. If the PQ reset, which happens when the stages are completed or fails, then every creature part of that PQ respawns at the exact same time. which sucks when you get to the scroll you need and jumped by 4 guys that you just cleared out.Sometimes the quest have you try and find a item, of course they give you a general indicator where it can be. That is a good feature, where you don't have to guess where something is on the map. then that is it, you have to do the old mouse cursor search method until something lights up. trying to find a rune, that is surrounded by enemies, flat on the ground and covered in grass is alot of fun when you don't know what it looks like.Combat is a little rough, it doesn't auto release a dead target for a live one that is attacking you. You can also run miles and still have the same dead target selected. Then there are the bugs where the NPC enemy will reset, auto heal and then come back at you with your half health. Of course it seems only certain targets will cause a link, where everyone around the target will attack you. If you pick the normal targets and then you don't have to worry about that.You are also smashing your special attacks, because most times it looks like the normal attacks just involve you standing there getting hit.If you see a friendly NPC getting hit, and you attack it's enemy that is almost dead. you can claim that enemy kill, xp, gold, and items, even if it is a champion type.RvR scenario is interesting, but not very balanced when it comes weapons and armor. Granted it bumps you up to the average level, say to 17 from your real level of 13. Of course the level 20s with there better armor and weapons, make it a bit tougher to get a kill. You can hit them and it seems you are not doing any damage. Which gets bad when you have alot of lower levels on your side.The normal RvR is not much better, where a single person can pick off the guards to get the point. Sort of pointless it seems, where it doesn't seem you are making any head way.There is very little in the way of instruction, sometimes you have to figure how to do something by trial and error. Flying is the only way to get around, within a region you have to find the flight masters. Flights between the regions all you have to do is click on the name of the region. I found that by accident, there was nothing about that in the Faqs or anywhere eles I looked within the game.Alot of the ideas are almost a photo copy of WoW. The same item colors, grey, white, green, and blue. alot of the control defaults are there also. So if you played WoW, you won't have much of a issue with the controls and such.Yes this is a more negative review, very little positive.This game should have been left in the oven a little longer. It can be better if they fix alot of the bugs, and lack luster items",3,Same old stuff,1222387200,"09 26, 2008"

I will however give the reasons as to why I recommend the Vita version over the 3ds. I own and have played the Vita version and compared it to my friend's 3ds copy.1- The vita has superior looking graphics. Partly due to the fact the game was designed around the Vita itself, partly due to the superior hardware of the Vita and partly because the Vita version has uncompressed graphics. It looks much nicer on the Vita. The 3ds version has compressed graphics when in comparison don't look nearly as good and if you try to play it in 3d the graphics take a slight dip even further as do all 3ds games. The widescreen aspect of the Vita also helps a lot. The colors are just more vibrant and sharper on the Vita.2- The sound is better on the Vita. Again it's due to the sound being uncompressed on the Vita while being compressed on the 3ds. It's slight, but noticeable.3- Game breaking save bug on the 3ds version. The 3ds version of the game in Japan had a bug in it which would destroy your save file and it has carried over into the American game. It's not guaranteed but a lot of people have run into it. If you save your game during certain portions of the game it will corrupt your save and you will have to start all over again. It's been verified by myself and others that the Vita version does not contain this problem.Other notes- The Vita version has trophy support if you're into collecting them. People have claimed the touch screen on the 3ds is far superior but what they don't understand is you can use a style on the Vita and get the exact same results, a simple and very cheap capacitive stylus works just fine on the Vita touch screen. I personally liked having everything on one screen instead of a split screen. You can take screenshots in the game. You get more save game slots while the 3ds has only one.All in all this is a great game and worth playing on either system but at the end of the day I cannot see any reason to not play it on the Vita as it is a better experience in every way.Sadly due to the numerous and glaring differences I could not rate the 3ds version higher.",3,Why you should buy the Vita version instead of the 3ds.,1358380800,"01 17, 2013"

6468,127251,A22UW60T9HWOKW,B002AB7TX8,apeman505,"[1, 1]","I got this game when it first came out because I like hard games, and I'm a fan of Atlus. To be honest, it didn't look all that interesting when I watched someone review it on youtube, but I got it anyway because there weren't many good ps3 games out yet, and it was heavily recommended.Anyway, as for my opinion of the game, I find it very meh.First off, I have to say the setting is very depressing, and the NPC's are generally either mopey or rude to you. That may be the main reason why I don't especially like this game, but admittedly it's not that big a deal.The combat has the potential to be interesting, but I find it more tedious than anything. It kind of reminds me of Monster Hunter, you either have light, fast weapons or heavy, slow ones. They extend this into the armor weight system as well--the more armored you are, the slower you move and the more useless the dodge button becomes. The unfortunate part is that almost all of the weapons and armor are borderline useless. You have to beat on people a whole heck of a lot before they die, and the armor doesn't really do a good job of protecting you. It could be argued that this makes the game harder, which I suppose it does, but in my humble opinion it just draws combat out unnecessarily and makes it almost a chore.There is also a parry button, which allows you to get in a one-hit kill if you do it right, and if you're able to get behind the bad guys you can also do a backstab for an insta-kill. I found this part of combat to be kind of fun, but you have to practice against all different kinds of attacks to get it down. You can also switch between one-handed and two-handed grips on your weapons, which is kind of cool.You collect the souls of the bad guys you kill, as well as those of deceased heroes that you find, and use them as currency. I find this kind of depressing and a little nonsensical. I mean, that sounds kind of evil, aren't we supposed to be the good guys? And you need a LOT of souls (excuse me, a lot of ""soul"") to buy or upgrade anything. The healing items you get are pretty useless and expensive, so you're better off just finding them in the field, and as I've said before, all the weapons are pretty crappy so you're better off just upgrading the stuff you start with at the beginning. (Besides, carrying more than one weapon weighs you down.)This is designed to be an online game, so there is no pause feature, which is a bit of a pain. It also makes arranging your equipment difficult, and I have to say I don't like the interface. Stats in the status screen are represented by weird characters that don't mean anything, although I am told there's a way to highlight them and make them tell you what they represent.The bad guys in this game are pretty cool and stylish, although their AI isn't the best since there are a number of known exploits out there. Actually, no I take that back. The bad guys aren't really stylish, they're mostly generic medieval soldiers, zombies, or skeletons with a few knights thrown in to mix it up.The bosses in this game are pretty awesome looking, and I have to say that the first big boss fight was pretty fun! (It was a big slime thing with shields all over its body) Sadly, the rest of the bosses, while they look cool, aren't very fun to fight. I've fought the Tower Knight and a giant spider, and they felt a little broken. While fighting the tower knight I felt as though my attacks should have had more effect, and that it was hitting me when it didn't make sense for him to be able to hit me. While fighting the giant spider, it was hard to tell just what the game wanted me to do in order to hurt it. I invited other players into my ""world"" to help me, but they all kept dying like crazy and were absolutely no help at all. When I finally killed the bosses in offline mode, I felt as though I'd wasted a lot of time rather than getting a sense of satisfaction.The levels themselves are likewise frustrating. There are myriad ways to get to the end of each level, which some people may enjoy, but I find this lack of direction kind of annoying. I personally don't like having to hunt all over the place in order to find where I'm supposed to go, and I don't like having to remember which path to take when there are a ton of them. That said, the graphic design of each level is awesome, even if they are very dark and depressing usually.One thing about the levels, however, is that they killed me way more than the boss fights. There are tons of death traps and ways to accidentally fall off of cliffs. The death traps are okay, in my opinion, but the fact that I keep falling off of cliffs I couldn't see was very annoying. Also, there are a lot of very slender walkways that you have to traverse and the controls are not very precise, if you catch my drift. Furthermore, the levels tend to be VERY long and convoluted, which makes getting back to where you died EXTREMELY tedious--it can take about an hour to get all the way through a level just to fight the boss again.All in all, I really wanted to like this game, but it didn't really live up to the hype for me. It's not as hard as everyone makes it out to be, but it is very, very tedious. Expect to spend a huge chunk of the day walking through the same level over and over again before you beat even one boss. Fun.",3,I feel like I'm missing something.,1399939200,"05 13, 2014"

Burns,"[3, 9]","In Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, A man from ancient times, Pious Augustus, has taken control of a terrible force and you play through a series of tasks as different characters that will eventually lead you to stopping Augustus from summoning the evil force that will eventually lead to the world's doom.There are three different ways to go about this game, depending on which artifact Pious Augustus chooses. This means that you will have to go through what is basically the same storyline three times. The lack of difference in the three paths makes the game rather boring; the only differences are what enemies you run into, the order in which you get the red, green, and blue runes, and slight differences in what the characters talk about. Everything else (the traps, the puzzles, etc.) is exactly the same in all three paths. You even go through all of the same stages, in the same order! ""yawn"" Boring.The gameplay time is very short; it takes only 10-20 hours to go through the storyline one time. And it get shorter everytime since you will most likely remember what you have to do to get to the next situation. Also, none of the enemies are all that difficult to get past. You almost never have to ration your ammunition for guns; ammunition is too abundant.The only thing you get for completing the game through all three paths is a cutscene.

7380,106184,AFLRU6952DEFX,B00178630A,S.,"[42, 58]","I've sat through an hour and a half of Diablo III, and honestly, it was boring.Maybe I'm a bit cynical, but I kind of saw all of this coming, from the first point hearing about the healing orbs (aka power ups) to the DRM fiasco.  Most if not all the original makers of the Diablo franchise left Blizzard years ago for other companies (Torchlight/ Torchlight 2), leaving a crew that's basically made WoW.  Unfortunately for them, that ship, WoW, has pretty much run its course.  With regards to D3, the criticism is not really a case of ""this isn't Diablo [II] enough"" but rather, this is all the bad sides of D2, with none of the good aspects (namely character customization and sort of a sandboxey go-where you like when you like feeling.  D3 100% linear guided tour, no choices, game on rails.).Take D2.  You had to grind through 2 difficulties before you got to the ""real"" difficulty level where all the good stuff dropped and the tough battles ensued.  Doing those quests for a the millionth time really sucked but hey, that's what you had to do.  And you decided which quests you wanted to do, and sometimes in what order, and could go pretty much wherever you wanted whenever you wanted as long as you killed the act bosses.  Only this time, in D3, you have to grind through 3 difficulties before you get to the final one.  At least this time they shortened the time it takes, but in a way that's a negative as well just because there is hardly 60 bucks worth of content.  In D2 the loot made things interesting, but in D3 the loot is super randomized and always improving but doesn't feel special.Think about it... would you rather play 60 hours of content on one difficulty level, or play 15 hours of content, four times repeated?  The second option sounds boring, and maybe in my misspent youth I would have gone for it, but now I think gamers know better.  Skyrim is looking like A LOT better value right now and at least is a real role-playing game. A roleplaying game is one where you take a risk, you invest in certain skills and skip others, and your character is a unique creation; you might have picked a good combo, or maybe not, but it was still your choice, your experiment.  In Diablo III, it's a socialist dystopia where everyone is perfectly equal and perfectly the same and perfectly boring.  If you want a character progression and choice over your path, don't just walk, run away from this title.Diablo III is a game inspired by RPGs, even the interface and town interiors look ripped from Baldur's Gate.  But the game itself really has more in common with Contra or Metal Slug, 2d shooter style games where you run around, shoot the baddies, get the power-up, etc etc.  The rune system later in the game makes this a little more complex, but is sorta like Contra where you earned different ways of shooting - everyone has access to the exact same runes (skill tweaks) at any time, and you can change them at the drop of a hat.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.Diablo III looks like a mishmash of Warcraft III, World of Warcraft, and Diablo.  It can't quite decide whether it wants to be scary or cute and colorful, so it does both. The monsters and scorched ground areas look ripped from the undead campaigns in Warcraft III.  Honestly, if someone had told me this was some sort of super mod for that game, I might have believed them, as the game looks more like I'd expect a Warcraft game than Diablo.  The Grotesque monsters, for example, are supposed to be nasty things that scratch and claw and then blow themselves up into a bloody mess.  But instead they look like Kirby from the Nintendo games or mini versions of the Stay Puffed Marshmellow Man from Ghostbusters.  Seriously, the monsters are for the most part just WoWish and don't look like they belong in a traditional fantasy universe (like Dungeons and Dragons).In the end, I can't believe it took them so long to develop what is essentially maybe 15-20 hours of content, strung along through repeated difficulties.  I'm sure someone will play this for hundreds of hours trying to get a marginally different styled armor for their cookie cutter character (since now there are really only as many character builds as there are character types).You can take Blizzard's side and say that ""streamlining"" the game was good, but in reality, every character is exactly the same looking and acting, minus whatever differences in gear happen.  All female wizards for example look EXACTLY alike and have no customization of skills, appearance, face, hair, etc., etc, and if you've seen one, you've seen them all.  This was acceptable in 2000, not in 2005 and certainly not now.  Neverwinter Nights, Guild Wars, and Elder Scrolls games all always offered more depth of who your character was. No replayability.I guess we can face it that this is an action game with customizable armor, but where apparently the physical damage of a held weapon determines your ability to shoot fire and lighting from your palms.  I'm sure someone will say that makes choosing a weapon easier, but it just makes the game make no sense, unless you look at it from the perspective of the developers not having the time or creativity to actually develop a convincing attack bonus system for casters.In a way, the makers are lucky that people are locked out of the game.  Everyone wanted more from D3 than they remembered from D2, and I think most people got much less than they were hoping for.  Bad voice acting, bad storyline, and neat but ultimately forgettable cinematics (probably the cause of all the delay -- Blizzard having to pay for and film the equivalent of a movie within a game).  A game that can't really decide if it's a single player game or an MMO, so it tries to do both and doesn't truly suceed.  This is MMO-light, probably for people who sadly don't have the experience to know what this game is missing.If this wasn't rentware, I'd give it 2 stars for at least having town interiors that reminded me of classic Bioware games. I haven't said much about the DRM and heavy server lag because everyone already knows the game is going to be somewhat crippled for a little while longer until either more people quit or Blizzard improves capacity.  I think it will be a fun game a year or two from now when it is patched and everything is rethought and the price is cut.  It is simply unplayable (lag, disconnects, 40 minutes of lost progress) at random times, and that's why my review is 1 star instead of 2 stars.Until then, save your money, and buy something else.  D3 just isn't in the same league as the other games mentioned, and it just isn't worth paying that much for a temporary game that will be unplayable the day Blizzard decides to pull the plug on their servers, which could be tomorrow or could be 10 years from now (the mighty can fall - just look at the banks and GM).In the end, you aren't paying for a game, you're paying for a subscription to their (laggy) servers, a MMORPG without the RPG and without the MM.Games which are IMO bettersome NWN games (NWN2 Mask of the Betrayer comes to mind, as do the expansions for the first NWN)Baldur's Gate series (and anything else made by Bioware with the infinity engine, including Planescape Torment and Icewind Dale)Dragon Age OriginsGuild Wars seriesElder Scrolls seriesTorchlight series",1,Saw this coming a mile away,1337472000,"05 20, 2012"

Heck, I'm one of them.  But the first Dawn of War game which launched in 2004 did something that the franchise could not do previously: it found a tremendous audience OUTSIDE of its own already dedicated and loyal followers.  Utilizing standard RTS formulas and somehow managing to find ways to reinvent them, Dawn of War quickly made it to a legendary status amongst RTS gamers.  To this day, the first Dawn of War still has a tremendous following, and with myriad expansions released between 2004 and 2008, there was always a reason to come back and play, especially since each expansion introduced brand new gameplay elements.  So what happened with Dawn of War 2?Frankly, Dawn of War II is actually 2 games in one.  Taking the standard RTS formula and once more reinventing it, Dawn of War II eschews the traditional mad dash for resources and army building and instead introduces core RPG elements and War Gear loot pickups during the campaign game.  Still emphasizing strategy, the player can choose from 6 different specialized Space Marine squads, including one Hero Commander that is the ""You"" character.  Each squad is represented by one of the most honored and revered Sergeants of the Blood Ravens Space Marine chapter, and can be customized to the player's liking.  Veterans of the tabletop game will instantly recognize the different types of Squads: Assault, Devastator, Tactical, Scout and eventually Dreadnought.  The Commander is a versatile unit that can be customized to the player's liking...whether you favor straight up melee combat, ranged combat, a mix of the two or tactical support, the Commander has abilities that suit any player's style.  During missions, the player then chooses from 3 of the 5 remaining squads to take along for the ride.Throughout each mission, certain objectives will come up that offer bonus Experience and additional War Gear.  Gone is the need to find resources and build a defensible base.  In true Warhammer 40K style, your squads are dropped ""into the maelstrom of battle"" as they're so fond of saying, and from there must complete their objectives.  There are checkpoints to capture so that you can retreat or reinforce.  Some objectives call for eliminating a specific target, while others require you to hold a position as swarms of foes attack.  You will return to the same locations many times, and during gameplay you may capture specific buildings that offer you bonuses such as multiple deployments, extra super-weapon uses, and other such benefits.  Often times these captured relics will come under attack, forcing you into defend missions that sometimes become overwhelming, especially on higher difficulties.As far as the game being 2 games in 1, the other half of the game is your standard RTS army building in Skirmish & Multiplayer mode.  Like the campaign mode, gone is the need to build bases as the Command Center will be your one-stop source for all of your units.  Those who enjoy hording resources will be happy, as Power Nodes and Requisition Points are once more there to be captured.  There are multiple game types, and the highly customizable armies (Space Marines now have different paint patterns) allow you to mix it up with 5 other players for a massive free-for-all or team combat.  There are some drawbacks in that army buildup is very slow, being that there is only one building that produces units.  Requisition and Power are also very slow to start out, and once you upgrade your HQ you must wait to build more units until the upgrade is complete, leaving you vulnerable.The story is great, with superb voice acting and instantly likable characters.  Fans rejoice, for your ranting and raving has paid off...Tyranids are HERE!  Focusing on a Tyranid Hive Fleet that has appeared in the Sub-Sector of Aurelia, the Blood Ravens find themselves plunged into a desperate war to decide the fate of their primary recruiting worlds.  As the odds are stacked ever against them, the Blood Ravens fight a war on all fronts, as the enigmatic Eldar and reckless Orks have also decided to lay waste to the sector.  Familiar faces and heroes from the previous Dawn of War games will also join you in your quest to destroy the Tyranid Hive Fleet.  The story progresses nicely, with optional missions popping up that offer more story insight.  There is even a cluster of side missions revolving around acquiring a new character for use in your squads.Now that we've covered the basic game, let's get to some technical issues:The squad AI can be...well, pretty darn dumb.  Ranged units will inexplicably charge into melee combat, while melee units will stand off to the side firing away with their weaker ranged weapon, if nothing at all.  Many times, issuing an attack order for one of your squads will simply make them charge headfirst into the swarm, instantly getting them killed.  Sometimes they will not respond to commands, and pathing issues may wind up sending your squad all the way around the map (again, getting them killed) to get to an open field less than half a screen away from them with a bridge leading right to it.  I have actually failed missions based on AI stupidity.  On the contrary, enemy AI can often be lethally cunning, even on the easiest difficulty.  This can either add more challenge or heap on the annoyance factor...whatever you feel like.Graphical glitches are few and far between, but they do exist.  If you're running a top of the line computer you should have no problem with the visual effects.  However, some technical bugs do show through.  Similarly, sound has few problems but sometimes the in-game volume can completely cut out, or unit responses to your selection will cease to play, requiring you to set all options to factory default, and then changing them back to your liking.And my least favorite...STEAM/Windows LIVE - DAMN YOU for taking over my game!  Let's face it folks, we're stuck with this for most games now.  It's their idea of fighting piracy, and as annoying as it is you can't let it be the deciding factor.  Frankly, I am sick and tired of customers ignorantly giving bad reviews to a game because it has to be played through Steam/Live.  Deal with it!  It is annoying yes, but it is not the game you should be complaining about.  To be honest, there have been a few occasions where my internet has cut out, and thus I wasn't able to play Dawn of War II.  Are you KIDDING ME?  I need to be on the internet to play a game that is installed on my computer?  Yeah, it enrages me but it isn't Dawn of War II that I'm going to bash for it.  It's that despicable Steam client and equally annoying WLID.This has also put a stranglehold on the modding community.  Sorry, but don't expect to see custom badges or units from anyone.So here's a final breakdown:Gameplay - 5/5: Love it or Hate It...there seems to be no in-between.  The tremendous change from straight up RTS to RTS/RPG hybrid will leave a sour taste in the mouths of some, while others such as myself will love the element of strategy and squad customization involved.  If you tire of the hybrid play style of the campaign, the skirmish mode is always available for your more classic tastes.  Multiplayer is a blast, even if Zerging is still a problem. Campaign ending is also rather disappointing.Sound - 5/5: Explosions, weapon discharges and screams of bloody death fill the battlefield at all times.  The superb voice acting creates extremely likable characters with dramatic dialogue and the music inspires you to keep fighting the good fight.Control - 4/5: Feels a little sloppy at times but give me keyboard and mouse over console controller any day.Accessibility - 3/5: An easy-to-use interface, a custom army painter and a recently included map editor make this game a joy to play.  Finding online matches can take some time but is easy.  However, the invasive and infectious Steam client can completely ruin your day by refusing to allow you to play your own game at its leisure.  Offline mode does not always work!Overall - 5/5: Minor technical issues and ethical questions about Steam aside, DoW II is fantastic and has once more set the standard for RTS gaming.  Though some may have minor issues (No Chaos?  No base building?) it will continue to win over fans.PROs:- RTS/RPG hybrid allows for high level of customization- Well written and superbly voice-acted storyline- Diverse environmental terrain allows for different tactics and a ""more than one way"" approach to missions- Optional missions always available to gain more War Gear and Experience- Custom Army Painter has more options than previous games- Multiplayer and single player skirmish is close enough to previous games to draw in standard RTS crowds- Highly addicting and plenty of Achievements to EarnCONs:- Questionable squad AI leads to needless deaths- Certain missions (such as ""Defense"" missions) are nearly impossible at higher difficulties- Though very rare, glitches can severely hinder gameplay- Optional missions get repetitive quicklyAs it stands, Dawn of War II is one of my all-time favorites.  In fact, it's running in the background right now at the time of this writing.  Enjoy!",5,Dawn of War 2: A new direction that still delivers!,1278115200,"07 3, 2010"

My Husband prefers the Xbox 360 over our Playstation 3, but has both consoles since some games are console specific. The Xbox 360 controller is also our favorite. This Wireless PS3 controller is very similar to the Xbox 360 controller layout. It is also lighter in weight than both the Xbox 360 and PS3 original controllers. It has a very soft, grippable exterior and fits very comfortably in your hands.Upon initial use the controller worked great and my Husband was very pleased with it. I don't know what exactly makes them say it is a &#34;sports&#34; controller, but we tested it out with several games including a Lord of the Rings and Forza. It performed great and my Husband was happy to have it. We also used this controller to watch Blu-Rays on the PS3. We used it for hours and it was fine. Then, about 3 weeks later when watching Pacific Rim on Blu-Ray we pressed the fast forward button to get to the spot we had stopped watching the movie earlier. When we went to press play...nothing. The controller lost signal. We plugged the controller in to the PS3 and it worked for a little while. Then it stopped working AGAIN while plugged in.Since this happened we have tested the controller several times and the controller functions on and off. Sometimes it will work for awhile, but then you are in the middle of a battle scene and it stops working on you. Not cool. A controller that only works sometimes is garbage.We really liked the esthetics and feel of this controller and probably would have given it 5 stars if it continued to work. Maybe our controller was faulty? This hope and the fact that we like the design a lot is accounting for my 3 stars. Either way, I can not recommend the controller because of this.",3,Loved this controller until it stopped working,1385164800,"11 23, 2013"

Even with a small discount code I had it was pushing $170.  I would only recommend this if you need to stay quiet during your game time, such as apartment dwellers like myself, staying quiet for the spouse, kids, dog, etc.-Wireless:  Both a pro and con.  I have my wireless router 1 foot away from my xbox which I have to keep the receiver for the headset by because I have to connect the USB power to the xbox.  By doing this my wireless router interferes with the ear force receiver, giving it a loud cracking/popping noise every few seconds.  I had to disconnect the router and hard wire the xbox to the modem and turn the wireless router off.-Volume:  You cannot even hear anything on the headset until you turn the volume dial halfway.  Now I will admit that the loudest setting should be plenty in a completely quiet room, but if there is a lot of background noise, for example a lawn mower in the backyard the volume may not be enough to drown that out.Now that all the cons are out of the way, I can say that the sound on this headset is EXCELLENT.  Of course you will not get a TRUE surround sound experience, but being able to hear every little detail at 2 am is just great.  The microphone is adjustable and detachable so you can store it away if using your headset for a late night movie session.And you can also use this with the PS3!  I tested out a few blu ray movies and found that some of the audio formats were not working with the headset.  I am not a big audio expert, so I am not sure if I was doing something wrong so I am not going to knock points off for that.  I was testing out Rambo in case anyone wants to try it out.If you are able to keep the surround sound at 11 at night, by all mean keep doing that and skip this.

Driving across the USA in a long race, thats never been done, and its fun.* It is a superb driving game for the fun factor and varied intensity!* Car handling is tight. Pretty simple, depending on your car choice though.* The maps go through various landscape types, from towns, to deserts, to curvy mountains, dodging icy avalanches, country roads, and its all unique and creative. I'm not sure if its built to scale with any real roads, but it could pass as if!* You'll sometimes find shortcuts and they really help. And not just normal ""hey look a sooner turn"" but ""hey look an abandoned building dodging boxes and cranes"" or ""hey look a ramp down by the coast dodging rocks and sand"" and yes they will put you a bit ahead so take them.* Some races are just totally awesome. I've played almost every good racing game since the SNES and this game will have your jaw dropping sometimes :O!* You will find yourself glued to beating every race, its addictive and streamlined.* The music is decent. Its not pop or mainstream, just generic rock background but it actually works.* The intro and occasional action events are a decent switch up from the norm. Like when you get busted in vegas, you have to run from the cops and its pretty cool.* The game unlocks side missions as you play the game, so you can have more fun when you beat it.* The races are quite challenging, even on Normal setting, and you'll find yourself needing to pay attention and ""play perfect"" almost always. For a racing-game fan, this is great fun.Cons:* The game CHEATS! When you clearly knocked an opponent off the course, he will somehow come back and pass you in a minute or often times at the last second.* NOS (Nitrous) is pretty much useless in this game. If you use it, other cars nearby use it too, and theirs seems infinite when yours is not. But if you get slowed down, so do they. Its almost better not to use NOS...* A pro/con in one: If you make a mistake, they ""reset"" you and time to the last checkpoint. But the problem is that, if you barely even tip, TIP! outside the course (an arrow wall or grassy shoulder) it will reset you. And if you want to restart the whole event it takes forever, even installed to the x360 HDD! Bad.* A personal opinion, but the main character is lame and cheesy. So is the main girl. I wish the game would've been a bit wittier. Like in the desert if she had said ""dust yourself off jack"" or in the icy mountains if she said ""stay frosty jack"" you know that sort of thing. But no. Just ""stay sharp. be safe. ok will do"". kinda lame.* Sometimes you will have moments and even whole races where you'll be like ""OH SNAP that was the best EVER!""... but the game has no recording ability. The Run could've used a movie recording ability. Some moments are just that good.* The gas stations you'll stop at to change your cars is a cool idea, but you'll only see them once every few maps, and theres usually only 1 or 2 good options (Nissan or BMW), plus stopping in will let others pass you.* They needed a car upgrade system to make the game even more epic. Thats optional I suppose.* I played it on the x360 and it was smooth. I tried it on a good PC build too and it was too choppy. Note this.Overall, it is a fun game to play. I got the game for free so I gave it more leniency, but if I had paid $40-60 I might be flipping tables at times.

Rush Jr. ""Scorpion""","[0, 0]","Outside of the fundamental approach to the casual 3D fighting style of Mortal Kombat there were several unique qualities added into the mix that brought some sparkle to the platform. One such mark of interest was the fact that you can ram opponents through obstacles and battle mash your buttons in a struggle to reduce or reverse damages. The game definitely has its moments where the intelligence of the game developers surfaces and it isn't too shabby.Essentially, I am a fan of Batman, Mortal Kombat (primarily the character Scorpion), and fighting games in general. The fact that game comes off a bit dry at times really doesn't hinder me while playing due to the fact that there are hidden characters and the like as incentive to stay somewhat focused. I, however, cannot confirm but, suspect that when the appeal of the hidden ""easter-eggs"" has worn down the game's re-playability will take a fatal head dive to the mat.It is fun for the sake of having a Mortal Kombat cross-over especially considering that the D.C. character line-up: The Flash, the Joker, Batman, Cat-woman; etc. are all well done, all faithfully reproduced, and in strong character. The MK characters that you would demand be present are all there with the same being so for the D.C. Universe line-up.The game has dropped dramatically in price, covers a niche pretty well, has strong Mortal Kombat fighting mechanics and no chump character line-ups.

Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy will always have a soft spot for me because they made me into the RPG fanatic grown up I am today. I bought the FF1 remake on PS1 back when they remade it as Final Fantasy origins and still own it.  But this version sounded interesting and it was $9.99 so I thought 'what the heck'!But I was at first disappointed right away when I noticed that the cost in shops was half what it was in the original.  For example, instead of 100 gil, the spells are 50 gil.  So when before I started with Fighter, Red Mage, White Mage, and Black Mage I could by 2 chain mail, two cloth, weapons for each and then have gil for two spells (usually fire for black mage and Cure for white mage).  This version I had enough gil to almost purchase the max spells for each of the three magic users.  Hmph.The magic system is also different.  You still buy the spells and you have a max of three per magic user per level.  But they use MP instead of the limit of use per spell per level.  This wouldn't be an issue, except that they give you TONS of MP.  So cure costs 4 mp and I have about 70 mp at level 4... sad...The battles are a little easier too it seems.  I find that my characters are hitting better than in the original and getting multiple hits easier.  My red mage was getting 2 hits per attack starting with level 2 or 3!I feel that perhaps SquareEnix wanted to ease off the 'level grinding' that was common with the older RPGs and modernize the game.  Which is fine.  But they totally nerfed the difficulty.  I wouldn't mind if there was an option to change the difficulty settings... but I remember seeing that game over screen quite a few times during my FF1 playing days.If you haven't played the original Final Fantasy, then I would recommend downloading an original NES version ROM and playing through FIRST before playing this version.  This version is nice, and the graphics and music are amazing... but there is really no challenge.  At least not like the original.  If you play the NES version, you will spend a lot of time level grinding and building up gil (unless you do the frost wolf peninsula cheat with Fir2 !).  For extra challenge, try beating FF1 on an emulator without using save states outside of an Inn.  Ahaaaaaaa!  Oh, and the dialogue is pretty odd in parts...  Kind of fun though.Regardless, this is a very good game, and it's a nice dose of nostalgia.

11830,116759,A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,B001IKHVTE,Moviedude,"[2, 2]","With Diablo, Torchlight, and Borderlands all having lavish sequels, it's a good time to look back at Ascaron's Sacred sequel, which ended up being their final game before bankruptcy and closure.The original Sacred was something of a sleeper hit. With solidly 2d environment graphics (the characters were 3d) it actually looked a little more dated than Diablo 2, but it had a very clean sharp aesthetic and its intense customization, huge open world, and streak of cheeky naughtiness made it a star, particularly with older gamers. In my heady college days it was a recurring LAN party favorite, although Titan Quest effectively dethroned it.Sacred 2 was a bold attempt to do all that Sacred 1 did but with modernity. Now in full 3d, with a detail level comparable to Oblivion, dynamic lighting, and tons of environments, Sacred 2 was certainly a quantum leap forward in looks for the series. It also features a huge volume of voice acting, customizable skills (narrowly sneaking in ahead of D3's rune system) and just as many Easter eggs and rare items as its predecessor.And yet, something about Sacred 2 feels off. The controls feel a little less responsive, and the skills feel less balanced- generally within an hour of starting you will know what moves your character will use for the rest of the game. The world is huge and visually gorgeous, yet you feel very confined to artificial paths through it- much of what you see on the map is inaccessible obstacle terrain, and by the final quarter of the game it has become hopelessly linear. And while the characters look vastly better than they did in the first title, they lack the appealing oddball character of the characters in the original (with the exception of the inquisitor, an awesome villain-protagonist who seems to be channeling Emperor Palpatine by way of a Luc Besson gangster film). Sacred 2 bombards you with exotic locations and numerous characters, but they quickly become a slog, a grindy obstacle course you shoot your way through without paying much attention. In Sacred 1 there was a joy to discovering new areas, but in spite of the lavish artistry on display 2 does not capture this fun.Part of the problem may also be the story. Sacred 1 had a pretty easy to follow one: There is an evil wizard who has summoned a demon and you must go swat them, and also a crooked baron who is using the chaos to take over the kingdom. In the expansion it was boiled down further to ""go to hell and rescue this lady."" Sacred 2 has a huge incomprehensible plot which is never well explained, but which I will try to summarize:-God is an alien-The Seraphim (chesty warrior cyborg women with a predilection for laser guns and jailbait haircuts) work for God but they get tired of doing nothing all day, so they build their own planet (this all directly contradicts the lore of the first game in which Seraphim were mutant elves bred to fight demons but whatevs)-The Seraphim's crapsack planet goes all to pot, the inhabitants all start fighting and the pipes that pump the planet's power source (a blue goo called T-Energy) start bursting, mutating wildlife into monsters and also somehow teaching people magic-The morally gray elven government finds the source of all T-energy, a wrecked spaceship that the Seraphim apparantly did NOT build, and which is full of robot dog men-Everyone starts fighting over T-energy and you have to make your way to the spaceship and fight giant robot ants so you can either shut it off or exploit its powerNot one bit of this makes sense or is worth following, and indeed the game is at its best when you are engaging in a series of unrelated quests.I am picking on Sacred 2 awfully hard, but the truth is that it was a step in the right direction. Unlike Sacred 1, it was visually modern, sumptuously designed, and in spite of being total nonsense, worth playing at least once. If you choose to however, I recommend against this version. The more complete Sacred 2 Gold, which includes the Ice and Blood expansion is now available on Steam, and while you can modify the US release of Sacred 2 to accept the Europe-only expansion, the all-in-1 represents a better value proposition.Mention must also be made of multiplayer: It was horribly laggy at launch, and as far as I know, is now dead (unless current IP owner Deep Silver maintains it). Were I you I would not buy this game expecting a satisfying coop experience.PROS:-Looks Great-Soundtrack includes music by German epic metal legends Blind Guardian!-Tons of skills, loot, and customization-Huge gameworld to exploreCONS:-Less rewarding and re-playable than Sacred 1 or many competing contemporaries-Awkward feel to controls-Largely forgettable cast-Quickly becomes numbingly easy-Little incentive to complete higher difficulties-Requirements far exceed what you get visuallyOTHER NOTES:-The collector's edition of this game came with a high-def texture pack that confers lag-inducing beauty upon the world. You can download this both as an official patch and unofficial mod pack.-One of the game's strongest points is that each character has their own campaign alongside the main story, and this campaign further changes depending on your alignment. This feature was meant to appear in Sacred 1, but except for the Vampiress, all the character's arcs end when the reach the first hub town.-Sacred 1 was released censored for violence in the US. Not so with 2; you can dismember your enemies with abandon now.-For all its mucking about with Canon, Sacred 2 is a solid prequel in many ways. The high elven society in 2 will eventually collapse into the aescetic wood elves and depraved, decadent dark elves of the first title, and the Dryads will eventually be trapped in the underworld by the time of the first game. Dwarves, for some reason, are absent from Sacred 2, although by all rights they should be all over the place. Then again, this game could easily be a prequel in name only, nothing that happens in-game explicitly precedes the first title.-The high elf's story arc is entirely about her trying to get out of Student Loan debt.

7221,6504,A10FEGI2FQD7L9,B00002SU5A,Christopher Jantze,"[101, 115]","I am a huge fan of vampire fiction in any form and also enjoy a good RPG.  So I was ecstatic when I heard about Vampire being translated from the pen-and-paper sources to the computer.  And Vampire is an amazing looking  game that I really wanted to like.  Unfortunately some bad design choices  and poor features prevented it from happening.I'll start with the good  points.  The graphics are stunningly amazing.  The animation of the  characters is fluid and weapons are superbly done.  The lighting greatly  enhances the dark and sinister atmosphere.  I kept going in many places  because I wanted to see what area I would visit next.  The camera control  is also very smooth and easy to manipulate with the mouse.  The gameplay is  actually fun for the first bit of the game while you are adventuring by  yourself and with one other party member.  The source material and the  manual add a lot to this game.  Wandering around towns and seeing people  milling about made it feel alive.  And it was always oh so fun to feed upon  someone to refill your blood level.The RPG system is also great.  There  are several positive and detrimenatl traits for the characters.  A certain  level of blood must be maintained to use the disciplines (spells/skills)  and to keep your character from succombing to frenzy.  Experience points  can be distributed among such traits as strength, dexterity, intelligence,  willpower and several others.  Very nicely done indeed.Here is where I  have to get in to the demerits of this game.  First off, the voice acting  is not very good; but it's not the worst I've heard either.  And the  sequences of dialogue are long and boring.  The characters simply stand in  place and wave their hands about.  NPC interaction is left to a few  choices which really have little baring on the outcome of the game.  Nothing as rich and detailed as Planescape: Torment.The combat, while  fun and reminiscent of Diablo, only keeps its spark for the first part of  the game.  Most of it consists of clicking on an enemy and waiting until  you've hit them enough times for them to die.  A big flaw that becomes  noticable during the first few levels is that the enemies wait until you  are in range before they attack.  They will simply stand idle as you  slaughter others in the same room!  As the game progresses you will gain  party members, and will bemoan similarly incompetant AI.  I equipped one  with a bow and laughed in disbelief as he continuously fired in to a wall  when he should have moved a couple steps to the side before doing so.  Also, you can control the other members of your party in combat, but the  main character will stop fighting while you are doing so!  Aaahhhh!  Add to  this that you can go through entire areas and clean up with little to no  problem, but then come across certain areas that will be nigh impossible to  pass.  Both enemies and your fellow party members will get hung up on  walls, doors and other obstacles in the room.And here we come to the  worst sin of the game, the save system.  Saving is automatically handled  when you transition between levels are areas.  The only other way to save  is to be in your haven or safe area.  One can get there by using the Walk  the Abyss discipline (aka spell/skill).  But it takes a while before you  have one of these in a given area.  So we are left hacking our way back  through areas and levels already completed.  I found myself abusing the  autosave feature by running back and forth between levels to save.  But  what if more than one person is playing the game as is the case on my  computer?  It's pretty much tough luck.  This is a computer game, not a  console.  The game should have been balanced so that players could save  anywhere at anytime.The multiplayer sounds enticing with the ability for  one person to take control of the NPCs and monsters.  But if the gameplay  is similar to the single-player then I can't see it being much  better.With great graphics, a rich source material and so much  potential.  It makes me sad to not be able to like this game.  This takes  me back to Revenant, another game with a lot of potential but came up  flacid.  Maybe the patches will fix the problems, I certainly hope so.  But  much has to be done for the AI to make this game worthy.",2,"Beatiful but bad AI, unbalanced gameplay, &amp; lousy saves",960768000,"06 12, 2000"

8711,27232,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000063LK3,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[12, 12]","This was one of the first games I played on my old P166MMX,  Even if you're computer is powerful enough to run the New JK game (Outcast), and especially if you haven't played that many of the newer FPS games like those based on Unreal or QuakeIII I'd still recommend playing this one first.Though a seeming sequel to The earlier Dark Forces, leaps in technology and set design make JK so much more.  In short, JK is fantastic - combining all the elements of great gaming and linking up the various levels into a single tight storyline - it's as close as you may have come to feeling as if you were in a Star Wars movie.You play as Kyle Katarn - a freebooter who turned on the empire, but never went over completely to the rebels.  Kyle is on the trail of a Dark Jedi named Jerec who (this being SW) killed Kyle's father.  Unfortunately for Kyle, Jerec is not just a dark jedi, but a dark jedi lord - the sort of guy who cruises the galaxy in a mother-huge battlecruiser surrounded by clouds of tie fighters.  Besides an army of jedi apprentices (""who ya' callin' 'padawan'?"") Jerec is more than capable of handling any danger - something he proves in one of the cutscenes that open the game.  (People have mixed feelings about the cutscenes, but I loved them, and thought they held up pretty well next to the movies, and that was BEFORE I saw ""Phantom Menace"".)  Jerec has little time for Kyle - he's more interested in finding the lost ""Valley of the Jedi"", a sort of Jedi's Graveyard holding the energy of countless deceased knights.  You'll be well into the game before you've even begin confronting Jerec's forces directly - by then realizing that your mission has less to do with revenge than saving the galaxy.The game has about 20 levels - with problem solving sometimes being more important than marksmanship.  The game has you traveling to fewer different planets than the original DF - this makes the story more coherent and progressive though , in the final levels, it does drag the story out. (On the planet of the Valley, you go from rocky canyons surrounding an imperial excavation to the excavation itself, then into the dig, then down through the subterrenean imperial installation in the excavation, going deeper and deeper into the planet - and it all seems to last forever).  Some of the level ideas are brilliant - the cargo-transport tubes of Nar Shadaa, the aquaducts of Sulon, the insides of Jerec's tower at Baron's Hed and the tumbling innards of a spaceship that is about to crash.  Through it all, the sound effects and John Williams' score remain truthful to Star Wars.  The game is a techno masterpiece, but it's plotting and level design point can't be chalked up to pentium computers with good hardware acceleration.  (After JK, my next FPS was Quake2, which was not as good.  Star Trek: Elite Force, was another great shooter, but despite better graphics, one only sometimes matching JK in storyline and level design, and soemtimes falling behind it despite the greater technology available).I ran this game on my P166 with a 12mb 3DFx card and had no problems.  It ran sort of okay on my winXP P4, though there were hiccups I could probably pass of on my Savage4 card.  One caveat - LucasArts released an expansion disk using an updated engine: Mysteries of the Sith, which lacked the FMV cut scenes or tighter storyline of JK, but offered much more challenging levels.  I bought JK in 1999 when it was packaged with MotS, but I doubt this edition has it similarly bundled.

That's perfectly understandable, being that you play it simply with hand gestures, but aside from said gestures tying in somewhat obviously with the musical score of the game, there doesn't seem to be much else to really determine why you're supposed to do certain gestures when or where, aside from just shooting a bunch of ""viruses"" attacking the Internet (""Eden"").For novelty's sake, Child of Eden is worth checking out, but using a scale that friends of mine employ for films, this one, to me, is more of a ""rent it, don't buy it"" kinda game.

Resident Evil is another example of how you can make a games, which looks great graphically, but is barely playable in terms of controls.To begin with, just to start the game you have to push the following sequence of buttons (or, more like ""push the same button so many times""): Start, X, X , X, X, X, Down, Down, X, X... Are you freaking kidding me???And it's the same throughout the game: every time you need to go to a next Act, or to restart a game because you got killed, it's a miriad of X pushes. Even to upgrade a weapon you have to push X to select the upgrade, then confirm Upgrade by pushing X again, then confirm the confirmation by pushing X again, then when it's upgraded you have to push X yet again to the message that the upgrade has been installed. HOLY COW!!! Who in the hell did come up with this stupidity???Now, I don't know why it was even considered as an option, let alone the ONLY option available, to completely STOP a player in his/her place to shoot and even to reload a gun. But it does seem like every playable character in the game is a complete idiot, unable to handle more than one task at a time: you can either move, or you can shoot, or you can reload your gun, but never the combination of moving and one of the other two.Aiming is also weird: while you're rooted in place, you have to find where in the hell the laser line ends, which is nearly impossible without a full (stereo) 3D, because you can't really tell how far it ends, because it can be pretty much anywhere on the screen (not centered as in the majority of games where you have to aim).The control scheme is the worst of all games in the world. I've complained on bad controls in other games, of course, but nothing comes close to RE5 in this regard: I doubt you can come up with the worst controls for decades to come.As far as the storyline is concerned - it's japanese, so it's all ridiculously cheesy and convoluted, just like pretty much all other japanese games that managed to reach the West. I know some people might like it, so take this as my personal opinion :)All in all, the controls completely ruined the game for me. The graphics are amazing (although the PS3 version, as usual, have gotten a shorter end of a stick, with jaggies appearing/disappearing all the time because of the ""dynamic"" antialiasing, framerate drops, which also causes control lagginess, and many other graphical compromises here and there that have already been mentioned by the [...] reviewers.",1,Nothing amazing and nothing  new,1236902400,"03 13, 2009"

7287,85977,A2PT1M0S0S3AOP,B000QTD05C,Johnathan Doler,"[4, 22]","You know when I witnessed the local kids playing Resident Evil Code Veronica X you have no idea the level of dread I felt for the future of the series. These were kids who started playing the series once Code Veronica was ported form the DreamCast to the PS2 and instantly shunned the original Resident Evil games on the PlayStation (one of these kids, the leader of the idiot team of course was only one year younger than me).Unfortunately, my dread became vivid and has stayed vivid onward. Resident Evil is never going to be the unique little adventurous, ultra gory, atmospheric little Alone in the Dark rip-off I remember it as because when a company considers three of the most broken, overly action packed, laughable additions to the series as 'essential,' then something is very wrong. The atmosphere that the Resident Evil that was introduced in 1996 (thirteen years ago) is NEVER coming back and it's all thanks to its so-called sequels that were almost entirely dedicated to nothing but action.Seriously, look at what they have: Resident Evil Code Veronica X, the port of the all ready overly action packed jerk-fest with a John Woo gunslinging Leonardo Dicaprio dork and a one dimensional antagonist with the addition of a character who magically survived the previous games by a continuity error that was later explained in Umbrella Chronicles in that classic five year old ""because I said so"" excuse solely so said character could be the equivalent of The Terminator meets The Matrix.Then there's Resident Evil Outbreak, the first online survival horror game ever made and quite  possibly the worst (second only to Outbreak file #2) with more of those random cameo characters the developers loved so much they had to include them in the game by snapping the continuity in pieces. Add to the broken single-player game play with some of the most obnoxious enemy AND friendly AI ever made and some of the most atrocious enemy designs made and you've got pain elemental in one game.Then you've got EVERYONE's favorite blend of Hollywood action slop and campiness, 4resident evil (hey, that's literally how it's spelled), a game where the only fear you'll get is laughing yourself to death he moment you see the so called 'terrorists' you're fighting. I just need to ask: What are game developer's obsession with playing the role of alpha male in games? Does a game become an instant classic when you have a to baby sit a foxy young woman in loose clothes who can't defend herself, whose first lines are literally ""Don't come?"" I'm serious, that's the first line she has! You know what happened to games where you have to rescue a woman who screams those words at you??The latter game proves one thing about our generation of horror gaming: If I ever need money and I know how to develop a game, I'll just rip off Splinter Cell and Metal Gear Solid, throw in some heads popping every time the character so much as breathes on them coupled with rag doll physics, have some pervert in an overcoat sell you nasty things you can fit on to your gun in exchange for illogical fetch-quests and mini-games, throw in maybe one or two monsters and have you defend a hot, foxy woman in an iron lung and call it a horror game.

7036,18730,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005LOXE,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 1]","Games that were released in the Super NES' heyday have been often named some of the best games ever released. Despite dated graphics, not-as-deep storylines or interaction-heavy gameplay, people still hold these games in huge regard and not just for nostalgia value. While personally I would've put Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger in one package, we still get Final Fantasy IV instead so it doesn't really matter. I'll do each game separately.Chrono TriggerStory: Crono is attending the Millennium Fair in Leene Square. He encounters a young girl named Marle who has a strange pendant and she tags along. While trying out Crono's scientist friend Lucca's new invention, Marle gets sent to the year 600 A.D. Crono goes after her and soon uncovers a future that is destructive to say the least.Graphics: Probably the best looking of the games on this package. Sprites are well-detailed, graphics are colorful and there's a certain charm among many of the different time periods. But the overworld graphics look genuinely ugly.Sound/Music: No VA but the music by Yasonuri Mitsuda is outstanding as always. The music tends to range from eerie atmospheric music to upbeat ones and even rock. My one complaint is that at times there's sections where a piece of music would be perfect for an event but then you get in a battle and that upbeat theme kills the mood.Gameplay: CT introduced many types of ideas including the New Game+ where you can replay the game and get a different ending depending on when in the game you beat it. Also characters get special skills in battle which you can combine with other members to create more powerful spells. Frog and Crono can combine to create a swordsman skill but combine Crono and Lucca and he can use Fire-based sword attacks and so on.Final Fantasy IVStory: You are Cecil of the Red Knights and are ordered to do some rather morally questionable things which gets him kicked out. He finds out that Golbez is plotting to steal the world's crystals and throw the world into chaos so it's up to you and a diverse group to save the world.Graphics: Let's face it, these graphics now look iffy. While a lot of people can manage playing a game with visuals like these, you still look at it and notice how far along things have gotten.Sound/Music: No VA but Final Fantasy IV is often regarded as Nobuo Uematsu's first genuine sonic masterpiece. Me? I think he started hitting his stride with VI. Don't get me wrong, IV has a lovely soundtrack but I find myself listening to VI and up's soundtracks more.Gameplay: Like games such as IX or VI, IV has distinct job classes, offering party members with specific skills. You have Cecil with his dark attacks, Kain with dragoon jumps, summoners, monks and bards. Other than that it's fairly straightforward and familiar from levelling up to item hunting and whatnot so there's nothing new but then again IV made a lot of things new so go figure.My one complaint out of the entire package is that CT has some annoying slowdown where there's a fair amount of delay going into battle and your menus but then again it has some nifty anime cutscenes as well as IV's FMV's so all in all, it's a good package for RPG fans.",5,"2 classic games, one package",1189814400,"09 15, 2007"

They have earned the title of delivering the most elite fighting games ever.  So its not hard to be a little freaked out when they unleash a game like Kill.Switch.  If you asked me, I'd say that they derived the idea from their lackluster, action game Dead to Rights.  Neither impressive or a must-have title, Kill.Switch sadly shares a similar fate.  The game does in fact fume out a bag of potential, but what it lacks has transformed itself into grave issues that scatter in it.  Gamers may in turn be soured by having lost their money, when they could have purchased another game at the same price tag.Kill.Switch looks as if it were inspired by Metal Gear and other countless games that follow Snake Pilsken's trend.  Not to mention a lot of mindless, senseless, kill-anything-that-moves gameplay.  We live in a reality where we are told to be the ""good guys,"" and consequentially, it was a pleasant surprise to take the role of a super solider being controlled by a man plotting utter ruination of the world.  He wants all countries warring with each other, to inspire fingers of the world to press the kaboom button.  That's where disappointment reigns, Namco does not amplify the story so the player can be as engrossed as it sounds.  Nor does he even care about the character he mans.  Instead he is forced to do the game's ultimate bidding; to gun and gun because it's filthy fun.The action consists of a third person and if desired, first person, view to get into the gun fest.  Basically you run into every level and spray bullets at enemy targets.  The mission layouts don't really augment your experience or juice up imaginations.  Most objectives, varied in each mission, simply has the player reach the end of the stage and perform redundant things such as planting explosives.  Extremely feather-light on the difficulty aspect, Kill.Switch's trademark relies on its blind fire concept.  Its sure seemed like it would push the fun factor, but how can it when its utterly useless?  Blind fire rarely ever hits the target while the player shields himself behind cover and throws away streams of bullets.  The player can just easily rush his assailants with an arsenal of weapons.  Forced to find cover when pitted with an excess of enemy soldiers, the game does emanate a sense of entertainment by the unmotivated yet nonstop action.  Kill.Switch's combat is startlingly fast.What really has me vexed is Namco filling the game with excellent and running-silky-smooth graphics.  I mean why waste all  of that effort for a mediocre, run and gun game?  The lighting effects are solidly done with awesome shadow effects.  The models are boosted all around in a nice myriad of fluid textures.  Vividly bright, the sight of breaking windows and swirling, sandy air helped me get into the combat.  The music is downright unremarkable with retro, poppy, techno sounds that seem to sloppily bounce.There is this gut feeling that Namco could have gone somewhere special with the game and make it deeply engaging.  I`m tired of playing as the blonde, blue-eyed hero in videogames.  I want to be an entity of villainy architect, set out to destroy what the ""good"" cling onto.  Namco let the opportunity slip away by spoon-feeing players with a boring turn of events.  They have drowned players by keeping the game abruptly concluded with no supplemental material.  Aside from that the gameplay keeps the game worth getting into, no matter if its only a weekend or two.  Kill.Switch is not worth the price of ownership, for it needs more than little touches here and there, it calls for an invasion of them.",2,Not Worth  the Price of Ownership but an Upright Rental,1070236800,"12 1, 2003"
9993,34751,AFNCXMCX7VZWH,B00007KQC4,"J. Jongeling ""slice of heaven""","[3, 4]","Resident Evil 2 is easily one of the most fun and enjoyable games that has come out in the past decade. It scares you enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, but the difficulty level is set exactly right so it doesn't get you frustrated. Not to mention that both of the playable characters have two missions, and once you complete those, there are several different gameplay modes rewarded to the player for completing the missions. This enhances the game's replay value quite dramatically.So assuming that you have played this game on the original Playstation, I bet you're wondering what is different about the port offered on the Gamecube?Well, disappointingly enough, not much. The RE2 port is just that - a port. Naturally, however, the Gamecube is a much more advanced system capable of handling much faster polygonal rates, shading, texture, and load times. The overall look is a bit smoother, but not enough to make you say ""wow!"". More like ""hmmm...interesting"". The blood is not so polygonal, and the characters are a bit smoother. If there really is any difference in the load time, it is minimal. The controls are about as good as the original - pending that you can get used to the game on a Gamecube controller. The CMVs are not changed at all. Nothing smoother, nothing overdubbed, nothing brighter or duller, not faster or slower. This can either be a curse or a blessing for you, depending on how devoted you are to the original CMV's, as the CMVs are identical to the Playstation's in every way.So while I can't really justify owning a copy of Resident Evil 2 for the Gamecube, I would recommend it to anybody who has never played the game or does not have access to the PS version of it. Resident Evil 2 is a great game, and it continues to hold its value even to this day. If Capcom would have just done the same thing for RE2 and RE3 that they did for the original, I think we would have probably the best series in history on our hands. However, CAPCOM got lazy and decided to port the rest of the titles. Too bad, so sad.So to sum it up, if you currently own Resident Evil 2 for the Playstation, save your money because the Gamecube version is really not all that much better.Original game rating and contents = 9/10""lazy"" Gamecube port rating = 2/10final score on the re-release for the Gamecube = 4/10",2,Resident Evil 2 for the Gamecube,1139356800,"02 8, 2006"

I bought heart of the Swarm on hte day of release and finished the campaign within a week.The campaign alone is worth buying this game. The expansion is great as well. Multiplayer can be fun, but I tend to get frustrated with it. I enjoy big battles, and when someone rushes in early to win, I simply capitulate. I simply do not have time to waste. I am not a competitive player, so when someone ruins a match like that it upsets me.Overall, this is the best Real Time Strategy (RTS) game out there.

8101,195605,A2IYMICID58831,B006JI3Q7G,Travis Chaffee,"[1, 1]","FIFA 12 on consoles is widely hailed as one of the best sports simulations ever created. The series as a whole has racked up awards for years. The controls, player movements, atmosphere, soundtrack, and online are all exceptional, and has created a phenomenon. There can be no doubt that EA has made one of the best franchises in sports video games. So how does the Playstation Vita version of FIFA 12 hold up to its console counterparts? Exceptionally.The breakdown: The gameplay of FIFA is its heart and soul, and carrying that over to a handheld is a heavy order. However, the higher specs of the Vita have allowed for console engines to run on it, making FIFA nearly an exact replica of the Playstation 3 or Xbox 360 version. Controls are the same, but that's not the most important area of the game. The most important area of the game is the atmosphere. On the pitch, everything is different, and that's what FIFA captures so excellently on consoles. On Vita the atmosphere transfers without a hitch. The commentary is relayed the same as well, and the crowd contributes to every match nearly as well as it would in real life.Graphically FIFA is golden. Night games aren't played in total darkness, and day games come across as a beautiful sunny afternoon. Even on the smaller screen players are easy to identify and target. Player faces are done well, and colors stand out wonderfully on the OLED of the Vita.Some game modes are missing from the console version, of course, and worst of all is the lack of crossplay between the Playstation 3 version and Vita version. A type of crossplay similar to that of The Show's crossplay, where one can transfer a dynasty over and play on the go, would have been a great addition to the game. Online functions much the same as it does regularly, and the Vita handles online play like a pro.The touch uses for the game vary from quite ingenious to overly cumbersome. The use of the rear touch pad for shooting is the best use of touch features that I've ever seen, but the touch passing and lobs simply get in the way of regular gameplay (one can also switch players by touching the screen). It's great that the game doesn't force these extra uses on the player; they can be turned off (I play with them off), as some players may find that the touch elements of the game correspond well with their type of play.Overall: FIFA 12 on Vita is a great example of how console games can be ported successfully to the Vita, and sets the bar high for future EA sports games on the system. It's nearly a replication of the game given to players on the PS3 or 360, but all set in the palm of your hand. It's not worth it even trying to find something wrong with this game, and if one did attempt a search, it's hard to imagine that it wouldn't be futile.",5,Console Quality on a Handheld,1339286400,"06 10, 2012"

They get kidnapped by some violent locals and held for ransom.  Justin Bieber somehow escapes, though his brother is killed during the escape.  You now play as Justin Bieber, who is tasked with rescuing his remaining friends and getting revenge for his dead brother.  Justin Bieber's complete lack of combat and survival training is conveniently explained by some mystical island mojo.  In less than a day's time, you are transformed from useless rich kid to the equivalent of a member of Seal Team Six.This is actually a not-so-inaccurate summary of the opening sequence of the game.

I played for a while, constantly training and playing with my own virtual pup! ^-^ But, unforutanelty, my constant playing was Nintendogs' eventual downfall. It suffered from EPS, Ecessive Playing Syndrome. Basically, you play it 'till it's sucked dry, and there's nothing left to do.At this point, I'll point out the Pros, Cons, and the In-Between Things that Aren't Really a Pro or Con.Pros: *Lovely Graphics, it makes the game look realistic.*A large assortment of toys to be found!*Bark mode: let your dog interact with other player's dogs. For me, it's a bit pointless, since I don't even use it, but oh well.* Do realistic things like Feed, groom, and play with your puppies!Cons: *Not enough breeds. And, the ones you do have, really aren't all that great. (Except for the Labrador ^-^)*NOT ENOUGH TO DO!!! This is the last, and pretty much worst of all the cons. Although there is only two cons and four pros, the cons outweigh the Pros by a longshot. Graphics won't make up for the fact that the gameplay is not substantial. Sure, it's fun adopting a pup for the first time, and training them, but let's face it. After a week, it gets repetitive. The only way to 'play' with your virtual pup is to pet it, or throw a stick, ball, etc at it. And when you take your dog on a 'walk' it's really pretty boring, and It's only a way to get more balls. Contests are sort of fun, but there are only three different types, and you can only enter each one three times a day. -_-; Plus, you can only have three dogs with you at a time. The others have to be stored at a hotel.In-Between Things: Dogs don't grow up. Not exactly a con, but not a pro either. Nor is it realistic. It's sort of endearing to watch a dog grow up. Now, the dog could grow up, but, it wouldn't have to die either. (This is the way it is in the Petz games, for the computer. They grow up, but never die. plus, they can breed and have kittenz, or puppiez. yes, in the Petz games, there are Catz.)Overall, this game is about a C-. Good graphics, boring gameplay. This is a game to rent, not buy. Overall, I'd suggest you buy the Petz games instead. A LOT more to do in those games. Until next time!

I never thought that pushing buttons that pop up on the screen could be so fun but it is. There are some problems in the controls though. The walking in the game sometimes gets inverted when the camera changes. It's nothing too bothersome, but it is annoying. The facial animations are some of the best I've ever seen in a game. The emotion in this game is amazing. It really helps you connect to these characters and feel their pain. Some of the environments could have been done better though. The objects in the game are not well done, almost ps2 quality. Thankfully the characters are very well done so it distracts you from the low res objects that appear around them. The story has a lot of twists and turns that changes based on the choices you make. There are multiple endings and it really helps the replay value, as you try to achieve them all.

This is practically the poster child for what is wrong with a lot of the games today.  With the coming of xbox, ps3 and wii we have a generation of gamers clamoring for high end graphics, holywood style cinematics, and mind-numbing ease of playability. This in itself is not bad, but the current gen systems demand much higher development costs and when ratings are earned more on superficialities where do you think they are funneling their assets? Ultimately this paints a very ugly picture for the future of gaming. Games like these are basically killing innovation and originality in the industry and the only people we have to blame are ourselves because we are the ones feeding the monster.OK enough complaining.. here is my honest opinion:Graphics:  Good - some screen tearing. This is a pet peeve of mine but I know some people don't care.Sound: GoodCinematics: GoodFlow of play and pacing: GoodStory: Below average. Generic plotlines.Characters: Lame - Annoying at bestAction - average at best - point and shoot 3rd person action. useless melee attacks. Some vehicle driving thrown in for variety.Puzzles & platforming - some are ok, but mostly very easy. Platforming is fluid, but very easy. Good for little kids who have not developed enough dexterity to play more challenging games.Replayability: very little, there are some treasures you can find throughout, but they don't do anything so chances are you will stop caring about them almost right away. There are plenty of other easy 3rd person action games for you to enjoy.Overall: A mindless romp for the masses, but the developer hit the nail on the head and achieved exactly what they were going for. It will entertain you for like 2-3 play sessions maybe. If you have the attention span of a chipmunk you might find more to like here. If you have the attention span of a slightly smarter animal you may have a rough time. Bottom line: Shame on you for over-hyping this pile and shame on me for buying it.

But I've become so used to ""switching on"" my aircraft that I just had to have another to replace it.So after heavy testing of the old one to be sure it was dead, I ordered another one..After attaching the new one, I decided to see if the old one was totally shot, or if some part of it could still be salvaged.When I plugged the old one back in, it worked! BOTH old & new were recognized immediately.I spent less than 5 seconds thinking about returning it, but decided to keep it for the extra switches..SAITEK PROVIDES NO WAY TO REPOURPOSE (essentially - re-program) THEIR PANELS!However, it can be done with SPAD and FSUIPC..I'm still in the process of re-assigning the switches. Once I've decided what I want them to do, I'll print an overlay with the new names.The first two changes was to re-assign the OFF/R/L/BOTH-All rotary switch to control to the fuel selection.The old ""GEAR UP"" lever is now ""Locked Breaks"" (down), and ""Unlocked Breaks"" (up).That gives me a visual indicator of the parking break status, as well as a satisfying audio/tactile sensation when locking or releasing them. It beats the heck out of using a mouse to do the job.As far as I'm concerned, this is a better solution than buying aX-keys USB 16 Key Stick for Windows or Macfor $105.===================================================================================================UPDATE 1/28/12Using the free program SPAD and FSUIPC (paywear) I was able to make the Switch panel behave much more realistically. No one else makes such, relatively, low cost sim aviation hardware. But Saitek just seems to call it a day and go home after ***barely*** getting the drivers written.Specifically;- Before, when you turn the left hand knob to ""OFF"" nothing would happen. It now shuts down the engines.- The same goes for the fuel pump. NOW.- In fact, my engines can't start if the settings aren't correct.- The ""Gear Down/UP"" lever just sent the key ""G"" to FSX, and FSX didn't ALWAYS remember what position the gears were in. So the lever could, physically, be in the down position upon FSX startup but FSX, internally, listed it in ""gear up"" position.  Now it ALWAYS start in whatever position the physical gear lever is in.What I once thought of as an interesting, but largely unneeded device, I now use on every flight.PS - Don't tell Saitek but I think that it's worth a lot more, when set up properly, than what they sell it for.===================================================================================================At the regular price I have my doubts about it's worth. ESPECIALLY using the Saitek drivers/software.So the first thing that you have to know is DON'T use the Saitek drivers/software! DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!DON'TThe program you want is called SPAD (free software). SPAD stands for Saitek Panels Advanced Driver. It's so much better that if it didn't exist I would strongly recommend that no one buys the Switch Panel. If you did install even the newest Saitek drivers you'll have to remove them.About the Saitek PRO Flight Switch Panel (using the Saitek driver/software);1) Turning the knob on the left does nothing. Out of the box it wouldn't start up any of the planes that I tried (I only tried a couple).2) The switches have little effect on the aircraft that I tried it on. Only the light switches did anything noticeable. Turn off the fuel pump, avionics, & master switches while flying. No problem, everything keeps on flying. The same goes for the rotary switch on the left. Set it to OFF while flying and the plane keeps right on flying (on a couple of multi-engine planes one out of 2, or one out of 4 would shut down). (With SPAD & FSUIP *ALL* engines die when I switch it off.)3) The landing gear, with accompanying status lights, IS GREAT! But that alone doesn't make the Switch Panel worth buying if you use the Saitek drivers/software.So why buy it?The Saitek PRO Flight Switch Panel *** with the right software *** can do a lot to make flying on a sim much more enjoyable.1) SPAD can join the 3 main Saitek panel into a cohesive whole. If you have the Pro Flight Radio Panel and this one you can make the ""START"" setting start 4 engines ENDIVIDUALY, and in whatever order you want. You use the top left hand Com/Nav switches to select the engine to start and then turn the switch from ""BOTH/ALL"" to START (and then back, of course). I have the CH Products Eclipse Yoke. On the right side (front) are 2 switches. Left switch up to select engine #1. Down to select engine #2. Right Switch up to select engine #3. Down to select engine #4.2) Using SPAD and FSUIP (payware) you CAN program the switches. Basically you open FSUIP (in the Add-ons tab) and SPAD. You then select the switch you want to modify (from within SPAD) on the Switch Panel and send a virtual joystick key to FSUIP. You can choose up to 32 virtual joystick keys thru SPAD.Starting up a plane from a cold cockpit is a lot more fun than just taking off and landing, it's a blast! And THAT is why I recommend the Switch Panel.The only caveat to the whole thing is in the way that the flight sims are set up. There is no logic tree to flight sims regarding how you can, and have to, use them. A keyboard is the basic starting place and everything else after that is just an add-on to the keyboard. So even with the plane powered down you can still hit a key on the keyboard and start all the motors at once. Or you can do it right and flip those switches.So far my flight sim gear is;1)CH PRODUCTS Eclipse Yoke Discover Bundle (200616DIS)The trim wheels on the yoke makes life so much better. The rudder ""paddles"" aren't used that much, but when you need them, there they are. The 3 levers on the top right are now set to Cowling (cowling aren't just opened OR closed), Flaps, and Spoilers.2)TrackIr 5 Professional Premium Head Tracking for GamingOnce you get used to this, you can't live without it.

Pretty much a remake of Goodfellas, same director, a lot of the same actors, but inferior.  Decent movie, but definitely not great.  Those two movies describe how I feel about Vice City. While GTA3 was probably the greatest game ever created, this game is merely playable.The good news about Vice City is that it's not Grand Theft Auto 4 - it's best to consider it a sort of expansion pack to Grand Theft Auto 3.  This means it pretty much uses the exact same engine as GTA3 that we all know and love.  I could go on and on about how great this free roaming city is, but then I'd just be re-reviewing GTA3.What people won't tell you is the bad.  Here it is.  First off, this game is full of bugs.  Some of them minor, some of them full on PC like crashes.  Didn't we all buy a console to get away from PC faults?  I've worked on games before, and I know for a fact that if Sony's team finds a crash, it automatically gets rejected and has to wait for another cycle.  Since the game crashed 4 times for me, I have a feeling Sony let these mishaps slide.  It's a shame, because Sony usually hasn't wavered at all.  They've actually prevented Sony's own games from being shipped, losing tons of marketing dollars due to mistimed advertising.Secondly, the game is way, way too gimmicky.  The amount of time spent on the missions were split between with 20% car based kill em or chase em missions, and the 80% on other types of missions.  The mission numbers themselves are not split up that way, but you spend more time and are much more annoyed on the gimmicky missions.  The gimmicky missions are the ones that involve a radio controlled helicopter, motorcycles, bi-planes, boats, going into malls, racing, and any mission involving another character named Lance.  The rc helicopter motorcycles, planes, and boats are just clumsy, annoying, unresponsive, and not fun at all.  Since each new vehicle requires a learning curve, I spent even more time being bored and frustrated with these vehicles.  Lance is the worst.  He's with you in some missions, but does the stupidest things, likes stands in front of you gun fire, or while you're hiding behind a wall from gunfire, he'll follow you and stop right before the wall, just standing there like a sitting duck waiting to be shot.  The races are hard, and since there is no freedom, all it is just a cheap racing game - those are a dime a dozen these days.  In fact, the four or five hardest missions were hampered by the cheapness of Lance, the utter horror of using the lame other vehicles, bugs and crashes, and/or the race problems.Thirdly, are that the missions themselves are not apparent.  In GTA3, I used a walkthrough for the missions.  I vowed not to use it for this game.  Unfortunately, I had to use a walkthrough to find the missions themselves!  Here's the thing that you are suppose to magically guess.  After completing one mission, you can buy properties.  Out of the many properties, there are about 8 assets to get.  They won't tell you which ones, so you have to buy them all up or guess.  So, each asset has missions.  Of course some of these assets won't even tell you the mission.  One is where you have to sell 50 items, but there is no mention of 50 items.  I suppose I was suppose to have guessed that as well.  Another is just plain stupid.  You buy a strip club, and the ""mission"" is to go to dance booth and stay there for fifteen minutes.  But no one bothers saying that that is a mission.  I would have never found that out on my own; I would not have even tried that as a guess, because I'm not desperate enough to look at a polygon stripper for fifteen minutes.So, in order to get to the last missions - you would to have guessed the following: buy 6 assets, including the print works and Malibu club, complete all the missions, including the ones where the mission itself is not presented, and then, you can go to the last missions.  Am I freakin' Miss Cleo here?  What the heck is up with that?  I'm here to play a game, not some King's Quest point, click, look, early nineties game.  If I wanted to wander around like a dumbass, I would have bought Silent Hill 2.Another thing is that Vice City is much smaller than Liberty City, and not as fun.  Liberty City had potholes, hills, tunnels, tons of overpasses, Chinatown, a red light district, posh neighborhoods, Mafia controlled areas, six rival gangs, and was basically huge and diverse.  This didn't seem to have that.Lastly, is Rockstar's emphasis on style over substance.  They added eighties music.  Isn't that why societies evolve and progress, in order to avoid the mistakes of past generations?  Why the heck do they want to bring back the most boring decade of them all.  A decade so boring, it's the only one Austin Powers hasn't even gone to.  Why?  Also, they decided to add more full motion video.  That's fine, but they repeatedly placed them in the middle of missions, and sometimes you can't skip over them.  While attempting some of the more badly designed missions, I'm forced to watch the same full motion video over and over again.There are some slight improvements.  Each asset and property has a save point.  Going to a golf course and riding golf carts is really fun.  Also, the auto aiming is much, much easier and a real time saver.Pros:Still free rangingStill one of the better games aroundExpansion of GTA3Cons:FMVs - more style than substanceGimmicky missionsSmallerHarder finding the missions than the missions themselvesBoats, rc helicopters, bikes need to go.BugsBad AI, especially with LanceDifficulty: MediumHours to play: 30Frustration Level: High",3,&#65533;Casino&#65533; to GTA 3&#65533;s &#65533;Goodfellas,1038355200,"11 27, 2002"

374,143279,A2RTDNFAVUWTAN,B002I0KOLA,Christopher Allen,"[19, 38]","When I tried to install Medieval, I got this cyclic redundancy check error and a lot of other people are getting it too. I contacted EA's customer service and was told to create a new folder on my desktop and then copy over everything from the disk to that folder, yadda, yadda, yadda. That didn't work so I searched the internet and found a player's site that had information on this error. It turns out that I can enter my game code into to the EA download manager and then download a digital copy of the game. I did this and it worked wonderfully. I had a perfectly clean install, updated the game and played for hours with no glitches or crashes.  I really like the game too. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I do because I have always enjoyed building in the sims games more than anything but so far, this is a lot of fun even though I can't build. I think I needed a break from the sims series and this seems like it will be a good change.One thing I do like about this game is that while it isn't like the sims games, it still has the feel of a sims game. It's hard to describe unless you play it but they really did stay true to the whole sims style here. I have said for a long time that it would be fun if there would be an expansion where sims could travel through time. Well, this is no expansion and is VERY different from The Sims 3 but it does feel like how the sims may have been in medieval times. The tutorial was VERY helpful but wow was it long. I wished it was a little shorter but at least I know what I need to do in this game now.I am afraid that the quests can become repetitive and boring but so far I feel like they did a good job of making them varied enough to where it's not bad. If you played the World Adventures expansion for The Sims 3, the quests are a little more involved than the ones in that EP but are similar. You do get guidance on what you need to do so you aren't just trying to figure out your next step but at times it seems like a little too much guidance. The quests are easy but take a while to do. They may get harder to figure out as you advance but I don't know since I haven't played that long yet. I really like this game and I love the look of it too. The kingdom is beautiful! ( I named mine Hassenthorpe) The sims look incredible. It took a little bit of adjusting to CAS because it's not exactly like the sims 3 but it is very close so it's not too hard to adjust to it. But I was amazed when I first saw CAS because the sims do look more realistic and the medieval style clothing has been wonderfully created. This game feels a lot more thought out, polished and complete than The Sims 3 base game did when it first came out.EDIT Again: So after you finish the first goal of setting up your kingdom, you start over with another NEW kingdom and create another NEW monarch and then start doing the SAME quests again but this time you have to annex surrounding territories instead of focusing on adding new buildings to your kingdom. Now why would I want to keep going throught the same quests? I'm assuming that after this goal, I will have to create yet another new kingdom and new monarch and then start doing all the same quests yet again for whatever goal I have to reach that time. This is absolutely ridiculous and I am now done with this game. It's too freaking boring doing the same thing over and over. And it's annoying having to start over with a new kingdom. So I pretty much paid $50 for a game that I got completely bored with in a few days. Oh so I guess I will be ridiculed unless I put this in my post: I did dedicate all of my gameplay to this but I spent a total of maybe 14 hours with it until I became totally bored.",1,I'm changing my review . . .,1300752000,"03 22, 2011"

This controller looks ALOT like a PS2 controller.  But do not be fooled, it does not play ANYTHING like a real PS2 controller.  I've played many third party controllers over my time, I've played some really terrible ones over the years.  This is THE WORST controller I've ever played.  I bought this for the main reasons most people would buy this, its a wireless PS2 controller and it looks just like the real PS2 controller.  Thats the only good things about this controller.  Its built horribly cheap, it feels like it weighs almost nothing.  It makes the real PS2 controller seem heavy.  It takes a while to actually get the thing to work, at first I thought it was sync problem, but actually appears that the On/Off circut board which is very cheaply popping out the botton of the controller, is simply poorly made, I had to keep turning it on and off before it finally recognized.  The battery setup is not any better, the batteries barely fit, it was a very cheap mold they used to let you put the batteries in.  Finally, once you get past the mess of getting it started up, then you have to deal with the buttons not working or being very unresponsive.  Every button, trigger, bumper, stick is bad on this thing.  The D-Pad and front face buttons are probably the worst.  My start button on this controller would stick alot.

No real choices at all, no exploration, no real mini-games worth playing, and yes - it is truly just running down the hall and fighting the next boss.In my opinion FF-X was vastly superior.  The game of Blitzball (love it or hate it) was a huge draw for me.  Blitzball was perfectly engineered - but they ruined Blitzball in FF-X2 by taking away player control.  The rest of the games in the FF series were all quite better than this one.Pros:1)  Being able to switch roles in-battle is great.  The talent trees are well done and the 2 players that you don't control do a fairly good job at doing their part.2)  It is pretty, even though I felt like 90% of it was just running down a small hallway.3)  If you get killed, you can retry the battle and don't have to reload from a save point.Cons:1)  Ugh - so much story, so little to explore.  This was truly like reading a book and just participating in the fights.2)  It gets so tiresome hearing them repeat the whole game - ""we can do it, no we can't"".  Okay for the first 5 hours, but this is all they can talk about the whole game?  It really gets boring.3)  Equipment upgrades?a)  If you upgrade your equipment, the new weapons and items you find a worthless compared to the upgraded original equipment.  Finding new weapons and accesories is pretty much pointless.b)  Your supposed to be able to ""evolve"" your equipment, but this only happened once in the game for me!  You have to upgrade a weapon up 25 levels to evolve?  Wow - insane AND very expensive in-game.4)  I can only assume that the battle between L'Cie and Fal'Cie had far more meaning to players outside the United States.  The whole story line seemed pretty boring to me and if it accomplished anything - it was the ability to simply confuse the player.5)  The creatures you summon in this game are truly worthless.Overall - this was one of the least impressive FF games I have ever played.  It was possibly the worst one.  Like I said, it's like reading a book or watching a movie and just getting to perform the fights to get further down a hallway.

As a veteran RE fan here're my personal thoughts:+ Graphics - nice use of light effects+ Offline co-op play through the story mode - a huge plus for my gf and I as we each spent countless hours replaying RE 4 separately and we were always dreaming of playing co-op together.+ Difficulty - enemies are smarter and a little bit more unpredictable than RE4.  Also added more enemies that are capable of ranged attacks (i.e. machine guns).  They also do a good job at trapping/surrounding you and sneaking into your blind spots.- Details to face - this is especially true for the main characters.  Chris looks great from the side but awfully ugly face-to-face.  Something's wrong with how his eyes were drawn in proportion to his face.  Sheva has great body figure but lacks facial details and expression.- Originality - I tend to agree with the voice that calls this merely a HD version of RE4.  The overall setup, scenes, and enemy formation are not much different from its predecessor.- Inventory & weapon system - Hate the inventory.  To cope with the real-time inventory system introduced in RE 5, each item now takes up one of the 9 inventory blocks regardless of its relative size.  This seems like a step back and in fact I never seem to be able to find the right balance anymore between how many different arms I want to carry versus extra rounds or cures.  Although different models of each type of firearm is now available, they fail to distinguish the guns from each other by assigning ""exclusive upgrades"" like they did in RE4.  What's the point of having three diff shot guns, with one having slightly more fire power, one with slightly higher capacity for more rounds, and another one with a slightly wider attack range?- Cut-scene actions:  I hate it when they force you to punch one button rapidly.  It doesn't challenge a veteran gamer like myself, but I have many casual gaming friends who can't pass certain stages just because they can't needle the buttons like a machine gun.  My gf and I co-played all the way til the very last chap and find ourselves stuck because both characters have their moments of button punching while the other needs to cover with rifles.  She can't punch fast enough so her char always dies.  I mean, you need to punch extremely fast and rapid.

However, it cannot compare to the full body experience with Kinect!Currently I am planning on getting UFC Personal Trainer, Dance Central 2 as well as Kinect Sports S2!

9976,54410,A3EK57ZHMA55G5,B0007WZLG4,Lestor neeker Wong,"[39, 40]","If you've played a tycoon simulation before, you'll find Tycoon City: New York vaguely familiar. You know, you're the boss, and you'll be fully responsible for how your business grows. In Tycoon City: New York, the business is to build an empire in the city of New York. And to a certain extent, it provides quite an entertaining experience of doing so, even though the effect isn't quite as lasting as it could've been.Before you begin, you'll be asked to choose a mode of play. Seasoned tycoon gamers, or those who simply want a more open-ended quest, can choose the ""Sandbox"" mode, which basically gives you the entire island of Manhattan, and the freedom to do almost everything with it. Almost, because some of the famous landmarks can only be built if you manage to achieve certain status. The Sandbox also allow you to turn off competition completely, but that's hardly what you want to play a game for, is it?The ""Build New York"" mode is more structured, since it's actually the main campaign mode of the game. This offers tutorials on the various aspects of the game as you progress, as well as some missions along the way to keep the interest going. Missions come in the form of ""opportunities"", and fulfilling them will help improve your standing as a tycoon. An opportunity, for example, could be the influx of students into your district. To satisfy these students, you'll need to build street fashion retail shops, internet cafes, burger joints, and so on. Doing so will rake in the profits, which will in turn allow you to build more businesses. To fully complete an opportunity mission, however, you'd still need to achieve the objectives given by the game, which usually require you to hit a certain percentage of certain ratings. These are not difficult to achieve, but some level of multi-tasking is required to truly excel.The rewards of completing a mission could be new items in your Build menu, or even Landmark Points, which you can use to build prominent landmarks. At the time of writing, I've built the Greenwich Church and the Greenwich Courthouse Library, which is not too bad for a few hours of play, I guess. Having landmarks in a district greatly increases its rating, and soon after you build them, you'll find yourself unlocking new districts where you can further strengthen your empire.The strength of your empire is measured by your total earnings. It's therefore important to identify the needs of the people in the districts, and build businesses to satisfy them. Each business has a sphere of influence, which basically shows you how far its reaches in terms of fulfilling needs. You can also upgrade a business by improving its appeal and satisfaction level, but you'd need to accumulate upgrade credits to do so. Each business also has a fixed amount of upgrade limits, so you'd need to juggle between your resources, as well as each business' limitations. This could turn out to be quite a challenge. Also, if you fancy a competitor's business, you can always buy it over. It's usually expensive to do so, but the takeover could still proved to be fruitful if it's raking in profits by the truckload daily.Tycoon City: New York is primarily focused on business, rather than infrastructural expansions. Sure, you create buildings all the time, but they only take a few seconds to be completed, letting you go straight into enhancing the businesses right away. Unfortunately, the game gives very little control over your finances. Apart from earning profits, and the odd sale of existing businesses, you won't get much opportunities to further your earnings. The game would have appeal better if it allows some level of business micromanagement. For example, after adding an advertising billboard to increase an appeal of a building, it'd be more fun if you can actually sell the advertising space for cash. Nonethelss, this is not a major issue.The main issue for Tycoon City: New York is the limited gameplay. You'll find yourself clicking on empty plots of land, and creating new businesses. And that's basically it. Even with opportunities and expansions, what you'll effectively do over the course of the game is to click on empty plots of land, and create new businesses. This is exactly why the game gets old very quickly, even though it has the potential to be highly addictive.Presentation wise, Tycoon City: New York is definitely a looker. The infrastructural models look solid, with great details on each type of building. A sense of appropriateness also comes into play for the upgrades, since you can add display items for your shops so that they look better. So, a restaurant may have an additional seating area outside the shop, a retail shop may have a bargain bin, and a night club may have a bouncer. All these add to the variety of graphics, and you can't help but stop and admire at these additional details from time to time.The audio presentation is a little weak by comparison. The music is rather boring, and the voice-overs (yes, you do get to see people talking) are bland. But at least Deep Red included a nice little identification jingle for each type of building. This is seldom seen in games of this genre, and is quite a pleasant touch to accommodate the slow gameplay.Overall, Tycoon City: New York is an enjoyable game. It's straight to the point, it's visually beautiful, and to a certain extent, it may even have mass appeal - who doesn't like making money? What drags it down is its overly mundane gameplay, and the lack of a real challenge. If you're simply looking to enjoy a tycoon game without ever risking the chance of losing the game, Tycoon City: New York should just do the trick.",3,Money doesn't grow on trees,1141862400,"03 9, 2006"

A few years later I was looking for a new game to play and I saw this on the shelf at Best Buy. It was only 20 bucks so I decided to give it a go. I didn't remember how to play really and I was shocked at how quickly you get thrown into the thick of the game. I don't really like fighting eagle-eyed mercs from 1000 yards away with a pistol when they have armor and assault rifles. I didn't much care for the voice acting in the game and I felt the main character was extremely cliche'. One issue that really bugged me was the way that talking competed with the game. It seemed like every time Doyle would talk to me I would be in the middle of a firefight or I wouldn't be able to hear a word he said without stopping what I was doing and turning up the volume. The story was rather mediocre and the idea of genetically altered something or others is so overdone. My biggest peeve about this game is the lack of save points. I felt like I could play Far Cry for an hour without finding a save point. Maybe it is just me, but I hate getting through a difficult part only to get killed by something stupid and having to redo that entire difficult part. There were some parts of the game where I would have to stop playing for a few days and gather my nerves after trying to the same part for hours straight.On the plus side, it has very good graphics and physics are good. The vehicles are fun to use as well. The weapon selection is pretty good too.I wouldn't pay much more for this game than $20. Also, don't play on the hardest setting like I did.

I had to rely on a walkthrough just to get through a Nancy Drew game (I'm NOT a youngster, by the way).So, when I say I was able to play the entire game with almost no 'hints' you get an idea of how relatively easy it is. That's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, I preferred it over the completely illogical and complex Myst-type puzzles.The story was a bit hokey (and that's being kind) and I don't understand why they had to ""hunk"" up George. If I'm not mistaken, in the first Broken Sword game he was a bit of a bumbling nerd -- but charming and at least not an Indiana Jones clone. And does every female character in these games have to look like Lara Croft, with the obligatory short shorts???? Let's try something different once in a while!Still, that didn't detract too much from the fun of the game. Oddly enough, once I got used to the controls, I didn't have any trouble moving the characters around and I thought the graphics were very well done for the most part.I did have a few other 'pet peeves' I need to get off my chest,  such as:a) Nico's constantly stretching and flicking link off her shoulder -- these gestures were annoying and distracting. Was the stretching some adolescent male programmer's idea of sexy, perhaps?b) no way to bypass certain cut scenes so if you did ""die"" you had to sit through them again (and again and again).c) when both Nico and George appeared together, the graphics were terrible. She kept disappearing and reappearing, flicking around the screen, etc. Not a glitch, exactly, just poorly done.d) too many dumb ""move the boxes"" puzzles. For once, I was good at something and by the time the end game came I though if I had to shove one more box around the screen, I'll kill George and Nico myself and align myself with Sussaro (the bad guy).Okay, lots of pet peeves and complaints ... but I still give the game a 4 since, compared to so many other adventure games, it had enough good moments -- at a good price -- to put it ahead of the pack.",4,Good ... not great,1113350400,"04 13, 2005"

In fact, the game plays a lot like one on one extreme dodgeball. The action is fast and frantic. There are two opponents on seperate sides divided by a line. If you cross the line, you lose life every 3 seconds or something like that. You pick up power ups that can be used to conjure up monsters or to cast spells. The more powerups you have the more stuff you can throw at the other guy. So basically you pick up white balls off the ground and then you use their power to send monsters to hit the other guy. Unlike dodgeball, though, you could even run over to the other side to steal your opponents power ups, or better yet, join your little monsters in the beatings. I guess it's more like streetfighter/dodgeball. The game is action packed, and it's somewhat entertaining, especially when playing with friends.

You can jump higher and fall slower as Luigi, Mario has average speed and jump height, Peach can float in mid air but not run as fast, Toad runs really fast but cannot jump as high.Powerups are a real important part of any of the Super Mario games and this one has loads that you can use to your advantage. But there are new powerups such as a cat costume (that has it&#8217;s own attacks and allows you to climb walls), double cherries (that allow you to create a clone of yourself) and Goomba masks that allows you to blend in and not be attacked by enemy Goombas.Also one player can use the Gamepad to not only touch the screen to hinder enemies and aid players but to reveal hidden blocks and items.

Additionally, the other fitness selections also were limited in their variety and difficulty.Wii Fit Plus is a great way to take your Wii Fit program to the next level. Nintento has obviously looked at the popularity and flexibility of some other Wii fitness programs likeMy Fitness Coach. My Fitness Coach is a much more extensive workout program than Wii Fit Plus but does not offer the fun balance games that Wii Fit offers.A great plus is that Wii Fit Plus transfers over your data from your original Wii Fit workouts.They both have their positive aspects and it is nice to have both in my Wii arsenal of programs.I love the new addition to the 'fun' games. There is an additional table tilt, a snowball fight, a flying bird 'bullseye' game, Rhythm Parade and Segway Circuit and others that have all added more fun to the experience. There are also additional yoga and aerobic exercises.Wii Fit Plus adds a lot of variety and flexibility to its program now. You can customize your own program or follow some short sets that Wii Fit Plus already has programed. Everything has the ability to be customized, reordered, remixed, etc.The biggest thing to keep in mind with the Wii Fit (either original or Plus) is that there are limitations. There are exercises that would normally be done with a wider stance but because you need to keep your feet on the balance board, it is a little unnatural. There is limited actual exercise benefit although after 30 minutes, one can work up a small sweat. For those who do not usually exercise at all, it is at least something to keep moving and work on balance and strength. For those looking for an intense workout, this is not going to be it.What I am most pleased about is that Wii Fit Plus is available for a very reasonable price if you already have Wii Fit and the balance board. They could have pushed the price up knowing that we were a captive audience but this price point is fair and reasonable.I would recommend this as an upgrade to Wii Fit.",5,A 'Step' Up to the Original Wii Fit,1264636800,"01 28, 2010"

That's not happening like in other RPGs unless you put in way too much grinding for your own health.This game you need to plan and craft your team around the enemies you encounter at every major area of the game, because deflecting and negating attacks removes some of the enemy team's actions in a turn, and landing 'super effective' attacks adds more actions to yours (the reverse is also true, making it really important to learn what everyone is good and bad against as far as elements go, the game won't tell you with one of the apps until you've defeated an enemy a few times first.)TL;DR?

You put it in, it's still the same game (Madden), with some tweaks, and you can get right into it.  Pretty smooth gameplay without requiring a PhD to play.  They've added something called Madden IQ, so it constantly tracks how you're doing, making even Madden a competitive pressure-cooker for the truly obsessed who curse themselves for dumb plays, turnovers, and sloppy execution.  Actually, this feature is supposed to adjust the difficulty to your level on multiple fronts (pass offense, run defense, etc).  Or you can play the old levels.It's all here.  And who am I kidding?  I just got the thing, I've not played every feature.  It doesn't matter.  You're either gonna get Madden, or you won't.

7931,13076,A57Q87B0TC9IJ,B00004UE0O,Derek G,"[9, 10]","I'm compelled to write a review about this game because it is groundbreaking in the fact that the gameplay *is* unlike any other game.  If you find yourself bored by the same crop of first person shooters or command and conquer clones, you may want to pick up a copy just to try something new and different (but read on first to be sure...)Considering EA owns the rights to the Sim-City franchise, this game could have been accurately billed as &quot;Sim-God.&quot;  I think Amazon and the other reviewers have done a good job of describing the gameplay so I'll try not to be redundant.First off, when you first load the game - be prepared to spend a full evening playing around with it.  The game starts off with a very well done introduction and teaches you how to move around,  control the creature, cast spells, etc...  You'll find yourself drawn in very quickly as you want to see what happens next and that is where the problems start.You see, when you first start out it's rather unclear what it is you ARE supposed to do in this game.  Being weaned on many years of resource management games and trying to be a nice God, I spent a long time trying to keep my villagers happy, (&quot;we need houses, we need food&quot; yada yada yada), but they would never shut up! It's enough to make me go nuts and destroy everyone - which kind of makes me wonder if that's what God thinks of all of us but that's a different discussion.  In any case, it took me a while to figure out they won't shut up regardless and I just need to progress with whatever I'm doing and ignore them.  (That's a tip for all you new players.)So what is it you are supposed to do?  Basically use your influence to take over villages which allow you to increase in power so you can take over more villages.  At its heart it really is a resource management game much like Command and Conquer.  Instead of building up a bunch of tanks and army men to take over the next town you cast spells and use your creature -in good ways or bad - to &quot;wow&quot; neighboring villages into worshipping you.  If you don't, you're stuck in this constant state of inertia trying to please your villagers who are never satisfied with anything you do.  This is quite the opposite of the &quot;do anything you want&quot; sales pitch EA's marketing department puts in their ads.Another myth is the concept of your creature having free will and the ability to learn.  This is far from the truth.  Basically the creature will do something and you either reinforce the behavior positively (petting) or negatively (slapping).  Based on what you do the creature is &quot;supposed&quot; to do that same action more often or less often.  At the risk of this entire review not making it past the censors at Amazon, I'll give you an example.  You see, I picked the tiger creature - not the brightest but supposedly a good fighter.  Well apparently it has decided it likes to poop on houses.  It's kind of funny to watch, but the villagers understandably don't like this very much.  I've been slapping the poop out of him (pun intended) but he won't stop.  So much for the ability to learn.  Instead I'm supposed to try to get him to poop in the fields as it'll help the crops grow.  Well what am I supposed to do?  If I place the poop in the fields it just stands there.  If I hand poop to him, he'll just look at me funny or worse yet, try and eat it.  I guess I'm the one that needs to be praying he poops in the fields so I can quickly pet him and reinforce the behavior.  As far as the things the creature has done right, positive reinforcement doesn't really seem to make him continue to do the same action.  I've found the whole concept of trying to &quot;teach&quot; my creature very frustrating and it's been more of an annoyance than an asset to the game.And fighting?  It's kind of like playing Rock-em Sock-em Robots.  There's no control.  Instead you just mash a lot of buttons and (again) pray you end up the winner.  When winning a fight against another creature becomes a necessity in the game (and I know it will eventually), my inability to do so will probably be the point I put down the game and never play it again.The review is harsh so far I know, but you see, in spite of these problems I still find myself drawn to this game.  In fact, just writing this review has made me want to load it up again.  The graphics and music really are top-notch and I haven't run into any bugs or system crashes (a rarety in the gaming world these days.)  I'm usually the type that will give a game one or two days at the max before giving up on it.  Even games I do like rarely hold my interest to the end.  This game is a rare exception.  I keep thinking, maybe if I do something differently...Reread the Amazon and DailyRadar reviews or jump over to the PCGamer site and read all the praise they've heaped on this game.

Warhawk is likely the worst PS3 game I've played to date.  To start with, there is absolutely no tutorial or any place to practice.  You are instantly tossed into chaos before you even know which button shoots.  The single solitary reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is flying.  The planes are fun to fly around in, that's it, nothing else worth a second look here.The games only purpose is combat, yet the combat is awful...simply awful.  I always hated war games where there is an advantage to jumping around.  Here comes warhawk.....you will immediately see people jumping through the air like a bunch of ballerinas fighting a war.  It just looks so stupid.  In real life do you think soldiers are jumping around on the battle field?  There is a crouch option which gives you no advantage at all.  So jumping is good, sneaking (crouching)is useless hmmmm....okThe absolute stupidest most irritating thing about this game is how the knives are the best freaking weapon to use...in a gunfight!!!  Wait until you get online and see how many people are running around with knives.  You can be shooting someone with a machine gun and they will run up to you and stab you.  You die faster from a stab wound in this game then from 40 rounds at close range with an assault rifle. There were hundreds of times where I am unloading my weapon into a guy and he's still running towards me to the point of me wondering if I'm even hitting him despite the crosshairs being directly on him. I'm serious, I even snuck up directly behind a guy and shot him in the head, did he drop dead?  No...he turned around and stabbed me, then I die.  OkBasically all the ""war"" consists of is a bunch of guys running around like chickens without heads and jumping through the air.  It reminds me of the lame online combat of Socom 1 for the PS2.  Dogfights in the air are clunky and depend on sheer luck.  Driving tanks is awkward and they explode far too easily.

Ive been postponing some ps3 classics that are newer and cheaper than these oldies, but so many good reviews and the fact that you get not one, but two games for less than 30$, I went on and bought GOW collection, with nothing but fate, and especting to be dissapointed.I was worried the old graphics would ruin the experience.I was worried the gameplay wasnt all that good.I was worried it would be too easy for me.I was worried it would be a linear game that I could finish by just pressing a single  attack button as fast as i could.After  hours into God of War (one), I can see I was worried for nothing.I can safely and convincinly say, This game could easily beat many good ""current"" games for the ps3. I can compare this to one of my other action games, ninja gaiden sigma, This game beats that game in almost any category.First of all, Theres nothing to worry about in terms of graphics. If I had bought GOW as a current 2009/2010 game, I would have said: Not great, but not bad either. Knowing that this is a game from the ps2, year 2005, I can see why many reviewrs gave it no less thatn 9.5/10. From this perspective, Ill give the graphics 10/10, for holding ground against current games while keeping its head held high.Second, Theres nothing to worry about in terms of difficulty. im playing normal, and I cant say its hard, but its hell fun. This game remains fun, while still being easy enough to let you advance fluently without making you repeat a level time after time till reaching a point of frustration. If you think its too hard or too easy, the game has different levels of difficulty.Third, gameplay. This is what makes it fun. GOW has it all. Combos that look awesome and have to have memorized, special powers, puzzles, minigames, or you can just slash your way through. As you advance, you can upgrade your powers and weapons making them stronger, and unlocking new combos. That gives you the chance to learn new combos untill you can upgrade and get new ones.Besides all this, the fact that Ive been having fun for five hours and that I know that Im probably not too close to finish the game, and that I have the sequel waiting for me right there in the same disk, makes me truly believe what i read before but didnt believe.

This is quite possibly the worst game I have played in quite some time, and definitely the ONLY one I have EVER played where the best boss strategy was--wait for it--standing directly in front of the boss and mashing the ""A"" button. I mashed my way through 5 hours of this game, people, and I even beat one of the bosses while eating a sandwich and not fully turning back toward the screen until I heard the myrrh tree music. Make no mistake, this is no incredible feat on my part: this game is really that stupid.In addition to the incredibly low level of challenge (god, was this game marketed for 10-year-olds? Then you shouldn't have put the FF title on it, Nintendo/SE!), I haven't seen a game this repetitive since Pacman. You heard me. It's as repetitive as an arcade game - only it was RELEASED IN 2004. This is truly a development that should put Square Enix to shame. All you do, per level, is wheel around in your crystal caravan, watching 10-second cutscenes at random, and fight your way through three levels (of your choice) til you fill your chalice with myrrh. W.O.W. Each level honestly takes fewer than 10 minutes, so you will probably complete a chapter in all of 30. What do you do for the next chapter, you ask? Does the plot advance? The answer is NO. You do the SAME DARN THING. AGAIN. After a few chapters pass, you even have the option of going back to the levels you have already visited. Gosh. What an EXCITING idea.The ONLY cool things about this game--and believe me, I really mean this part--are graphics, which are beautiful, and character customization, though that is of course minimal. But compared to the rest of the game, I don't know, I guess I'll take anything.Yet another complaint of mine is the rotating camera angle. For GOOD games, this isn't a problem, and your typical gamer would be hard put to find a situation in which it was actually a bad thing. But in FFCC, unlike most [good] RPGs, the game is MAPLESS - so don't you dare wander around in a town you aren't familiar with, or else you'll be running in circles forever due to the rotating camera that makes it impossible to tell which way you just came from--because you are -always- facing a different direction. I'm sure I've actually spent longer wandering stupidly in pointless towns where the townsfolk tell you parts of a story you aren't privy to than I've spent fighting bosses. Navigating was certainly more DIFFICULT, that's for sure.In closing, the only reason I still own this game is because the store I purchased it from went out of business and I can no longer return it. Today, however, following this review, I will put this p.o.s. to rest underneath my massive pile of well-developed PS2 RPG's and forget it ever existed.",2,"You may say to yourself, ""Wow, that's a good deal.

But the lack of precision in the combat, variety of attacks, and weak magic variety kept it from being better.Combat is button mashing friendly, combo-based combat, where precision is helpful, but far from required.  Similar to GoW, but easier IMO, and not as varied.Magic is limited.  Customization is virtually non-existent, and there is little leveling.Took a bunch from Zelda, in a good way -- but the Dungeons don't have the grand puzzles the Zelda dungeons have. Instead every area/room has a locked door, with is its own self-contained puzzle to open that door -- that is usually quite obvious and very easy, though some were very enjoyable (nothing that should require a walkthrough).1.  Like Zelda, each dungeon has a new ability/weapon.  All are repeats from other puzzle games.  (a Horn that opens doors, a Boomerang to start that can hit switches form afar, a Grappling Hook, the gun from the game ""Portal,"" etc...)2.  that new ability is used to solve a variety of switch and platforming puzzles3.  that ability is also used to beat the boss of the dungeon4.  Skulls are the same as ""heart-containers"" in Zelda.  You get a full one for beating a dungeon -- but can also find 1/4 fragments around the world...every 4 adding another skull (exactly like hearts in Zelda)(same mechanics for your Magic meter) -- Like Zelda, you don't start full, but only start with 3 skulls as the default after dying, so planning your healing approach before big combat areas is necessary.)5.  Potions are exactly like Zelda -- you need to buy ""empty"" vessels, which can be used to store healing potionsHowever -- the world is fairly linear, and the story progresses like an action game -- with automatic saving pretty much after each battle sequence.  A Linear Zelda, without the cast of characters/communities, and no exploration is just not as fun.the Combat may be better than Zelda for some -- but I prefer precision, blocking and countering...than mashing a button.",3,More a button-masher action title than an Adventure or RPG,1337644800,"05 22, 2012"

And while I got that in bucketloads, it's only rarely engaging. The story plays out like film noir and has a hardened cop called Jack Slate (who really belongs in an 80s action movie) investigate his dad's murder only to end up being framed for various crimes and in the middle of huge conspiracy.And so the game has you blast and fight your way through prisons, mines, air-force bases, dockyards, factories, cliff-sides, nightclubs, construction yards, hotels and out of control airplanes all while accompanied by your faithful dog Shadow, the game's best feature. It feels like a cross betweenDie Hard VendettaandResident Evil 4as you seem to do nothing but shoot generic bad guys from start to finish. It becomes incredibly boring and is only slightly redeemed by a few intense shoot-outs. There IS the occasional fisticuffs but the ml&eacute;e system is poor to non-existent and there is no skill involved in defeating your opponent outside of button mashing.Plus, the graphics are rotten. The cut-scenes look right out of a mid-90s CD-ROM and the gameplay graphics may look adequate but have a very jerky habit and the camera system will drive you crazy. And the voice acting is quite bad too with the exception of a few lively characters. The guy who plays Jack Slate sounds as bored as a living human can possibly be.I can't rate this game particularly high. Find it somewhere cheap if you must, otherwise it's not the best shoot-em-up out there and I suggest you invest your time and money in something else.

Western-themed games are rare to say the least, and good ones are rarer still. This is the latter kind, and its mature themes make it even more remarkable - it's as close as you'll ever get to playing through an old Clint Eastwood film.You're cast as Red, a bounty hunter who's seeking to avenge the murder of his parents. His quest takes him through many bizarre locations and pits him against a wide variety of murderous outlaws. It's his job to shoot first and ask questions later... then again, he doesn't really ask questions, he just shoots people and leaves it at that.The game's levels are usually brief affairs that revolve around one particular set piece or another and are jam-packed full of people to kill. Fortunately, all that killing is mighty satisfying. There's hardly a wide variety of weapons to help you along despite the designers' best efforts to bring variety to the period setting, but the weapons that exist are cool enough to compensate. Area specific damage and gouts of blood and gore keep things visceral and compelling. Red can fire from cover if things get too hectic, but it's generally not an essential tactic - even if it is a welcome option. He's also got a Max Payne-like ability called ""Dead Eye,"" which allows him to slow time and take steady aim at his opponents.You don't only play as Red during the course of the game. There are several other characters and storylines to delve into, and while they sometimes steer the focus of the game's story in the wrong direction, it's generally a welcome change of pace. Red's native cousin, Shadow Wolf, enjoys a particularly entertaining mission that encourages stealth and a fair aim with a bow and arrow. Some of the other character missions feel tacked on, though - such as the Buffalo Soldier's wagon ride back to town.What's a western-themed action game without the occasional duel? Drawing on opponents is handled like a sort of minigame that generally fits well into the scheme of things. Unfortunately, it's too frustrating, particularly later in the game. It's more a matter of a luck than skill, and certainly could have been handled with more flair.It's far from perfect, but ""Red Dead Revolver"" should provide hours of fairly mindless but addictive fun. With the lack of competition, it easily earns its place as the best western-themed game ever released.

Arbuckle Jr. ""GSRJedi""","[4, 6]","Grabbing a stormtrooper with the Force, turning him into a Lightning Grenade by hitting him with Force Lightning, and causing him to explode by hurling him at a group of stormtroopers is incredibly satisfying.  LucasArts highly anticipated next chapter in the Star Wars saga does a good job of making you feel like a Sith.  It's hard not to feel Sithish when you flippantly toss someone off a cliff.  It's hard not to geek out when you throw a TIE Fighter at somebody.  These are all things the Force Unleashed does very, very right.You don't start off all-powerful.  You've got to train, and by train I mean kill lots of people.  The more flamboyant you're killing style, the more points you earn to level up.  As you level up you choose how you wish to better yourself.  Do you earn the ability to grab two enemies with Force Grip, or wait a level or two and power up your Force Lightning to damage multiple enemies.  This is made even easier because when you die you go back to the last checkpoint but your points stay the same; so if you die repeatedly you'll gain more force points.The Force Unleashed has been touted as the next part of the Star Wars saga, and I'd consider this to be as canon as the Clone Wars cartoon and Shadows of the Empire.  I thought the feel was right for a Star Wars chapter.  The story takes place between ROTS and ANH and you do find out what some characters have been up to.  As a Star Wars fan, I geeked out at some of the twists and plot points.  The story makes playing through the game to completion worth it.As satisfying as killing stormtroopers and jawas is that could have been the whole game, but sadly it's not.  You've got an assortment of abilities at your disposal with which to dispatch of enemies with.  This makes killing the basic troopers and enemies a joy.  Do you use a flurry of lightsaber attacks, throw your saber, bowl them into one another, or use the scenery, the possibilities are almost endless.  The problem comes in with your more advanced enemies.  Many of them are resistant to one or more of your Force powers for some reason (seriously, how does a Royal Guard block my Force Push?) so there's generally only one way to weaken them and when they show up it turns from a Vegas buffet (the Rio's buffet is my favorite) to airplane food choices.  You just don't get those fantastic ""Oh snap!"" moments that make the other enemies so much fun.The bosses and mini-bosses are just cheap fights generally.  Your awesome powers are pretty much negated and they block nearly all your attacks.  They really just are battles of attrition.  Most of them take place in two stages, so if you die on the second part you restart there while they're left with half health which makes them really easy and pretty much inconsequential.  They all end in quicktime events with some fantastic action, but you've got to sit and watch for which button to press in a short window of time meaning you can't really watch them.It took me about eight and a half hours to beat this game over two days.  The first day, I kept telling myself I'd quit after this level and just keep right on playing and couldn't put it down.  On day two, I couldn't wait to get home from work to continue playing, but I learned that the second half of the game gets repetitive and more of the flaws start to show up.  You start to deal with more and more advanced enemies and the level design really starts to wear on you.  With the interior levels, being shuttled through corridors make sense, but it's 2008 and I've got a lightsaber how is a mushroom holding me back?  The outdoor levels all feel the same and there's nothing of interest in them.  The camera works for the most part.  Except when fighting the larger enemies the camera is never back far enough to see them entirely.  So get used to seeing the legs on an AT-ST, because that's all you can see unless you jump up.  Most of the time you can't see these enemies health bar because of it so you don't know how much longer you need to keep whacking away at them.  A lot of the enemies have ranged attacks that knock you back.  They just happen to timed in such a manner that a lot of times you get knocked into a wall and as soon as you get up again, they're firing at you before you get a chance to move (I'm looking at your Purge Trooper).In the end I enjoyed my time with The Force Unleashed.  They do a lot to keep you on the leash though.  As much as they hyped DMM, you can't really destroy a lot of stuff.  I can charge my Force Push up and bend a steel door, but a fully charged push won't defeat a stormtrooper.  It's things like this which really lessen the ""kick butt with the Force"" ideal they had.  When you're killing stormtroopers the game shines, but beyond that, it's very tame.  Non Star wars fans probably wouldn't be as engrossed with the story and find the gameplay repetitive.  As an action game it's above average, it doesn't have the polish of a God of War, though it does have the Force.  You never know what you're going to get with Star Wars games and I thought this one was one of better ones.  I fully admit my affinity for Star Wars probably made me enjoy this more than it was worth.  I'm okay with that though because I grabbed a TIE Fighter and threw it at another TIE Fighter; and like so many moments of this game it was freaking awesome.",4,Apparently Cesar Milan was a QA tester for this game because The Force Unleashed is in fact quite leashed,1221696000,"09 18, 2008"

I've played a bunch of L5 games (Dark Cloud 1 & 2, Dragon Quest 8, Rogue Galaxy) and I can say the art is pretty much the same and a ton of ideas are recycled. Boss battles are unnecessarily difficult since in real time, your companions can't block powerful attacks on their own (bosses call their super attacks and give you barely enough time to change to a defensive stance to minimize damage). Other than that, the story is great and the animated sequences by Studio Ghibli are awesome. The Wizard's Tome is A-MAZE-ING!

The main advantage that this game has over its competitors is a good story, with gameplay features borrowed from Professor Layton, and extremely catchy beats. I found myself humming the tunes from this fairly shortly after playing it for the first time.The plot of the game is focused around a young Frenchman called Raphael, who goes around by night disguised as the notorious Phantom R, an art thief of great style and sophistication. The police are baffled at the ability of this young redheaded thief in a fashionable suit and fedora to disappear. Undoubtedly they asked the random redheaded civilian with glasses and no hat for information, but he didn't see anything. It's that kind of game. Raphael is searching for his father, who went missing years before. During his pursuit he finds himself entwined in the risen Emperor Napoleon's dastardly plans to take over the world. Fortunately his men are susceptible to timed dance moves.Sound ridiculous? Good, it's meant to. The plot is one of the most entertaining things about this game. Amusing and insane it takes our heroes on a tour of Paris and its environs. And Paris is very much on display here. The city looks gorgeous, even in the 2D that dominates the gameplay. When you do get to see a cinematic cutscene (in glorious 3D no less) it really sours.The rhythm games are cleverly based around this plot. For example, when sneaking into the Louvre you have to follow a beat to hide behind convenient statues and avoid the guards. When fighting Napoleon's men you have to punch them as they bounce at you in synchronized fashion. When eluding policemen on roller skates you have to jump or duck to avoid capture. And my personal favorite: you get to defend yourself against your archrival's PI child Charlie who attempts to apprehend you by kicking a flaming football at your face. They're all fun, not a little bit silly, and have a catchy beat.The parts of the game not revolving around playing rhythm games owe a very large debt to Professor Layton. Not so much the puzzle aspect, but the way that you move your character along a map and use the touchscreen to interact with the characters and scenery on it. They even have playcoins you can collect by tapping random areas of the screen. The character and street designs are very nice. These are seen at their full effect when the cutscenes start. These cutscenes are beautifully animated and really capture a spirit of adventure. I wish they would make this into an Anime so we could see it all animated. The 3D is used to good effect in these, especially the first cutscene which has Raphael dancing around a room filled with chandeliers. The rest of the game doesn't use it much, and it's often easier to just turn it off.Most of this game takes place on the bottom screen. The top screen has a map and is used for all the wonderful 3D cutscenes, but when traveling you pay attention to the touchscreen. In battles the top screen becomes important. These battles alternate between having you tap buttons on the bottom screen with your stylus and hitting buttons. No, you don't have to do both at the same time. That would be horrifyingly difficult.The downsides to the game are fairly minor but annoying. The rating system is messed up. The game doesn't record your best scores, only an average of all your scores. This means that if you want the game to save you getting an A-Rank score you have to get it right on your first time. Which is almost impossible. Another flaw is the grading system for these ranks. It is too heavily focused on what your last move was. You can get a perfect score right up until the end and then flub only the last note, dropping you down to a C-Rank. It's very irritating.If any of this sounds compelling try the demo. It's available for free on the Nintendo store. This is one fun game even for non rhythm game fans. While the game doesn't always add up to the sum of its parts, nevertheless it provides a fun ride.",5,Professor Layton with a Beat,1387411200,"12 19, 2013"

You start off on 50 cc and try to beat the first cup, and you unlock one of the new 30 courses of this game and you also unlock new speed classes, 100 cc and 150 cc.  The graphics for a handheld game are great, the character models, weapons and courses are very clear and colorful.  There are 8 characters to choose from, just like the SNES and N64 games.  You can race with Mario, Peach, DK, Bowser, Luigi, Toad, Yoshi and Wario.  Along the way you unlock 4 more characters, Dry Bones, Daisy, Wario and Robot.  You can unlock up to 5 cars for each person so each character has 7 cars, although you need to be certain people to play with certain vehicles.  As far as the weapons go, there are three new ones, but gone are the specials from Double Dash.  This game seems like a slimmer version of Double Dash, the Gamecube version of Mario Kart, and it is in characters and vehicles.  But there is one thing that makes up for this, multiplayer.

That's the single word that best summarizes this sham of a release by Activision and Infinity Ward.They have betrayed everyone possible at every step they could. They betrayed their own PC roots by not including dedicated server support, a staple feature of practically every multiplayer first person shooter in the past 10 years. With the removal of dedicated servers also goes custom map support, mod support, and competitive (clan) gaming support, again, all staples of practically every multiplayer first person shooter in the past 10 years. They further betrayed all PC gamers by raising the price by $10, with absolutely nothing to make up for it.I would claim that they even betrayed Steam, the very platform they base the game's activation server and anti-cheat server, by not allowing digital download copies of the game to be activated on release day. This will no doubt cause a flurry of cancellations from Steam as impatient gamers go out to buy the boxed copy instead.It's also ironic that they betrayed the very reason that they gave for dropping dedicated server support: simplicity for casual players. Instead of browsing a list of available servers, many players are now told that they must change their NAT settings from ""strict"" to ""open"". If you don't know what I just said, don't worry, I'm sure most people have no idea what a NAT even is.I can give many other examples of such betrayals, but I'll leave it with this: I believe that Activision has betrayed the entire gaming industry.

What initially drew me in were the customizable gaming controls, the multi-colored adjustable backlighting and the dual USB ports perfect for minimizing cord clutter by placing a headset and mouse conveniently within reach. When I first bought the Merc Stealth, it was everything I had hoped for and then some. After a few months of owning it, however...The software that comes pre-packaged with the keyboard is oudated, so you will have to download both updated drivers and software from the manufacturer's website to get it working properly. The software provides an excellent selection of pre-built keysets that you can download directly from the Zboard client as well as the option to build your own, and the manufacturer provides regular updates. The numerical keys are perfect for macroing all of your spells and items within MMOs like World of WarCraft, and the other gaming keys are well placed for easy use with fast-paced shooters like Call of Duty and F.E.A.R., which is primarily what I used the gaming keys for. The volume controls are within easy reach and the backlighting adjusts in three colors (red, blue and purple) with three levels of brightness each. Very spiffy! The sensitivity of the keys was just right for me and nothing was too much of a stretch to reach. Now on to the downsides...Firstly, the number pad is jumbled and really difficult to get used to, especially if you have a job where you use the standard 10-key placement regularly. I also hated that the Delete/Insert/End/Home/Page Up/Page Down keys are attached to the number keys instead of being separate, independent keys (they toggle with NumLock). This was a sacrifice made in the interest of keeping the rest of the keyboard compact due to the extra length for the gaming keys. I guess it doesn't matter if ALL you do is gaming, but for multi-use it isn't very practical.My absolute biggest gripe was the quality of the substance covering the keys. Within 3 months of purchasing this keyboard I started to notice the paint wearing off of the keys, which are made of clear plastic. By the time 6 months rolled around my most commonly used keys were almost completely worn off, and at 2+ years of usage I literally have no readable keys except for Q, Z and P. If I did not know my keys by heart the poor quality of the coating would have rendered this keyboard completely unusable.All in all, not a bad buy if you don't plan on using it daily for more than a year. If you are a bit more of a hardcore and devoted gamer, splurge a little extra for something with something with higher quality coating and a NumPad that actually makes sense.",3,Great! ...for the first few months.,1314230400,"08 25, 2011"

The game is themed around the Mario Universe with lots of characters and courses to keep you busy. This game has lots of content for the money. You get lots of 1 player modes as well as good online modes that will keep you coming back for more. There is a mode In the game called Castle Club which is a Rpg take on golf which you use your mii. You compete in different tournaments and buy clothing for your Mii. You have to play this mode if you wanna unlock some courses and some characters. The problem with this mode is that there is not really much to do its kinda short. Most of the time you will probably be online or in the single player part of the game. Over all this is a good game for Mario Golf fans or even fans of the sport. The reason I give it a 4  stars is because the Castle Club mode doesn't really add much to the game. There is one miner problem when your Golfing the problem is the camera is not that  good so getting that perfect shot is kinda hard expecially when your putting. But besides those miner problems this game is very good for the price with lots of content both offline and online.

Having played the first one a year or so ago, I was looking forward to snapping this one up and I wasn't disappointed. You do really need to play the first one before you go for this sequel though, as it follows directly on. This time Isaac has awoken in hosptital after the trauma of Dead Space 1 and finds that the monsters have followed him...your mission is to escape the hospital, get yourself through a whole space colony and back to the dreaded Ishimura ship to settle the whole business.The game looks and feels the same as the first edition, although it does seem more polished and sharp now. The graphics are amazing, everything looks real. Character faces looks like they are actually having emotions. The monsters are hideous and very dangerous. There isn't a lot of let up in the fear of attack...very few places feel 100% safe, and you can be pounced on at any time. Luckily there are some tasty weapons available and these can be upgraded to your liking with items and money that you find scattered about. There are new weapons and monsters this time around, and the location is new too.Some highlights for me are: the residential area where people are seen fleeing in panic, or screaming behind closed doors as monsters attack all around, then the outside sections floating in space, plus the final chapter of the game where you return to the dreaded Ishimura which takes on the atmosphere of some kind of haunted house, as you prowl around the now deserted corridors and chambers - works very well if you remember how you were dashing around these same locations in a panic in the first game. The suspense factor is high - sometimes I was creeping so slowly around corners and through doors, because the game throws a LOT of jump-scares at you. Some of the new monsters are very bothersome, in particular some weird chicken like things that peer at you from behind cover before stampeding at you at lightning speed.It's an 18 certificate for a good reason, there are many gory scenes, lots of nasty looking corpses and body parts, and some wince-making eyeball violence (hint: get the ""eye-injection"" scene wrong just once to see a truly hideous death sequence!).I have nothing but praise for this game, it's so professionally put together and at no point did I think it was unfair or too difficult - in some ways it can be quite easy, but that doesn't mean you won't die a lot!Fully recommended, grab it with the free ""Extraction"" game while the limited edition is out - this is a full game in itself (It's not a 2nd disc, but you download the file onto your PS3 hard-drive from the main game disc). This is a side game played in 1st person using the Move control. I thought this was going to be just a shooter on rails, but there is a lot of variety and its not just about shooting. It's not as good as the main event (I would have been surprised if it had been as it's free!), because you have to use a lot of buttons on the Move controller which is fiddly, but it's still made to the same high standards.Both excellent releases for the PS3, and worth a purchase",5,Fun and scary,1297468800,"02 12, 2011"

11967,198838,A2L0OPNG1DZVQD,B0072A4JVW,mjc0961,"[1, 3]","Sadly, this device has failed at both of its functions for me.  For one, as many other reviewers have complained about, the grips on this are too small to be of use to anyone with big hands.  This really baffles me, as the entire point of a grip product like this is to make these handheld game systems with barely any room built in for holding it easier to hold for those with large hands.  Such a thing is almost essential for the Vita as unlike other devices, the majority of the back of the device is a ""do not touch"" zone for any game that uses rear touch pad inputs.  This grip is so small that playing any such game renders the grip completely unusable: you still have to hold the Vita in the same way you'd hold it without the grip to avoid having your fingers touching the rear touch pad.  That is, if you don't want to inflict pain upon yourself.  You can curl your fingers behind the grip which makes my fingers feel uncomfortable and even worse, causes the ends of the grip to dig into my palms which quickly becomes painful.  Basically, unless you have small hands, this thing is pretty much useless as a grip.The other feature are the triggers.  Unlike the grip feature which might as well be non-existent to my large hands, the triggers actually hamper gameplay by being awful and really cheap feeling.  The biggest problem I have with them is that the amount you have to press them to register an input feels vastly greater to me than what the bare Vita shoulder buttons require.  This is insanely noticeable to me while playing Uncharted on Crushing difficulty.  Previously I could easily hold L to peek out of cover to aim, quickly line up a shot, quickly press R to fire and then let go of L to pop back down.  This is no longer possible with the trigger grips on my Vita and the game is much harder now.  I'm either out of cover for a fraction of a second longer than I normally would be to take a shot and get killed (anyone who has played Crushing themselves knows how even an extra fraction of a second can be the difference between life and death), or I don't get a shot off at all due to not jamming the trigger down far enough for the game to register a button press, which generally leads to a greater number of live enemies who are now able to advance on my position and kill me that way.  They should have made the entire trigger piece less tall so you don't have to pull as hard to get an input, or used more than a tiny little nub on the inside to press the Vita's button.  Inside of the grip is a tiny little 5/32"" by 3/8"" nub that presses the Vita's shoulder button.  Something with more surface area may have had an easier time of pushing the button (the Vita's shoulder buttons are designed so that you can push it anywhere and it should work, but they work better if you can press the entire thing down rather than just pushing on one end of them).The other problem is just how cheap the triggers are.  They're so stiff that every time I pull them, they feel like they're going to break or worse, damage my Vita.  They're also really stiff, it takes a lot of force to push them down far enough to register anything and again, it also takes a bigger, or perhaps deeper, push to register.  All of these problems with the trigger just combine to make using the shoulder buttons a much harder, much less accurate affair.  It's really quite horrible, and are what earn this grip their 1 star rating, rather than the 2 or 3 stars they could have gotten as just a grip that ended up being too small for my big hands but could have had use for those with small hands.  The triggers completely ruin this thing, I would not recommend this device to anyone because of them.  Take a look at other Vita grips, every other grip I've seen does not cover up the Vita's shoulder buttons.  Buy one of those grips and forget about this awful trigger grip.",1,Grips are too small for large hands and triggers feel cheap and nasty.,1357257600,"01 4, 2013"

And be WARNED: The single player campaign takes less than SIX HOURS; it's far too short and repetitive to recommend seriously to a gamer at $59, $49, or even $39 price points.  Ryse makes a great tech demo for XBOX ONE, but it's not fleshed out enough to take seriously. It's evident that this game was rushed to be available at the launch of the XBOX ONE.  Aside from being incredible monotonous, the game is on rails, the boss fights are incredibly simple, and had it been a film, it would have fallen flat at the box office.  It's hard to care about the characters for some reason.  Overall, this game will make a fantastic overnight rental or be perfect once it hits the $19 price point.In the meantime, load up on games like Killer Instinct, Forza 5, and NBA 2K14 for XBOX One.  Those are a few of the games that truly shine right now for the new console.",3,"Marius is a better character than Kratos will ever be, but this game is a one and done.",1385510400,"11 27, 2013"

If you've played both then you can probably see why playing C2 before Homefront would be a bad thing - it's a tough act to follow.Now I knew nothing about Homefront other than the basic premise which is 'Red Dawn' type antics involving the Korean army. As soon as the single player campaign begins you can tell what you're in for - Black Ops style of repetitive escort missions where you're nothing more than an extra in a movie. This game isn't about you, it's about a whole bunch of unknown people that you don't care about, and you're just along for the ride. Except this isn't a fun ride, it's a ride whereby you must continuously follow some people while being surrounded and out-numbered by never-ending bad guys and rewarded with extremely limited ammo. The game expects you to run-and-gun constantly. The fact that there's several achievements for doing parts of the game under 200 seconds or so shows what little regard the devs had in terms of allowing you to play the game your way. You cannot take your time as you'll be overrun, you cannot form a strategy as you'll be out of ammo and thus you're just pushing down and forward on the left stick. They may as well have made your character run forward by default to save wear on the button.It's such an unpleasant experience. I'm amazed no-one at THQ said ""Hey guys, this isn't much fun. Let's drop the infinitely spawning stupid AI and allow the player some freedom"". Surely someone who worked on this tripe must have realized what a nasty little game they've made?But then there's the bugs. At many points I could see where the bad guys were spawning- just appearing out of thin air and following exactly the same behavior as the last one. And main characters walked through me revealing their innards and at one point I ended up floating 40 foot in the air only to fall to my death. Plus the in game dialog (as terrible as it is) is forced upon you - there's scores of parts of the game where you're stuck on the spot and you have to endure some dull, badly acted exchange between the characters. And should you die before a checkpoint you will have to listen to it again. And again. Replay value is nil on this one.The graphics side of things fair little better. It's clunky over-saturated blocky vomit thrown up from the stomach of 2001's graphic technology. The shadow maps have a resolution of about 5 pixels and there's many points in the game where visual dressings such as fallen leaves or puddles are Z plane clipped (this means they flicker sometimes or part of the bitmap is buried under the ground). Sound is equally bad with the barks from the NPCs being repeated over and over again. Connor, the guy who you follow, says ""Hey... over here"" every two seconds until you join him. It's so lazy.Now I tried MP too and the first thing that annoyed me is having to put in the supplied one-time-use MP online code. This drops the resale value of this game considerably if you use the code - something to consider if you resell your games after a while. MP itself seemed little more than spawn, random death, random spawn, random death and so was not really doing it for me. The maps are huge but unlike say, Battlefield 1943 which allows some choices on your spawn point, I always seemed to spawn either right in the middle of the action or about a mile away. Perhaps there's a way of controlling your spawn point but when an enemy spawned right next to where I was crouching I shut it off. I doubt I'll revisit it.In summation - not worth your time or money. If you haven't done so yet, buy Crysis 2 and support a developer who respects gamers and gives value for money.",2,God awful rubbish,1302220800,"04 8, 2011"

I don't believe my shoe-tying motion on the couch resembled anything like a standing shoulder circle movement.This just adds to my belief that it isn't tracking my movements accurately, so I just might go sit on the couch, have a milk shake and get credit for a 200 calorie burn.(wait, I just stood in front of the Kinect, and ""ran"" a lap by just making my arms go through the pumping motion (of running) the more I pumped, the faster I ran. But my legs were still. Maybe it's tracking my heart rate or something)I own Ubisoft's Yourshape evolved, and thought it's a good program, but a tiny bit quirky, and in some ways, not as sporty as I had hoped.So I decided to try EA Sports Active 2. Was a bit excited about the heart rate monitor. I think it's a useful tool and a good motivator. I understand it made the program 2x more expensive than your average Kinect title, but was willing to try.I've been trying to compare the various exercise program reviews for kinect, and couldn't quite make sense of the info out there, so had to buy the three main ones. Yourshape, EA Sports Active, Biggest Loser (and although I had one friend that was very excited about Zumba [she's a true believer], the reviews looked not too promising)-I think if this were a workout video (DVD), or even a Wii product, it would be considered fine. But the game/program navigation is terribly cumbersome, confusing and doesn't take advantage of Kinect's abilities. Other reviewers aren't kidding when they say it's easier to use the product with the controller.I also think that given the camera usage, tracking, I don't want to be looking at a wii-ish avatar.-I also don't understand why for the majority of the exercises, the avatar either isn't mimicking me at all (it models the exercise, so your only understanding that you aren't doing it correctly is that you aren't getting credit for the repetition on the set), or the avatar is moving awkwardly (running in place doesn't match with my movements)-Tracking tracking tracking. I've heard people talking about it's not reading them while doing floor based exercises. I went in with that in mind.But I didn't expect that it would keep losing my cursor/hand during set up and for all the menu options. I had to pick up the controller, and/or keep waving my arms around to try and find the hand, which was very frustrating. Tracking when choosing menus is no where up to par. All my other kinect titles do significantly better.- Menu choices/wording/placement are cumbersome and odd. Not impossible, just cumbersome.I know that this program wasn't designed specifically for Kinect, but it's to the point where ""master of none"" might apply. I think if I had this running on my Wii, I might be very happy, but this one was purchased for the kinect, and the interface is just poor.Summary:Pros:Heart rate monitor!!!! :)StatisticsVariety of exercisesCons:tracking for exercise and menuing horribleI can sit on my couch and it thinks i'm exercising (same technology as working out to a 1980's vhs Richard Simmons video)This is a kinect. You can take pictures. I don't have to spend 20 minutes designing my avatar. I'd rather you make the avatar track my movements than put him in sunglassesBottom Line:If the technology for tracking isn't working well, and the game/menu design (logically, graphically, decision tree) is a generation behind... what's the point? But if this program wasn't on the Kinect, and the only thing on the market, I'd sooner suggest it.Ubisoft's Yourshape might be a little less masculine/sporty, but i'll probably be using it instead.",2,"Obviously not designed for kinect, not accurate",1290470400,"11 23, 2010"

This means anybody who spent good money on a widescreen HDTV has to play the game with vertical black bars on the side...talk about a waste of real estate!- Horrible interface designs. Dynasty mode allows for detailed management, the problem is that its a pain to try and do anything! What's the point of managing your farm systems if all it does is create more of a headache?- We still can't move around in the batters box. How difficult is this to add to a game?!?! We could do this on Nintendo 20 years ago, but somehow in MVP you can only move your batter to 3 positions.- The fielding is absolutely horrible. Back in the early days of Triple Play they had it right with speed burst buttons, now its just sluggish. Watch a ball get hit into the gap - you wont find any help from the other outfielders.- MVP difficulty is silly. When you have CPU controlled leadoff hitters and pitchers hitting HRs in their cold zones, you know that the CPU has a slight advantage over you.- The commentary is awful!!! EA has gone with the SF Giants broadcasters (Glen Kuiper & Mike Krukow) once again, and while they're actually good in real life - the lines they're given in the game are painful to listen to. I've never once heard them say ""Dude"" during a Giants game, however its peppered throughout this one (""This DUDE is having a big game"", ""You don't want to make a mistake to this DUDE"", ""This DUDE...etc""). When they're not saying ""dude"" they substitute it with ""Big Boy"".- Hitting is subpar. There still isnt a ""power"" swing option. The ""true hitting system"" that EA advertises is the same hitting system used in RBI Baseball on NES (Up for flyball, Down for grounder, etc).- Weak ratings systems. There is no numerical OVR rating for players, you have to go by some vague progress bar.- No lead offs! I'll repeat that again...NO LEAD OFFS!!! Actually you can lead off, but the only way to do so is by sending the runner. In other words, you cant take a bigger lead without trying to steal...which is STUPID!There are more flaws, but you have to play this game for yourself to find all the annoyances.Its like the took last years game, didnt improve ANY of the bugs or flaws in it, and simply added a couple new features with even more flaws of their own.I do NOT recommend this game.

While similar compilations from Midway and Namco are bare-bones sets with 4 games and a few extras, the Activision Anthology contains no less than 48 games from the Atari 2600. It is also kicked up a notch with a nice 80's soundtrack and extras you can unlock by playing the games.By far, the best games are Kaboom!, Pitfall, Spider Fighter, Megamania, and Plaque Attack. These are classics I remember having as a kid. There is also a nice selection of sports games (Ice Hockey, Skiing, Baseball) for those who enjoy the 2 player mode. All games come with original graphics and sound effects, and even scans of the original boxes and manuals. Added to this is a nice selection screen which resembles a bedroom, and the music adds to the 80's feeling. Anyone feeling nostalgic will love this compilation.But like all compilations of this type, there is a certain amount of filler. Some of the games are terrible, even by Atari standards. I would love to have had games like Moon Patrol and Q'bert included, but there are a few games here that are pointless and boring. Also, while the addition of 80's music is a nice touch, the selection is somewhat limited to 10 songs.

5519,67754,A3VK5RYGU94X5Q,B000FKBCX4,Critical Grad,"[4, 4]","As mentioned in some posts, Spore was supposed to be revolutionary in a lot of ways.  This was a game of life!  You were going to grow, evolve and attempt to become a dominant species in many different aspects.  My best advice for gamers who still have not gotten their hands on it is to try not to get your hopes up too much.  You will be done with this title faster than a soft-serve ice cream cone.Again, Spore is supposed to be a game about life and evolving yourself as a creature.  You will encounter 5 different stages in this game: cellular, creature, tribe, civilization, and space.  Each has a different style of game play and different look to it.There are two very noticeable aspects to this game that are definitely pros.  First, the game is VERY pretty.  You will notice this first when you are in the cellular level.  Out of all 5 levels, this is the one I spent the 3rd most time on and have come back to many, many times.  You will want to spend a lot of time on it...but cannot-we will talk about that later.  The one I spent the 2nd most amount of time on was the creature stage, which is also very pretty.The second aspect that excited gamers and still keeps them playing is the customization of, well, just about EVERYTHING in the game!  You have the power to create any creature, vehicle, and building you want in the game.  The most awesome part is that it is not solely aesthetic either.  The very advanced creative engine helps you to make creature that will use all their limbs the way a creature with those proportions would.  This is physics to a whole new level folks.  The same goes with vehicles.  You can make boats, planes and land craft that move however you want them to.  I remember making my own mech just like in the game Mechwarrior and it moved like it too.  The possibilities are simply endless.Another awesome aspect about the endless creations are that you can share them with many different spore users on the net.  It is literally a fan made universe.With all this glimmer, you must be wondering how can Spore be receiving these horrible reviews, including yours!  Well, it comes down to this folks:  gameplay in itself lacks serious depth and you will pass through each level probably faster than you would like, no matter what difficulty you are on...all except for the space stage and you will be begging for that one to be over with!It all starts with the cell stage.  As you grow, you do not get the same pleasure the other ginormous creatures get eating you.  You grow very fast and next thing you know, you are forced to go on land.  The creature stage is one of the longer stages and one of the most fun, however in a game of evolution and ecology, it seriously lacks depth.  I would have loved to have seen hundreds of different creatures running around, slowly trying to manage their region, etc. and then giving YOU the decision HOW you want to evolve.  Should you grow in intelligence or size.  But that is not what happens in this game.  You are then thrown to your next level.Now it may seem exciting to come to the point where you can make vehicles and really get some strategy into play, but that isn't going to happen.  You might deck out a vehicle with 100 guns and expect it to be a massive killing machine, but the only result is a small boost in killing power.  In fact, only 1 of those guns will actually fire.  Sad, right?  Customization in this game, including that of your creature is only face level most of the time and has little impact on the strength of your creature, vehicle or building.Each subsequent level goes by faster and lacks more and more depth.  Then you get to the space stage.  This is a simply endless level that has you running around doing tasks and will force you to ultimately run back and forth defending your planets from invaders like crazy.  Where does it end?  You can try to find the center of the universe where a cutscene will talk to you and then you can continue on the game.So should you buy it or not?  This is the first time that I have ever given a game such a low rating and yet been hesitant to say no.  The reason is that there is potential for some to get enjoyment simply out of the endless creations they can make.  In fact, before the game came out, there were already thousands of creatures made on the creature creator.  There is a lot of enjoyment in the music, funny creatures, and awesome vehicles that can be created, but for those that are looking to DO more and not create more, your enjoyment will be over before you know it.In brief, if you are a creative person and LOVE the fact that you can make your own buildings, creatures and vehicles, then the game is perfect for you and you can expect to get minutes, hours, days and months worth of enjoyment out of it.  You people SHOULD buy it.  For those of you who are not, I still recommend trying it, but maybe watch it at a friends house or borrow it.",2,A Game of Life Oversimplified,1245283200,"06 18, 2009"

I did play through the original Half Life, and its difficulty (especially in the later stages) was a bit of a turn-off. Personally, I think that when the game practically necessitates cheating to complete it, it's a bit too much. That said, seeing this bundle on the store shelf was a bit too good of a deal to pass up, so I picked it up.First impressions on the game design- the physics is more heavily involved in gameplay than in any other shooter before or since. In fact, in many cases the gameplay seems to FOCUS on the physics, not on killing enemies. To underscore this, you can actually finish most of the game with only the gravity gun, which (except in rare cases) can't kill anything directly but can pick up objects to throw at enemies. This is an interesting departure from the norm, but there are times when I think they took it a bit too far. Typically, you'll start off killing enemies and will have the normal frantic bursts of action, but you'll eventually run into a puzzle. These are usually something as simple as a locked door or elevator, and you simply (or not) have to open it or turn it on. Most of the puzzles can be figured out given a reasonable amount of effort on the player's part, but there are a few that will undoubtedly frustrate to the point where you simply look it up. I guess this is fine, so long as you aren't highly averse to cheating in such a fashion. I will say, when you do get where you're going, you do feel a sense of accomplishment at having figured it out.The game's graphics are pretty good even for now, and voice acting is well done. The environments are well made and look realistic in a sort of grim alien/post-apocalyptic style. It's nothing that will blow you away after seeing next-gen titles, but it's none too shabby either. Additionally, the episodes feature graphic improvements. If you have bought a machine anytime in the last 3-4 years, chances are it'll run smoothly at max settings. The game is quite stable as well, though it doesn't seem to like being minimized. One thing to note is that the game does take quite a while to start up and has occasional- and sometimes rather jarring- load pauses. These usually take place in a featureless corridor, and I found that after a while I could tell when it was about to stop to load.The original HL2 is generally a good story and great pace, save for one glaring thing. There are two sequences where you're driving a vehicle around, and it's my opinion (and most I've mentioned it to agree) that these are just WAY too long. It's almost as if the developers were justifying the time they spent making the vehicles work by stretching out these sequences to a ridiculous length. Some other interesting notes are that allies are somewhat useful now, and the variety of enemies is enough that they don't get overly repetitive. Particularly, there is a point where you get to command an endless horde of weak critters to overwhelm a horde of enemies (fortunately, not endless), which is one of the highlights of the game.The episodes (1 and 2) more or less follow the same style of the original. You lose all your weapons at the start of each one, which is rather irritating, and they aren't especially long installments. They largely serve to drive the plot along, which is actually getting interesting enough that I'm looking forward to the finale. You spend most of your time with Alyx backing you up, which is good if you hate being lonely, but somewhat of a shift in gears from the core game where you're largely solo. There are a few surprises and new enemies along the way, and enough new environments to make things fun.Additionally, this package comes with Team Fortress and Portal, which are a multiplay shooter and puzzle game respectively. I haven't looked into either extensively since I largely bought this pack to get the Half Life content, but it's a nice bonus.The only big gripe I have about the Orange Box is something that a lot of other people have complained about- specifically, Steam and the Valve DRM. If you don't have a live internet connection you CANNOT play any of the games since it needs to connect to Steam to authenticate you. Steam also performs updates whenever you launch, so patching is not optional and can eat into your game time when you don't particularly want it to. There were times when I was playing some online game, my internet died, and I figured to just play some HL2 instead... and after a few minutes sitting on the 'Now loading...' prompt I remembered it wasn't going to work either. This, like many other aspects of Half Life 2, is different from any other shooter out there- but not in a pleasant way. Personally, I don't see why it can't authenticate once in 3 launches, or even every other launch.

The emotions run extremely high with this game. And that in and of itself indicates how much people care about the characters and plots.I've been reviewing video games since the days of Adventure and Zork, and of course there have been many atrocious games along the way. People who play atrocious games tend to be fairly blase about it. ""Yes it sucks. Move on."" However, with Mass Effect 3 it is an entirely different set of emotion. The emotions here are more along the lines of ""I adored my character. I invested hundreds of hours into carefully crafting his life, his moral choices, and the people he fell in love with. And then THIS!!!""I think it's important to realize how powerful this situation is. Only a mere ten years ago people would argue that video games could not capture the emotion. They would argue that there was no way to connect with a video game. We have proven here, in 2012, that absolutely a video game can be FAR more immersive than a movie or a novel. With a video game you become invested in the story, you help craft the path, and you emotionally connect with the characters.Think of all the areas that Mass Effect 3 opened horizons. It offered heterosexual and homosexual relationships and most people didn't blink an eye. It offered a range of ethnicities and hardly a word was spoke about it. Moral choices were presented, and people made their decisions. People cared.So I think it absolutely should then be expected that these years of investment, these weeks of time and emotion and energy should have a pay-off at the end. Yes, gamers paid the $x amount for the game - but that is trivial compared with the investment of their time and energy. They expect, after all of that, that what they did mattered.And, in the end, it didn't.The summation of the game - as undoubtedly the vast majority of gamers know by now - is completely independent of what the gamer chose to do. Relationship choices didn't matter. Alliance choices didn't matter. Morals, good, or bad, or ugly, didn't matter. The game makers simply pulled with a razor and ended the story.There are some gamers who posit that this shouldn't matter. Oh well. It was a noble end. We should be satisfied.But again, this is not about a movie we watched for 90 minutes while munching popcorn. It was an investment. If you were in a five year relationship with a partner, where you lived with them, cared for them, and made a focused effort to make things work, would you be content with a five minute razor-blade slicing off of the relationship? How would that ever be considered adequate? And, once your partner had done that to you, would you say to yourself, ""Oh well, they were nice to me before""?Absolutely I feel strongly that the way one closes a relationship is one of the most important, powerful things a person in a relationship can do. I feel BioWare failed in this act - and by doing so they tainted all that came before.Ask any woman or man who has been through a nasty divorce what they remember. Is it the few years of joy - or is it the way they were treated at the end.For those who didn't mind the ending at all, I'm not sure what to say. If someone was in a five year marriage and they don't really mind that their partner cheated on them nastily and laughed as they ran off with the money - what does that say about the person's emotional investment in that relationship?I purchased this game with my own funds for the purpose of doing this review.",2,A Responsibility to a Long Term Relationship,1336608000,"05 10, 2012"

The gun's just don't feel right and you really don't get as much of a choice as you would think rolling through missions, sure you could make you own way through the levels, but if you don't go about it the way the game WANTS you to, you are in for some trouble.

Simply stated, that is a load of crap. My computer is well above the specs for recommended hardware for this game and I cannot play it for 10 minutes without going into an epileptic seizure.There are just too many buggs to list. Strange lights flashing, objects dissapearing and reappearing, falling through the world, camera angles sticking are just a fraction of the problems I encountered during the first 5 minutes of playing.Load times? This is a joke. I have way more graphics intensive programs and this thing takes at least 5 minutes to load. Try to save once. If you are lucky enough not to crash you should go find something else to do for about 10 minutes, perhaps go brush your teeth.Worst of all, go to the game developers website and look at the suggested tweaks. I dont know about you but when I play a game I want to relax and enjoy it. I certainly dont want to have to input countless lines of code and change advanced settings for hours just to get the thing to run. Even after giving it an honest effort most of the tweaks did nothing to enhance to gameplay anyways.My advice to anyone interested in buying this awful game is DON'T.

10548,222646,AY8THNLBY3IPL,B00CRL9TU2,Daniel L. Carter,"[5, 7]","I am in no way a person that typically has issues with Gran Turismo. I loved and watched and probably played at least some of Gran Turismo 1 and 2. I have owned Gran Turismo 3,4,5,6 and even the motorcycle Gran  Turismo gasme that was made for Playstation 2. The reason I own a Playstation 3 is so I could play Gran Turismo 5. If I ever do buy a Playstation 4 it will probably be to play Gran Turismo 7. So why a 2 star rating for Gran Turismo 6?...Fun... People who make video games have somehow in large part forgotten the reason why a video game should be made or exist. Fun, Fun, Fun,... this should be the motto hanging on the wall of any video game producer. Gran Turismo 6 has some fun, for sure, but it has way to much Frustration! I have no clue, why they thought every single race should start with all cars already in motion, and with the lead cars, plenty far out in the lead.They did a great thing with making the license test bronze times much easier to attain, for unlocking new races, but the one HUGE thing that has frustrated me to no end, is the GT World Championship Race that must be won, or at least a bronze medal earned to be able to unlock the S license  TESTS so that the rest of the races can be unlocked. I do not have good eye sight, as a result of Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (if anyone reading this has M.S. I believe it should stand for Mercury Saturated, look at the known health effects of Mercury toxicity and compare those with your symptoms. Any silver filling you may have in your mouth is 50% mercury, I had ten of them, the progression has mostly stopped since having them PROPERLY removed) that has put me in a motorized wheelchair basically every waking moment. The crazy difficulty of this race combined with my poor eyesight has kept me from even being able to attempt the S-license tests. The thing I have always loved about Gran Turismo is the endurance races. I love racing cars, and I really wanted to see any improvements that may have been made to the pit stops since Gran Turismo 5. I have collected every single car that I could find in GT5. In GT6 I have purchased a 2 million credit formula car, which I will never be able to race with until I get my S-license. I've currently got 4 cars (not counting the formula car) with over 700 performance points each and so far have not been able to get third place or better in any of the races I need to pass to unlock the S-license tests with.How Gran Turismo 6 could have been a 5 star game, and how Gran Turismo 7 could very easily be a 5 star game in my book:Every Gran Turismo game has had TONS of cars and a whole lot of race tracks. Why are there less races than there are cars??? They should make at least one race that is exclusive to every car in the game and then just add lots and lots more races to the game. It is supposed to be a game about racing, Right? Put the cars and tracks to use in a huge way. I do not care if there are all kinds of races that I will never be able to win, but make a ton of races that everybody will be able to win, and structure the game in a way where everyone can at least have access to starting most any type of race that is in the game. Winning races is of course based to at least some degree of skill, but most people who participate in any race are not going to be the winners of the race. Gran Turismo is supposed to be about racing, so please let people get into the races, that is what anyone wants to do that buys a Gran Turismo game. This would make the replay value potentially nearly unlimited and in my book would make it a 5 star game.Damage and the ability to turn it on or off would of course be a fun plus. I have loved the Red Bull X cars, and I really like the future prototypes that look to be added to GT6. Hopefully eventually I will unlock the S-license tests.Notice even with my bad review, I have not totally given up on the game. There is a lot to like, but the amount of frustration drives me to the point of wanting to give up. Frustration is basically the opposite of fun. Frustrating and hard races can be ok, but they should be optional races that do not hinder reaching major portions of the game. I would love to see Gran Turismo 7 sell 100 million copies, due to it being massively fun, fun, fun. Like it very easily could be.Update 1/4/2014One good thing to wait for maybe? B-spec mode when released may make it easier to get the super license tests opened up, so that the other races will unlock. This would be very positive, also grinding in B-spec for money should be much easier.One more very irritating and FRUSTRATING thing with gt6. Apparently they really wanted to showcase how totally lame, totally lame tires function. So for ALL of the races I have seen so far, the BEST tires you can use is racing hard. This would be great for someone, if there is someone, who really loves driving really powerful race cars, that go totally out of control any time you want to do something like turn your car. Realistic behaving tires are fine and good, but it is NO FUN to be forced to drive on lame tires while trying to catch up to cars that were a half a lap ahead of you, when the race began.",2,A game with all of the makings of a 5 star game that is worth only maybe 2 stars.,1387756800,"12 23, 2013"

I fi nished the ME3 in three weeks time, enjoyed every minute of it....except  the ending.Differences:- No matter what gun you choose, the general odds are the same coz the way theyre put its either: more damage but slow firing OR less damage but rapit firing...so if you're accurate ,the odds of kiling an enemy is the same.- The way the story evolves, there's little chance there will be a Mass Effect 4.

They make good, reliable products that contain many features that other products don't have. This mouse is great for gaming and design. The side keys make for a huge variety of shortcut keys (12 keys). There is also 2 buttons next to the scroll wheel which are great for a DPI switcher or &#34;forward&#34; and &#34;back&#34; buttons. The mouse has RGB LEDs, which mean that it can make any color (including white/gray). By default the mouse is set for a rotation fade between every color in the spectum, with the exception of white and the grayscale. I also love the charger, which is also the receiver. You also have the option to switch between wired and wireless through the receiver/charger by swapping the cable. Which means that you do get an interrupted connection for a few seconds, but it doesn't take any longer to reconnect. It also comes with 3 interchangeable grips, which will suit just about everybody's needs. Once again I also love the software...the possibilities are endless.

11455,222300,A3VONQL7YW8UPM,B00CMQTVUA,Geoff Ables,"[13, 19]","We pre-ordered the Day One Xbox One from Microsoft.  I'm glad to say that we have not experienced the disk loading/playing issues that so many others are reporting.  As a frame of reference: I'm a regular user of Microsoft devices (Windows Phone, Surface tablet, Xbox 360 and now Xbox One) - so in general I like what Microsoft has to offer.  I'm also a reasonably technical guy and don't generally have much problem figuring out technology.With all of that said, I can only recommend the Xbox One for a small group of individuals at this time.One other item to note: This is not intended to compare the Xbox One to the PS4.  My guess is that the Xbox One would have roughly the same pros/cons as the PS4.  This is mostly written for those who already have a game console (particularly an Xbox 360 - but really any other console that they're happy with) and are wondering if the time is right to purchase an Xbox One.BOTTOM LINE:* If you are an avid gamer, and one or more of the very small collection of games available on the Xbox One today is something that you enjoy - then I'd recommend going ahead and purchasing this.  My understanding is that this may be particularly true for individuals who enjoy online multiplayer games.* For anyone else, you'll probably be happier sticking with your existing game console for another 6-12 months before making the leap.* If you're not a gamer, and you already have Apple products (PC, iPhone, iPad) then I think you would be far happier with an AppleTV than an Xbox One at this time.WHY DO I SAY THAT?  Glad you asked...GAMES IN GENERAL: For me, the console is still mostly about the games.  And the Xbox One  has very few of them available.  Your old Xbox 360 games won't upgrade (I'm not complaining that the old games won't upgrade, and understand why) and with only 6-12 games of any quality out there for Xbox One, the selection is frustratingly limited right now.  In my opinion there are about a half-dozen really good games that take advantage of what the Xbox One offers.  But these only cover a few very specific categories.  If you're not into shooters, race car or sports games, or if you want more than 1 or 2 options in each of these categories - then you're going to be frustrated.FAMILY/KINECT GAMES: Me?  I like strategic games (i.e. Civilization), open world games (i.e. Skyrim), block games (i.e. Minecraft), platformers (i.e. Crash Bandicoot was one that I'd liked) and, yes, the occasional shooter (i.e. Call of Duty, Halo).  As a family, we really like some of the family-oriented Kinect games (i.e. the Kinect-based sports titles).  Of all of the aforementioned categories, there is really only one game (in my opinion) of any quality on the Xbox One that fits one of those descriptions (Call of Duty: Ghosts).  And there is not a single Kinect game available yet that approaches the quality of the Kinect games available for the Xbox 360.OTHER APPS: Aside from the games, the Xbox One does offer some other compelling features - one of which is the ability to add apps to it (much as you can to a phone, iPad or Windows 8 PC).* We've actually found the Skype app to be a really nice app to have on our Xbox.  On Christmas day, we all sat in front of the TV and Skyped the rest of our family in India, California, DC and Tulsa.  If you Skype a lot and you'd like to do it with a large group sitting in front of your TV, then you may find this a compelling reason to buy.* There are a variety of other video playing apps for the device.  As an Amazon Prime member, I really like the fact that I can get to my Amazon Prime videos (no more hooking my Kindle up to my TV to watch these shows).  We're also Netflix members and can get to the Netflix videos as well.  Microsoft has their own video store that has a pretty good selection too.  We're not members of others, but there are options for Hulu, Verizon Fios and maybe some other video apps.* Snapping the NFL app up next to a football game was cool for about 15 minutes.  But it doesn't really provide any good info and was too complex for anyone in the family except for me.* None of these other apps, however, would be reason enough for me to recommend an Xbox One (assuming you have another device that already gives you access to these items - as we do).  It's convenient to have them all in one place, but not a compelling enough reason to buy this unit yet.BUGS / PERFOMANCE: There are still a lot of things about my Xbox that don't seem quite ready for prime time...* Other than games, one of the main reasons I was excited to get our Xbox One was the promise of all of our Microsoft devices working together to easily share music, video and photos.  While there has been an improvement, it is still not nearly where our AppleTV was about 5 years ago.  You can't (from what I can tell), select music, pictures or videos on your other device and &#34;send them&#34; to the Xbox One.* Sharing your collection across devices is possible, but it is &#34;hobbled&#34;.  For example, I have an Xbox music account.  When I'm logged into the Xbox using my Microsoft account, I can select all of the music that I want.  It's very nice because I can even hand-pick music that I want to play from Microsoft's library - and I don't have to pay for it (other than the monthly fee for my Xbox Music account).  However, if anyone else in my family is logged into the Xbox One as themselves, they don't have access to my music library.  They can manually login as me - but then, if I'm listening to my music on another device, it will only allow it to stream to one of the two devices at a time.  Because we could all easily just stream music, pics and video straight from our other Apple devices to our AppleTV (without having to go through a sync process and/or have a paid monthly account), we never experienced this problem with the AppleTV.- Existing music playlists don't sync quickly across devices as one would expect.  When I first create a playlist, it seems to propagate across all my devices fairly quickly.  But when I make a change to a list on one device (i.e. my Surface tablet), I waited days for it to show up on my Xbox One before finally giving up and just creating a new playlist that then synced right away.  I didn't see options for manually telling the Xbox One to sync an existing playlist.- Voice recognition leaves a LOT to be desired.  Maybe that's because I need to give it more time to &#34;train&#34; to recognize my voice.  Or maybe it requires our house to be quiet (our house is rarely quiet, with dishwashers, washing/drying machines and plenty of conversation all within earshot of the Xbox).  Many times I have to repeat the same command 2 or 3 times.  I've pretty much given up on bothering to use the voice recognition.- The same seems to largely be the same for hand gestures.  This is improved over the Xbox 360 but, in most cases, I find it easier to just use the control.- The TV app promises to eliminate the need for other remote controls.  You can plug your TV receiver (i.e. Cable TV, Satellite, etc) directly into the Xbox and train it to know what is plugged in.  There is a very cool &#34;One Guide&#34; that shows you available programming and let's you find what you want to watch - and it remembers favorites for you.  On the other hand, the OneGuide doesn't seems any easier to navigate than our regular SatTV guide, and you cannot yet give it voice commands like &#34;Show Me What Football Games are Playing&#34; or &#34;Watch Carolina Panthers&#34; - instead, it has to be something specific like &#34;Watch ESPN 2&#34; (so I am stuck navigating through all the channels to find the programming I want still).  The biggest problem, however, is that the TV app is buggy.  More than once I've tried to start it, and it has failed. Since our SatTV is now routed through our Xbox, we can't watch TV at all in these situations!  I've finally thrown up my hands and disconnected the SatTV from the Xbox and plugged it directly into our TV.  So the TV app is now useless.- The Xbox allows you to program it to power on/off all your related devices when the Xbox.  I did this when I first set it up.  It worked fairly well, but sometimes it would not work with one or more of the devices (a relatively small annoyance).  I moved the Kinect to the top of the TV and now it doesn't work on any of the other devices at all.  The best I can tell, it issues remote control orders from the Kinect and, with that device now on top of the TV, it may not have line of sight ability to access those other devices.  When we initially relocated the Kinect, we went to the Xbox settings menu and re-synced the Kinect to the room - but that had no impact on the remote controls.  So we're back to using all of our remote controls as we normally did.- Other apps seem to occasionally time out. For example, I was in the Xbox Store app and tried to open one of the games to see the description, and it locked up - I tried again and it did the same thing (but when attempting to open other game descriptions it worked fine).  As another example, I played a DVD one night; the next night we powered the Xbox on, took the first DVD out and inserted another - and it continued showing us a still shot of the first DVD until we completely powered down and restarted the device.- Microsoft has an app called Xbox One Smart Glass that enriches the Xbox experience on your Windows 8 PC/tablet or on  your Windows Phone.  This sometimes works, but I've experienced a number of &#34;can't access our Xbox right now&#34; messages on it.SUMMING IT ALL UP:The Xbox One is much too buggy (and/or difficult to use) right now to make some of the exciting new features worthwhile, and the lack of games also makes it a less compelling option as an entertainment device.  The good news is that Microsoft will (hopefully) send out software patches that address most of the worst bugs and new games will be released.  Based on the game release schedule, it looks to me like it will be at least 6 months - and perhaps 12 months - before there is a diverse range of quality games available for this device.  If Microsoft chooses to &#34;port&#34; about 12 of the better Xbox 360 games over quickly, then it would make this device much more compelling sooner.I'll plan to update this review and my rating in the coming months.

5648,127765,A1S9IXEKR89C2A,B002ATYQLS,"MomAdvice ""Amy Allen Clark""","[15, 17]","I wanted to get my son's thoughts on this game for nearly 2 weeks now but he's been so busy playing it, I haven't been able to get a good overview from him until now. I shouldn't be surprised. It combines his favorite thing in the world, dinosaurs, with something he does every day with his sister... fighting.Fossil Fighters is a new game for the DS where you can pretty much guess what it entails from the title. You play a boy (what? no girls?) who comes to an island to hunt for fossils which will turn into battle-ready dinosaurs, ready to tear your opponents dinos apart. Well, its not quite that exciting, but I'm getting ahead of myself.The gameplay consists of 4 main elements: the story, hunting for fossils, cleaning the fossils, and fighting. The story helps move things along and does a good job of introducing the other parts of the game as you come to them. New areas of the game open up as you progress allow you to explore and find new fossils. The fossil finding is dead simple. You have a radar that tells you where they are around you and you dig them up. The excitement is in finding new fossils that give you a new dinosaur makes existing ones more powerful.My favorite part of the game is the cleaning. If you have kids who have always wanted to be paleontologists or archeologists, they'd love this. You have to chip away at the rock using a hammer and drill to uncover the bone within. The challenge is you must do this without damaging the fossil as well as complete the task within a set time limit. The less damage you do to the fossil, the more powerful your resulting dinosaur will be. This can be both rewarding and frustrating. Some rocks already have parts of the fossil showing, so you must be more careful in those areas. Some rocks resemble swiss cheese making the cleaning process feel like surgery. The DS is perfect for this task with the touchscreen. To top it off, your drill creates dust making it difficult to see what you're doing so you blow on your DS to remove the dust making it great fun.That brings us to the fighting. Battles crop up in many different ways, but most are when you dig something up and another fighter pops out of nowhere claiming it to be theirs. You break out your pack of dinos and take turns unleashing a variety of moves. There is actually a good amount of strategy involved as different types of dinos are strong or weak against other types. This affects which ones you bring with you to battle (you can only choose 3). Also, one of these does the main fighting at a time while the others serve supporting roles. If you win, your dinos get a little stronger. If you lose, you don't lose your fossils or any similar dire consequences with lowers the frustration factor for kids. You simple end up back in town and you try the same thing again.The downside of this game is that for being named after fighting, the fighting doesn't seem to be the best part. The fights are repetitive and very easy for most of the game. It's fun to try out new dinosaurs when you get them, but it's the same routine over and over. Many times, the fighting gets in the way of the fun, which is a shame. The good thing is that the rest of the game is quite satisfying and its certainly not a game they will finish in a few days. There's plenty of entertainment for the kids in this one.",4,Dinosaurs + Fighting= Awesome Boy Game,1251936000,"09 3, 2009"

I was hooked even though frustrated by unpredictable control of Lara's jumps and climbing abilities.  Well, at least the problem of walking off ledges was addressed by a special key.

I did not expect to get more than half way through the game, however, and hit a fatal glitch that stopped me in my tracks. A  bit of bad luck.

I was quite curious what Slightly Mad Studios was going to do for the franchise, and to be certain I do not regret my purchase at all. In fact, after earning the platinum in this game I went back and am playing it again, and I find it is one of my favorite racing sims to be honest. The Corners Mastered idea (which you can find explanations of elsewhere) is really neat and something I enjoy immensely - what a neat idea, particularly for giving another element of progress and goals to the game, something that quite honestly a racing game probably can use. I used to be a huge Forza junkie back in the Xbox days and honestly have been disappointed by every iteration after the original game. Not to delve to heavily into that here because it's not quite relevant, but I found that those games feel just like rehashes of the original. Shift feels fresh, fun; yeah its physics can occasionally be wonky and ""bouncy"" (you'll see what I mean if you play enough) but I think the game offers enough of its own twist to be quite distinct from any of the other sim franchises and that in itself is cool.The bodykits are cool, the ""works"" idea is cool enough and allows the more ""tuner""-y cars to compete on the level of the supercars, and in general the game just looks good. Some of the challenges are quite difficult, but getting the platinum wasn't as frustrating as I've seen it be in other games, and the way trophies are awarded for general number of badge completions is great because you can win it all without having to play online; or if you fancy you can earn the online ones and not necessarily have to complete all the more difficult challenges. Which ones are most difficult really depends on the way you drive and play the game, which is another aspect of this game that I think is great.Give it a try if you like racing sims; it's definitely worth the money.",5,"Racing sim, or arcade game?

6046,54662,A2EKSIM53L1SP5,B00081UR7C,Jonathan Walters,"[3, 3]","Knights of Honor (KoH) is a combination turn-based/real-time strategy game by European developer Black Sea Studios. With that in mind, the game is quite a departure from the `western' strategy titles out there, but in the case of KoH this is certainly one of the game's strengths.KoH lets players choose an empire, and manage it through one of three spans of time ranging from the early to the late medieval periods. The game is unique in that play centers around the player's `court', which is composed of a limited number of slots that can be filled with different types of knights. What knights you choose largely depends on your play style, but includes types such as marshals that can lead armies, merchants that can generate trade income, or clerics that can convert populations to your religion.Gameplay is paced slowly, and though at first it would seem like a design flaw this turns out to be one of KoH's strengths, forcing players to consider options other than the sword exclusively. This makes diplomacy and trade much more rewarding, and serves to really enhance gameplay in the long run.On the sound side, the music, voice acting and sound effects are all top not, and serve to immerse you into the game's world well. The graphics are also great considering they are 2D, which do the job nicely without having a full blown resource-intensive 3D engine to bother with. Strategy gamers will appreciate this, as it allows the game to be run on something like an economy laptop well.On the negative side, the economic model and combat systems are quite simplistic and feel very rushed or incomplete. Furthermore, there seem to be mary exploitable flaws in the AI which in the end serve to ensure that players of KoH will eventually look in other directions for more of a challenge. But this issue sheds light on a larger problem for KoH:Whereas developers such as Stardock are pioneers in giving gamers a more direct say in the developmental direction of games and in the longterm support of their games through patches and enhancements, Black Sea Studios seems to have abandoned support of KoH prematurely, despite the protests and inquiries of it's customers. Such a lack of support says much of the company, but fortunately the game itself is a great one as-is, despite the flaws.My Review:Pros: Well-rounded gameplay and pace, fun and effective diplomacy model (if at times erratic on the AI's part) , good graphics quality and animations, fun battle system, court concept of limited options for knights.Cons: Simplistic gameplay limits replayability in the long run, issues with AI, dismal developer support.Summary: Although not quite a classic, KoH is certainly one of the best titles in it's genre and deserves a look for those not yet familiar with it. For those seeking something more difficult or flashy, look at the Total War series.",3,"Great addition the genre, albeit with flaws.",1149552000,"06 6, 2006"

The tone of the game, while clearly modeled after the original ""Super Mario Bros."" for the NES, has a much different feel to it than [any other Mario time] Mario game.  That is because Shigeru Miyamoto did not produce the game; instead, his mentor, Gunpei Yokoi, produced and directed the title.Yokoi, who was killed in a car accident in 1997 in Japan, was Miyamoto's mentor.  It was because of Yokoi that Miyamoto's game ""Donkey Kong"" came before the leaders of Nintendo at the time.  Yokoi came up with the Game & Watch series, ""Kid Icarus"" and ""Metroid"" for the NES, and the Gameboy.  (A ""Metroid"" enemy even makes a cameo appearance in ""Super Mario Land"").The game features elements not seen before (or since) in the Mario series, including Egyptian themed bosses (although the Egypt theme is common in Mario, the bosses from SML are never heard of again, just like SMB2), space aliens, an apparent unending fascination with Easter Island and its Moi heads, and even two Shooting levels.  Although Miyamato revealed in an ""Iwata Asks"" interview that the original ""Super Mario Bros."" was going to have shooting levels, and the coin heavens are left over fragments of that idea (along with Mario having a gun), this idea was never implemented in the core series with the sole exception of ""Super Mario Land"".I grew up with Mario, like most other gamers. With only two exceptions, I have played every Mario title at launch or shortly thereafter, from the original 1985 ""Super Mario Bros"" all the way down to ""New Super Mario Bros. 2"" (yes I'm old). Obviously being American we didn't get ""Lost Levels"" until ""Super Mario All-Stars"", but I got the SNES version when it was released back in '93 and have played through ""Lost Levels"" so many times over the years I've more than made up for not getting it back in 1986.Anyway, the two I missed? ""Super Mario Land"" for the Gameboy (which I did play very briefly back when it first came out, but I never had it; we went with ""Super Mario Land 2"" instead when I did get a Gameboy) and ""Super Mario Sunshine"".  The very few times that I did play the game on the original Gameboy back in 1989 or the very early 1990s, I do remember getting as far as the first boss, which means I was a fourth of the way done.Being the Mario fan that I am, I did play through ""Super Mario Land"" on emulator a couple of years back, beating  the game over two decades after it was first released. [Before I really played the game I remember getting as far as the first boss, which means I was a fourth of the way done].  Since then, I purchased the title on the 3DS Virtual Console (love those restore points!)So my thoughts on the game?  Well, of all the Mario games, this is easily the most insubstantial title in the entire franchise of proper ""Super Mario"" games (I am not including spin-offs and subseries).  ""Super Mario Land"" was a launch title for the Gameboy, and boy does it show.  The majority of the sprites are small, including Mario himself.  Being monochrome, it can be hard to see what is going on given how small the sprites are as well as how small the screen is. The game is SHORT - only twelve levels.  Each level has about a 400 second time limit, so to do a full run through of the game, even dragging your feet, will not net you much gameplay in terms of time.Due to Miyamoto's lack of involvement, the setting and overall enemy roster feels quite different than other Mario titles.  There are octupuses, jumping flowers that shoot fire (reminds of me of Panser from ""Super Mario Bros. 2"", Gaos (they resemble Egyptian sphinxes), robots (!!), Totais (running Easter Island Moai  heads), Pionpis (jumping men who shoot at Mari in the last world) and Yurarin Boos, who are fire-breathing seahorses.  The last two are the most interesting, as they are heavily reminesnt of ""Metroid"".  The Pionpis reminds me of Samus Aran's female sprite when the JUSTIN BAILEY code is entered, and the Yurarin Boos are identical to the seahorses (in terms of game play and species type, though the sprites differ somewhat) in ""Metroid"" as well.The game is set in Sarasaland, comprised of four kingdoms, Birabuto, Muda, Easton and Chai.  Suddenly an evil space alien named Tatanga appears, kidnaps Princess Daisy (who debuts in this game), and it is up to Mario to rescue the Princess (but it's not Princess Peach at least).Probably my biggest complaint about the game, besides the short length, is the looseness in the controls.  I don't know if this holds true for the original Gameboy (I suspect it does), but playing on the 3DS, I found Mario often times going slightly further than I wanted, [or not far enough].  I've never hard this problem with the other Mario games.  There is also some weird hit detection issues going on.  I was playing 4-2, jumped up on a pipe with a pirana plant and definitely hit the plant, and Mario did not lose his power up.  I've seen this happen multiple times.The loose play control further exacerbates another issue: no saving.  If you run out of lives (unless you're on 4-3, the very last world), you have to start all over which can be frustrating.  If you die on the last level you do get two continues.  Often times due to the loose play control I would slightly overshoot where I was jumping and Mario would plummet to his death.  Now, to be fair, to expect such a short game all the way back in 1989 to having saving is ridiculous, but none the less the criticism holds that there is some inherent frustration having to start all the way over.  Nintendo could have at least provided continues (a more realistic option for a game of this age).  .The game is clearly modelled on the original ""Super Mario Bros."", although with some noticable differences.  First, the music itself is unlike anything else in the series, and is one of the strongest assests the game offers.  Just like the first game, you can't go back to the left; the screen only scrolls right.  Mario's sprite is also modelled on his sprite from the NES title.The power ups are pretty weak.  There are exactly three: the Super mushroom, the Super Ball, and an invincibility star.  The Super Mushroom will make Mario big.  The Super Ball (this game's idiotic version of the Fire Flower) allows Mario to shoot projectiles.  However, the key difference between the fireflower and the super ball is that when you shoot the Super Ball, the ball will bounce off the flower floor and go up until it hits another surface.  So on levels that are pretty open, you shoot the Super Ball, it hits the ground right in front of Mario, and then shoots straight up into the sky, never to be seen again, rendering this power up effectively useless unless the enemies are right up by you, creating a bigger margin for error.  If you are in a more enclosed space, the ball will bounce around against the various surfaces until it either hits an enemy or times out.  Unfortunately you can only shoot one at a time, so if you have one bouncing around and it's not connecting with an enemy, you have to either go on or wait and try shooting whatever your aiming for after the first ball disappears.Like the other Mario titles, ""Super Mario Land"" would prove to be a massive hit, selling over eighteen million copies in its initial run.  What's depressing to me is that ""Super Mario Land"" actually outsold the far superior ""Super Mario Bros. 3"".  Note: that does not count the rereleases and Virtual Console sales, only the intial NES release vs. the Gameboy release.For a game of its time, the title is pretty fun.  But of all the games in the core ""Super Mario"" series, this is easily the least substantial title, due to its brevity, the loose play controls, and the overall disconnection from the rest of the series.  The games sequel, ""Super Mario Land 2: Six Golden Coins"", is infinitely better, with bigger sprites, more engaging gameplay, and a much longer gametime.  The music though from SML is, admittedly, fantastic and is probably its strongest point.Mario's first portable adventure, though fun while it lasts (which isn't long), is the weakest entry in the ""Super Mario"" franchise.

I am happy to say my dance mat works 100% with this device. I have a 64 bit windows 7 PC. Also my wireless logitech controller works perfectlySo why did I only give it 2 stars if it works perfectly with my mat and wireless controller?Well it doesn't work with my sony PS2 controllers. I have four sony PS2 controllers and none work fully with this device. I have one controller that came with my slim PS2, two controllers that came with my fat ps2, and one controller that I bought and none of them work fully. The R1 and R2 are not recognized at all and the up directional pad doesn't work on two of the controllers.Also there is major problem with the drivers. The company that made this doesn't exist anymore. So there really aren't any drivers specifically made for anything beyond windows XP. If you want to find the latest drivers do a google search for dilong 203 drivers but don't use them. Basically I found a guy on stepmania web site that had the drivers up on file hosting site. What happen after installing these drivers was all my fonts got messed up. I'm guessing the drivers were for a Chinese OS. Basically I couldn't read anything on my PC. All texts under my incons were foreign symbols. All text in all texts were foreign symbols. I had to pull out my nexus 7 to search the web for a fix. Basically I ended up using my windows 7 install disc to repair my pc. If you have a system that had windows pre installed and don't have win7 disc you would be in horrible trouble if you didn't make a backup or rescue disc. Before I found a fix I was getting ready to reinstall windows 7.Now there may be english drivers that wont mess up your pc but it isn't worth the risk looking for them if you ask me. Anyway the basic drivers that come on the disc will let you use a wireless logitech PS2 controller and a redoctane dance mat.  I also tried a guitar that almost worked fully. The only thing that didn't work was the whammy bar.So if you buy this for mat or wireless ps2 controller make sure to backup the drivers on the disc.  Personally I think you might be better off getting one that is known to work with windows 7 and one that is made by a company that is still in business.Also note i did try restarting my computer and installing the drivers in windows xp compatibility mode to get the ps2 controllers to work. No dice.Edit: 27-FEB-13Reducing score to a 1.  I can not hit 2 directions at the same time on my dance mat which now makes this completely useless for me.

It was becoming a hassle to keep track of which of us got which memory card (we have two Nykos), so I bought the 64mb version of this card (which Amazon doesn't seem to have here) to put everything worth backing up on one card. I have the Max, my brother has the Nyko cards.I had no problem at all copying the files from the Nykos to the Max, nor have I had any problem with loading files from the Max. The problem comes in with trying to save. I tried to update my We Love Katamari save file, and it no longer lets me. If I save to a different file, it still fails. I'm currently leaving the system on until I can get to GameStop tomorrow to get a replacement for the Max.Since I bought a 64mb card, it's not even near full capacity yet. It's ended up being a waste of money, as I could have saved everything to Nykos. At least those work--I've never had a problem with either Nyko memory card.In a nutshell: It's all right if all you want to do is backup your files, but it seems that once the memory gets past a certain point, saving becomes useless. You're better off with a Sony or a Nyko, even if they aren't as large. Even the 16mb version of this card isn't worth it if you only have full access to your files up to 10mb.",2,Can no longer be saved to.,1141689600,"03 7, 2006"

I played this game for about 3 weeks straight for an 1 1/2 hours 3 times a week.  Most of the exercises are recognized by kinect and are really good, but a few like the cross ski are completely broken in that no matter how you match the instructor it never recognizes you doing the exercise right - this means you cant progress any further in the game.  I think another one was the side/back lunges that don't pickup right.So this leads to the problem, I'm on the advanced cardio and now am stuck because no matter how hard I try to mimic the cross ski it always gives me a 0% score so I cant ever pass that stage, so here I am continually doing the cross ski and power jog exercises over and over and can't continue on to any other exercise.  This just makes the game boring, I had to reset the save profile to start over again but within 3 exercise sessions I'm back to square one.Overall it really does provide a decent workout until you run into problems with exercises not picking up your movements right.The gym games and fitness classes seem useless as they dont keep your heart rate up and are very short.This game if baked for another few months in development would have really helped it.I do give it credit that you can navigate the game fully with your hands and do not need a controller ever.

Dawn of Fate tells the story of the events leading up to Kyle Resse's eventful trip back to the past to save Sarah Connor and destroy the CSM-101 Terminator sent to kill her and prevent John Connor from being born. The game is built around the standard premise of killing terminators, collecting technology for upgrades and of course, the survival of all mankind against the evil and monolithic, Skynet. You get to meet General Connor, Justin Perry and Catherine Luna- friends and comrades of Kyle's and you switch characters between missions.It's odd that they managed to capture the look of post Judgment Day Earth, the battlefields and ruined cities perfectly. Everything Skynet had- all the vehicles- the H/K tanks and aerial units are all there in gleaming chrome, but that's all they captured. The sounds are all wrong. The brilliant purple plasma guns sound like typical game fair and don't have their deep, resonant stutter from the movies. Even the H/Ks don't sound quite right. It's like whichever studio owns the copyright approved using the appearance of everything, but said they couldn't use the sound effects. Either than or the developers decided to do their own. Bad mistake. Another flaw is that the Tech/Com soldiers and their weapons aren't really representative of the movies, either.All I can say about the character models is BAD. Kyle Reese looks like Christopher Walken did as the Hessian in Sleepy Hollow, stupid hair and all. Justin Perry looks like he was carved out of stone and I won't go into how unfeminine Luna looks. Connor is probably the best rendered of the lot.Mission play is broken up into 3rd person play, starting with protecting Connor from an terminator infiltration attack, destroying Tech/Com's computers and blowing up an H/K tank that has rolled into the top floor of the resistance's hideout. In that mission you have to protect a demolitions expert as he plants explosive charges in the massive hotel base, is a royal pain, because he does nothing to defend himself. Instead, he stands there passively getting blasted by terminators while you rush around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to kill them before they grease him. Later missions involve a secondary story that the programmers must have felt was pretty clever. They're wrong. As well you must prevent Skynet from steeling all the platinum from a Federal Reserve bank.Apparently Skynet has just perfected the CSM-101 series infiltrators, but they have also been capturing normal humans and modifying them cybernetic mind control devices. One of these, Alexander Stone, blames Kyle for the death of his brother Gabriel and so has turned traitor, joining forces with Skynet in order to seek revenge. It is he the player must track down because he has stolen Connor's battle plans for an assault against Skynet's main base at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado. But while you get the plans back, you can never actually kill Stone. I'm not entirely sure why Skynet would create these hybrids- dressed as they are in black and red leather with cybernetic implants visible on them, it's not like they can blend in like the infiltrator terminators do.Finally it's the main assault on Cheyenne Mountain and you fight your way into the very core of the enemy's main base- blowing up everything in site. The hardest part being the attack on the central computer AI- the heart of Skynet which is apparently SO powerful that it is capable of mind control, a process that takes a few minutes while you work feverishly to cut off the computer's power source before it melts your guy's brain, thus ending the game.So it's a pretty standard story line, except for the silliness of the hybrid part. There are plenty of weapons- grenades, rockets, plasma guns, machine guns, EMP weapons that stun robots for a few seconds- pretty basic stuff. The game offers a first person view, but as with any first-person console game, control is terrible and you're better off not using it except to look around at the scenery. One interesting function is Adrenaline- a function that makes you shoot faster and more accurately which enables you to take down baddies quicker than usual. It doesn't last long so it's best used wisely. Another problem is the Dino Crisis effect- opening doors just to get to another small area to open another door in order to get to another small area and, you guessed it, open another door. It gets old very fast.While there are good concepts here, some nice graphics, the game almost seems crippled in places. Heck, you can't even walk off a ledge and kill yourself because the game won't allow it. But for the most part it seems to be a half-baked attempt to tell the same story that Bethesda Software did a decade ago with `Terminator: 2029', a somewhat more entertaining game, if graphically inferior. Dawn of Fate manages to tell a fair story with repetitive game play- go there, do that, kill this- if you've played Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you'll know what to expect. I'd be interested to see the Xbox version just to check if it at least has better graphics.",2,"Good concept, lousy execution",1055203200,"06 10, 2003"

Face it, the Rome levels are just not that exciting. I played and beat levels 1 & 2, then attempted 3, unfortunatly, it took me 2 weeks to figure out how to beat level 3, it was WAY too hard. And that's just one of the many things that make TR Chronicles fall short of being one of the best in the series. OK, so there's alot of pros, Lara can now interact more with the characters around her (instead of just shooting a weapon, she can now bash people over the head with crowbars & stuff), she can now open and search file cabinets for various items, and she can kick down doors (which she could do in TR Last Revelations but it's still a cool move). In addition to new moves, there are 4 massive adventures to be explored. But as with all pros, there must be cons, and unfortunatly, the cons are major. My first complaint is puzzles (particulary timed-puzzles) being WAY too hard. I couldn't complete level 3 in Rome (Colessium) for 2 weeks because of the timed-puzzle in the middle of it, i almost tried to give up on the game in all, but after i beat the Colessium, i found it not so hard. In adventure 2, which takes place on a Russian Submarine (personally my favorite adventure of the game), Lara must get onto the sub, dive under the sea, and collect the Sphere Of Destiny (i think that's what its called). Not only is the storyline fun, but you have alot of fun exploring the subs many levels and areas, but once again, a con came into play. I found the Deep Sea Dive level incredibly difficult, and it took me awhile to collect the Sphere and escape back to the sub. Adventure 3, takes place on a haunted island in Ireland, i really just didn't like this area, not only is it boring, but it is so dark its hard to see what your doing. Finally, Adventure 4, which takes place in the VCI Headquarters, is a partly fun adventure. But even with its cool graphical images of a high-tech city, its really difficult to complete the 3 levels involved (espicially since you on have the HK weapon). On level 1 of VCI, i found it difficult to get the Iris at the end, but luckily, i found a cheat (not too much of a cheat) where you can press the button, sideflip left, flip backwards, then press and crawl like your crawling off a ledge, you will go through the glass!! It took me awhile, but after that helpful little clue, i completed level 1 of VCI. Level 2 of VCI, Escape With The Iris, is incredibly difficult (espicially since you have no weapons), i found all the portions with the elevator shafts and that slide where you half to jump and swing off two poles very difficult, i could barely complete this level. And the final level, Red Alert!, it is almost IMPOSSIBLE to complete shooting range #2, it took me 45 to 50 times to complete this one obstacle. Pretty much, i found TR Chronicles a cool game graphics wise, but gameplay is very difficult and sometimes annoying, if you want an all-out fun TR game that still has cool graphics, check out TR2 or TR3, just remember this one is just a sample of what will be on TR6: THE ANGEL OF DARKNESS for the PS2 & PC, coming soon!",3,"Great graphics, poor gameplay...",1052956800,"05 15, 2003"

And the changing attacks/spells for weapons was pleasant. Like if you have a staff you might have 2 or 3 AOE spells. You switch to a one hand dagger and it would be mostly single target attacks/spells. The quest system is more realistic in my opinion.

I once thought Civilization III and Medal of Honor were bad, but Star Wars - An Empire Divided, could end a marraige or turn you into a hermit (at least in real life, plenty of friends can be made in-game).  This game is AWESOME!I've never seen a game this complex and engrossing.  To start, you customize the character you want from one of six species, then modify the 3-D model's body, face, and features.  You choose from one of five novice professions, which can branch to like 20 elite professions.  For example, if you want to be an architect, you start as an artisan, concentrate on the homebuilding tree, gain experience, then become a novice architect and go from there.  This is what originally interested me in the game, since I've never really liked fantasy.  But the chance to become a medic, architect, or musician, instead of just a swordsman dwarf or archer elf, seemed interesting.  Indeed, it has been.The player economy seems to work very well.  Because one person cannot be a master in more than two fields at once, and you can't have more than one player per server (each server is a galaxy), players cannot be self-sufficient.  They have to buy and sell to get what they need.  And with the diversity of demands, everything from tailors needing hide, to architects needing metal, to pistoliers needing more advanced firearms, the economy is quite vibrant.The only complaints I have about the game are the server down-time and bugs.  Yes, they could have waited in Beta more, but the more players they have reporting bugs the more errors they can find.  In a game this wildly complex there will likely always be a bug or two.  Like books, software isn't necessarily completed, it's simply released.  However, instead of beta-testing for another 6 months, I'm glad they released the game now.  It's worth playing, there's a bug report function in the game, and server downtimes are announced on the Star Wars Galaxies site.  Also, your first month with the game is free to give you time to determine whether or not you like it.There are lots of great things about this game, but one of the most interesting is the fact that you're dealing with other people, and you can make friends through this game.  That, and that the escalations your characters go through while gaining experience are really neat.  While a lot of players are upset that they aren't an uber-character straight out of the box, people who stick with the game grow attached to it because they make characters very strong.  It's rewarding to come across a newbie being chewed to death by kreetles (large Tattooine insects), flailing for life, and you easily destroy all the bugs and their lair in six shots because you've mastered the Pistolieer profession.The animated battles in this game are great.  The characters dodge, roll, blast, shoot from under the belt, dive and shoot, trade swords, or parry pike thrusts.  There's even an unarmed martial art in this game.I've had the game a month now, and no one I know of has become a Jedi or opened a force-sensitive slot.  Some fanboys seem upset about this.  Well, just because it takes months to even discover how to become a Jedi, and there's no guarantee you'll unlock your character's force slot, doesn't mean the game is bad.  On the other hand, if there's a Jedi in a galaxy, that player's a legend.  This stands up with the esteem of Jedis in the movies.  They're rare, legendary, and powerful.  If you want to be an insta-Jedi you can always pick up Knights of the Old Republic.Another thing about this game that's really cool are the player cities.  I'm in one now, and it's basically all friends who play at the same time of day and have professions that compliment one another.  We have a PA hall at the end of the street, then a street full of player houses, stores, etc.  There are constant block parties and you never have to scrounge and scrape to get a hunting party going.  We have doctors and entertainers in the PA hall, so if you come back from a hunt or mission or raid, the doctors and dancers and musicians heal you, you give them a slice of the mission reward, and everyone's happy.  The artisans in our guild (tailor, armorer, weaponsmith, architect) give us discounts, since I supply materials, and money-trading is done within the guild in case someone needs to buy something big like a factory or whatever.The game can be disheartening if you're just starting out.  It's hard to find your niche in the economy, and it takes time to gain experience.  But, so what?  It imitates life.  And if it takes you a month or two to gain an elite profession, just think how long it takes in real life.  And in the meantime, you come across other people with your level of talent and you bond with them.  Or, if you're not socially inclined, you can just be a lone wolf and take destroy missions for money.Overall, it's a very cool game.  There have been a couple development bumps along the way, but if your computer is a steady mount, this game will go nicely.  Also, the bugs and servers have improved steadily in the past month.  There's a lot more I'd like to say about how fun this game is, but the best thing I can say is go buy it.Also, if you get the collector's edition, your character starts off with sunglasses, which aren't available or tradeable.  Definitely look kinda leet and cool with those.  Wish I'd bought 'em!-- JJ Timmins",5,AWESOME GAME!  Whiners be gone.,1059004800,"07 24, 2003"

The PS1 enries were really enjoyable for all ages and helped define my childhood and preteen years.  However, as usual, when a franchise is given over to different companies, there is always a dip in quality and this is a prime example of a game that the developers didn't have that much time to work on.  This is the same case as the first Rocky game for the same console generation along with Sonic 2006, Tomb Raider: The Angels of Darkness, & the NES version of Action 52, and it, beyond any doubt, shows.  Here are the aspects were I feel this game could have improved on had the developers been given more time to refine it.Graphics:  I know this is more like a personal preference thing and it matters the least, but to quote the Angry Video Game Nerd to some degree on the transition to 128 bits, the graphics are even cheesier and more cartoonish, but not the worst I have seen.  In contrast, take a look at the original PS1 trilogy; 96 bits less but 100x more appealing to the eye.Controls and Gameplay:  I admit that it is nice that Spyro has virtually the same moves as its predecessors with a few new ones such as wing shields and different breath abilities and it isn't the worst controls I have experienced, but it feels a little bit sluggish while the original PS1 games feel more fluent.  Plus, using the bubble breath to get the dragonflies is more tedious than using your ice breath to get fireflies in Season of Flame.Load Times (PS2):  Just like Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, the load times are pretty long considering that they were released when the PS2 was in its earliest years.  At least the Gamecube version and the Greatest Hits revision sped up the load times though maybe increasing the disc speed on the PS2 may help but I haven't tried it yet on this game.More Levels and Worlds:  They planned on having more stages and worlds for Spyro to traverse in and retrieve the dragonflies but they really had to cut corners due to a very short amount of time to make this game.  Because of this, it is really short and only worth it for a rental out of curiosity.Glitches:  As you guys probably know, every game has glitches, no matter what.  Sometimes, people like finding glitches because of what the Nerd pointed out in his Game Glitches video, such as finding errors that the developers missed or exploring outside the rules.  However, it becomes a problem if the glitches get in the way of the gameplay and not activate upon command, which is what the PS2 version suffers from.  For example, the Cloud 9 stage crashes and the Jurassic Jungle layout may disappear, just to name a few.  At least the Gamecube version fixed the fatal glitches and left in the harmless ones like swimming through air and phasing through the gate Shadowcat style, for example.And last but not least:Resolve the cliffhanger from Year of the Dragon about Gnasty Gnorc and Ripto teaming up on another attack against our main heroes.  Just solely adding Ripto on stealing the dragonflies doesn't have that much dept in execution and isn't worth it in the long run.Here is another nitpick that I want to point out.  Even though Pamela Hayden returns as Bianca, is it me or was her microphone messed up during recording?  This is because her voice was a little bit squeakier than its predecessor for some reason.Here is also a saving grace.  Once again, the Stewart Copeland music was excellent as usual.  I recognize his signature music style anywhere.  He is well-known for being the drummer for the band known as the Police and did a fair share of film scores and the first four console games of this series during a hiatus with some notable examples being Rumble Fish and TV's The Amanda Show as well as a few mistakes like Good Burger and Highlander 2: The Quickening.In conclusion, it isn't the worst game I have ever played, they at least tried with that amount of time they were given, and the Gamecube version is an improvement over the PS2, but it still makes you wish you were playing the PS1 trilogy instead.",2,"Rushed, but at least better than the PS2 version",1321228800,"11 14, 2011"

Beatmania is a Japanese game where you hit buttons on a board and use a turntable to scratch with.  It was first created in 1997 when Konami started their music game campaign in Japan, taking arcades by storm.  The ""notes"" had to be in a timely order with what was on the screen.Fast forward to 2005, and you have Guitar Hero.  A game where you pick up a plastic guitar and strum to the modern and classic riffs of guitar bands. You had to play the ""notes"" in timely order of what was shown on the screen.Guitar Hero is ""cool"" (despite the 6-year-old looking plastic guitar) because of the music. In terms of innovation or orginality, there is none.  Guitar Hero is exactly the same game that Beatmania is, but it has different music.  The scoring system is the same, the level progression, even the breaks in the song if you screw up the riffs are the same as Beatmania.  The only difference is you use a plastic guitar, while with Beatmania you hit big buttons on a board to annoying J-pop songs.Dave Chappelle said it best when he told his audience white people relate to electric guitar.  This is exactly why Guitar Hero is so popular in North America right now.  Red Octane simply took Beatmania, and made it for white people to enjoy. The music drives people to play this game, and the licensing will get everyone from a metalhead to a goth-emo kid wishing they were in a band after playing.  This game will be a blast to play if you like or ever liked rock music.If Konami never released their music/dance games, Red Octane would be out of business.  I think this game is fun for what it's worth, but in terms of innovation, I'd give it a zero. I endured listening to j-pop on Beatmania, so I'm glad Red Octane made something worth playing for people in the states.",2,Beatmania... I Mean Guitar Hero Was A Good Game!,1158624000,"09 19, 2006"

I spent about 150 hours or more playing that game. When I heard about New Vegas I wasn't all that excited about the story. Then when I got the game it felt more like a western than a Fallout game. I love the other Fallout games for their leaving the vault story lines along with a dark post nuclear war atmosphere. Not with New Vegas. The sky is blue and you see tumbleweed going by. Not really a Fallout world in my opinion.  I thought I could get over all that so I bought New Vegas. I played it for about 4-5 hours before selling it on Amazon. I was really disappointed. I hated the story and the graphics engine hasn't been improved at all.

9256,95422,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B000X25GW2,E. David Swan,"[0, 0]","Two things prompted me to purchase this game; the positive reviews from online gaming sites and the low price. What I ended up with is one of the most overrated games I have ever played. The game starts off well enough with a helpful tutorial. The fighting engine is interesting and puts the Wii remote to good use. Next, players are launched into the action exploring a mansion and testing out new skills. Right off the bat I was disappointed to see that players have essentially no interaction with the environment. Goldeneye was doing environmental destruction over a decade ago, would it be so hard for modern games to feature it? Each level consists of fighting through waves of enemy foot soldiers before battling the boss level assassin. For the most part the enemy assassins are creative and fun to fight but it felt like UBI Soft ran out of steam as the enemies seemed to get less interesting as the game progressed..When my wife saw me playing the driving portion of `No More Heroes' she asked if it was the Wii's version of `Grand Theft Auto'. This was my initial reaction as well. The other game it reminded me of was True Crime: Streets of LA. Despite getting some pretty good reviews in its time I found True Crime to be painfully ugly particularly compared to the spectacular GTA. `No More Heroes' is much better looking than True Crime but it's still a poor mans GTA. The game features a lot of pop-ins as you drive through the city and the frame rate sputters along. The Wii is much more powerful than the GameCube but it still strains to produce a fully realized cities. The dimensions of Santa Destroy (dumb name) are puny compared to the ones in GTA although it is a fairly active city. My last issue is more a stylistic complaint. The designers decided to give everything in the game large jet black shadows but I just don't think it works. The graphics are already a bit muddy and adding all this black only makes it more difficult for the player to see.It's the fighting portion that got the reviewers attention and it's pretty good but like everything in this game it is extremely repetitive. As the game progresses you acquire a hefty list of wrestling moves. The problem is the wrestling moves are always inferior to the sword so I constantly found myself falling back on slash slash slash. This is symptomatic of a larger failing in the game. Everything is just so darn repetitive. Drive around, earn money, kill lots of people, fight a boss. Repeat.The thing that defines this game for me most is the refrigerator in your apartment. Opening the refrigerator heals your character completely but there is simply no way you can be in your apartment and not be at full health. It's sort of emblematic of how unfinished the game feels. By the end the designers just seemed to be trying to get the game to the market. Early on the player explores a decently modeled mansion but the lead up to one of the later bosses was just a seemingly endless narrow hallway. I kid you not. A completely non-descript hall with an enemy every 40 or 50 feet. I could think of so many games I would have rather been playing while I slowly walked down the tedious hall.In the end No More Heroes is a step forward for Nintendo as far as open ended city games are concerned but a step backwards in general as Rockstar has been producing better games in this genre for years on other platforms. The fighting is good but gets old and the exploration was done better by games I played a decade ago. In no area does the game excel not in driving, or fighting or adventuring or collecting. If I had it to do all over again I would not have purchased this game even at the reduced price.",3,Very Disappointing,1228694400,"12 8, 2008"

I am NOT trying to say that anyone who loved this game is wrong. I am saying that people like me who pay good money for this game will enjoy it only when giving it as a gift. And a wonderful gift it would make.I'm a big fan of RPG's! I really enjoy the open environments, the seemingly endless opportunity to explore, the hunt for loot, glorious loot! Hidden somewhere in that mix is a tremendous satisfaction in interviewing bystanders to glean the necessary information to advance the story line. There is so much to be had in an RPG. The richer the characters, the more engaging the storyline. The better the story line, the more clever the quests.  And so it goes. The wealth of an RPG is in the intricacy of the plot rather than the pace of the action sequences. (Of course, some hybrids seek to do both). Borderlands is about GREAT action; pulling the trigger and killing before being killed.I'd read so many glowing reviews of Borderlands. And, I admit, I was impressed by the many awards it received. I'd held off on buying it until I could snag the GOTY edition since DLC is getting very expensive. You spend $60 on a game, then $20 for each expansion...  More than $100 is too rich for my blood when it comes to entertainment. As a kid I'd learned to wait a minimum of as 12 weeks for things I ""sent away for."" Children of the 60's and 70's had to suck it up and learn delayed gratification. I'm really grateful, since it's patience is easier learned young. It's a lot easier to wait a year or more for a game you want if you are accustomed to putting the stuff you want on the back burner. And especially waiting for the GOTY edition to drop in price. I waited quite a while for this game.I thought I knew what I was buying. This isn't your run of the mill RPG... Which sometimes means you score an absolutely brilliant but unexpected game!  I was not prepared for Clap Trap.  I find sitcoms and canned comedy more than mildly irritating;  so my experience with Borderlands was headed for failure from the start. lol!I LOVE standup; I love wit, dry humor, and turns of phrase. but...I abhor canned laughter. cheap jokes and retreads that weren't funny the first time... I would have turned him off had I the chance...  But my problem with the game wasn't really the humor.  For enjoyment, I need  an intellectual challenge.  I thrive on nuance, plot twists, and ethical dilemma. I enjoy trying to decipher motive, who is telling the truth, etc. I even like being able to do the right thing. (As much as, I'll bet, some players enjoy playing the bad boy). The elements I need weren't present in Borderlands. And I've JUST discovered how much I like using magic in a game. That  was a complete surprise;  I'm not the fantasy-game type.Borderlands is wonderfully exciting and  adrenaline filled. That's a great plus for the majority of gamers. Most people will probably LOVE this game.  I'm numbered in a small minority of other gamers who get bored with the idea of blowing off heads. My inability to connect with the game was simply heightened by the humor that missed on so many levels for me personally.  Many elements will make this game great fun for the majority of gamers!For the very few small minority, like me, who require more... your enjoyment of Borderlands will be maximized by the look of joy on the face of the person you give your copy to when they realize what a thoughtful giver you are.

So it is hard for me to say that the OUYA, as it stands now, is a failure... for many reasons.  First, it is really hard to get behind an android gaming console that cannot use the games I already purchased from the Google Play store.  Want to play a game you already own?  Surprise, you have to buy it again!  Yes, it is possible to side load apps, but this is not a good solution because it takes more time and effort than it should, most apps just don't work, and those that do work are buggy at best.  Second, the menus are still very slow and sluggish.  There are some menu selections, like ""Discover"" that serves as the game store, that simply will not load because the page ""times out"".  So getting apps or games for your OUYA takes too long, if you can get them at all.  So the software just is not up to the standards required for a retail product.  Third, to access the OUYA you have to create an account.  Part of that process is giving OUYA a valid credit card.  It is one thing to use your card to buy games, but OUYA requires your credit card number just to power on the unit.  That is just bad business to me.  Lastly, the hardware also suffers.  The controller, that many have condemned, is just functional at best.  It was better than what I was expecting given the negative publicity and reviews, but it is probably going to be the worst controller in your house.  The bigger hardware problem is the spotty wifi that cannot hold a signal.  I have great wifi in my house and no other hardware has problems with a signal.  The OUYA can be sitting right next to my phone, which reads a signal strength of very strong, and the OUYA will say that my wifi is ""out of range.""  And even when the wifi does work the downloads are very slow, emphasis on very.I really wanted to love the OUYA, and I like to tinker with tech, but this system is just not worth the money.  Every reason to get the OUYA can be done better with another device.  Anything the OUYA can do my android phone can already do better.  If you want emulation, your PC can do that better.  Want to support indie games?  You can do that on XBox Live or Steam.  As a gaming console, just about any system will beat it.  The OUYA could become something great, and I hope it does.

We had another Gamecube before, and a Nintendo 64 before that.  So I'm not an ""XBOX Fanboy"" or whatever--I'm actually glad Nintendo is doing well.I just think the Wii is this year's Cabbage Patch Kid or Tickle Me Elmo.  Everybody wants once simply because everybody wants one.I'm also mystified at the ratings the Wii and its games are getting.  I picked up Metroid and Mario Galaxy and thought those would be ""sure things"" in a sea of awful games currently available for the Wii.  Boy was I wrong.NO CAMERA CONTROL FOR MARIO??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  This was a major step forward in platforming and gaming in general, all the way back to Mario 64.  It's a limitation of the Wii hardware, I suppose, so I think it fits here in a general review of the Wii.How is ""pointing"" the Wii-mote in Metroid better than an analog stick?  At least you have ""camera"" control with the pointer, but is it really any better than using a second thumb stick?  I don't think so.Graphics.  We all know about the graphical shortcomings of the Wii.  Both Metroid and Mario are hailed as offering some of the best graphics available on the Wii.  Well, that's not saying much, compared to even the WORST games on the XBOX 360.  This is definitely ""last gen"" hardware, graphically speaking.  That's too bad, because the Gamecube could hold its own against the original XBOX and PS2.Wii Sports - yeah, yeah, yeah, my Mom played this with my son this morning, which would have NEVER happened on the 360.  I guess this should make me shed a tear for inter-generational gaming.  I found the games to be utterly random and unpredictable.  My kid flailing wildly threw more strikes than anyone.  Huh?You need to be squarely in front of the TV to play it appropriately.  It's a consideration.If you're used to gaming on the PS3 or XBOX 360, I think you will be disappointed in most aspects of the Wii.  The ""ace in the hole"" for the Wii is the motion control, and IMO it isn't implemented all that well.We had lots of fun with the Gamecube and N64.  And, in fairness, my kid has been playing the Wii all day (and I do think the Wii Zapper is pretty slick), and this is a kid who plays a lot of 360.  So it may appeal to some.Also it appears to be a high quality machine, easy to set up, and well packaged.  We have 2 360s and they've been fine, but you can definitely tell the Wii is one polished piece of equipment.  That's always been true of Nintendo equipment, and this is no different.And bully for the average person who enjoys a Wii because they're intimidated by the controls and games of the PC, XBOX 360, and PS3.  Some folks will enjoy the Wii's simple--but IMO shallow--pleasures.I played it today and may continue to do so for ""quality time"" with the kids.  But for quality gaming, and the best titles, I'll stick with my 360.",2,Most overrated machine in console gaming history,1198540800,"12 25, 2007"

Just when you think the game is going to move onto the next chapter, the soundtrack builds to a crescendo and the credits start rolling. The game abruptly ends after a few hours of gameplay. It seems to me that this game was more of an experiment with the new CryEngine 2 and DirectX 10 support rather than an actual game. As in ""The Empire Strikes Back"", the storyline in Crysis leaves you hanging. It does not end when the game does! The game ends with your squad leader going AWOL and you have to find him. You know they're going to charge you more money later on to find out what happens when you meet up with him. If people pay the full retail price for a game, shouldn't they get the full game all at once up front? Pay $50 now and wait a year to spend another $40 on an ""expansion pack"" just to finish the game. What kind of underhanded garbage is that? That should have happened in the first place! If it's not finished, don't sell it!The audio is atrocious. It's just bad. I mean, the audio in this game is so unsynchronized with the rest of the game that during an in-game movie, the computer *appeared* to freeze, but was just trying to sync the game up with the dialogue. It took about 30 long seconds of waiting to see if the problem was with my computer or not. This is a recurring problem on many other peoples' computers, even with the latest Sound Blaster cards. There have been many times during an intense battle where the sound of the guns has dropped out altogether, and the dialogue is extremely choppy. EA needs to work on a patch for this audio problem. I ran the game with the -DX9 command line parameter to play the game in DirectX 9 mode, and the audio was *STILL* choppy and full of delays.Please, please wait until the price on this game has gone down. I know you want to see how the game looks with DirectX 10 graphics, but there is a demo of this game available for free online. Crysis is yet another expensive big-name game you can complete over the weekend on the most difficult setting without any cheating (which I did - unless you consider using the quicksave and quickload feature cheating).*************************************************************************[Now onto the good stuff - yes, there are good things about this game....]I really liked the motion blur, and the shading in DX10 is out of this world. I have not seen a more beautifully rendered computer or video game on the market. Even BioShock, which is supposed to support DirectX 10, doesn't come close to the realism of the graphics in this game. The close-ups with the enemy are breathtaking. If you have all the video settings to ""Very High"" and are running on DX10, when you go toe-to-toe with a bad guy in the middle of the day while on the beach, and decide to melee attack him, it looks so incredibly real that you might forget you are playing a game. The facial expressions are very detailed and well put together. It's just scary real. There was a time in computer/video gaming where you were doing a great job if you used three triangles to make a nose. This is by far light years ahead of those days (and the rest of the competition, for that matter).The gameplay is good. I love the quick save/quick load feature. I hate when games don't have it. The different abilities of the character's suit are fun, too. Too many bad guys flanking you? Turn the cloak on and retreat. Can't jump high enough to reach that ledge? Use the maximum strength setting and try it now. Need more info on gameplay? Download the demo.There is no way to upgrade your suit or your character's attributes. This is not one of those kinds of games. One major beef I have with the AI is that they can see me through the thick vegetation that is all throughout the game, but I can't see them. Yes, there are more of them, but even when I move around, they keep shooting at me perfectly, regardless of how many trees there are between me and them. The only real way to hide in this game when you're close to the enemy is to use the stealth mode. When you so much as throw a grenade at them, the stealth mode is deactivated and you are exposed. I can understand the stealth mode deactivating itself when I open fire, but lobbing a grenade? Shouldn't there be a distinction?The stealth mode is so incredibly useful when you're floating around in the alien ship. The faster you move, the quicker the stealth mode will expire, so when you remain still, it will last much longer than if you are sprinting. Using the stealth mode, I sneak up to the aliens and get close enough to grab them, then I blast them into smithereens, turn the stealth mode back on and do it again.All in all, a very good half of a game, but we'll have to wait a while to pick up where this game leaves off. Good gameplay, engaging storyline, outstanding graphics, way too short. It'll be a while before we see a Crysis 2. The big wigs are going to milk Crysis by putting out expansion packs, when they should have just made the complete product and sold it all at once. I guess the days of buying a complete game are over (as are the days of getting gas for 89 cents a gallon).",3,"Eye Candy Galore, But Way Too Short",1195430400,"11 19, 2007"

Of course not, but I have to admit, I expected more. I've seen slow starts before, but here in early 08, I'm still getting impatient and want some killer titles.My problem is the lack of games. For 6 months I think I saw the same games sticking around at WalMart shelves, mind you, this has nothing to do with the system, oh wait, yes it does, because you need games to play on a system, right?  I don't care how much power this baby has, and I know it does, but where are my games? Hot Shots Golf has been delayed 6 times since launch day, and still nowhere in site. Metal Gear Solid, Gran Turismo, give me my games!!!  But under me being so impatient and wanting mroe, I still find an awesome system under that shiny black hood.One of my big attractions personally was the backwards compatablity. I an comfotably assume, most will want to be able to play their PS1 and Ps2 games on their ps3. I played Rayman from the PS1 for the first time and looks better than ever. The PS3 gives you the option to ""smooth"" or the guru term is ""anti-aliasing""  all the old games. It's good for older games because on the old systems games suffered from ragged and broken textures, but the PS3 marvelously smooths games out and makes them look more polished. YOu can also choose ""Full screen"" for old games too, which makes the games look great on owners with widescreen TVs.Now I heard they are discontinuing backwards compatibility which is a huge blow for many, so if you can, stick with te 60 or find a 20gig one which I have which still will play all the old games out of the box. I still play my Hot Shots Golf games and they look awesome. I can only assume they are cutting it out to cut costs and make the system cheaper, but I think many will still agree, it's still a mistake...I finally played a must have game, Uncharted - Drakes Fortune. This is what the PS3 needs. It lacks so many genres at the moment it's not even funny. I've heard of games being glitchy and even sometimes unplayable. Fear was mentioned on that list and Madden and College football couldn't even play at a smooth 60 frames per second. Other ported games have also been hammered by critics. But, it's time to move on. Glitches aside, I think the system is finally coming around as I see a bright future as ther are some awesome games coming, Devil May Cry, Metal Gear, Gran Turismo,  Burnout, HOt Shots Golf 5 (finally) and many others.Since I've had it, (over a year now)  one thing holds true, it's reliable. I've used my powerful PS3 to play DVD, Blu Ray DVD, music CD's, etc, you name it, it's used contantly and did not broke down like my 360 did. Sony's system's always seemed to be made well, the PS3 is no exception.The controllers are classic feel, but they feel cheap, and there is no ""vibration"" like we had in the dual shock controllers for the PS2. I heard one is in the making, as that will be nice. The 'no cables"" is still a massive plus, I lvoe wireless controllers and for the most part, they seem to work, but like I said, they feel flimsy and cheap, too bad the sticker price on them doesn't agree.Blu Ray fans will love the PS3. Mind you, I think they are bit pricey, i Mean, lets face it, the prices of blu-ray movies are off the charts, anywhere from 24.99- 40 bucks. The picture, audio, quality is awesome, but is it worth buying a movie that you may already own? I've done the latter, I buy movies I don't own or new releases. The Harry Potter collection is awesome, movies like that are must haves. Spider Man 3 and Ice Age are 2 of the best movies to see in Blu Ray in my opinion.So should you buy a PS3? Well, if you want game selection, lets face it, Wii and 360 have the Ps3 beat right now in early 08. But 08 looks like a watermark year for the system. However,  they are removing ""backwards compatibility"" which I believe that is huge mistake, I mean, do people want to buy a system without being able to play their collection of PS2 and PS1 games? Me personally, I bought my system just for that reason, I have 40 pS2 and 25 PS1 games and they play great. If you lose that ability, it's a big knock. Sure, the system price drops in the process, but what to do with those games we can't play? If you can find one (the 60 gig) or classic 20 gig, you can play them out of the box, if you go for the 80, remember that will not have the BC ability. However, if you're just wanting to play PS3 games, then go for the 80 gig, the more the merrier. 08 looks to be agood year, lets face it, 07 was horirble for Sony, the games were weak at best with only a few exceptions. I say go for it if you have the dough, just expect a while for games to finally get released but expect some good games this summer.",4,"It's do or die for Sony in 2008, time to make your move...",1199318400,"01 3, 2008"

Improvements over the original include those graphics, better sound, a better level editor and did I mention the graphics?  The game plays faster, not quite Q3 fast but certainly faster than UT and the weapons have been remodelled and ""balanced"", with the teeth extracted from the Flak Cannon (less flak) and the Rocket Launcher (no grenade launcher mode, maximum 3 rockets in one shot) particularly.  The ridiculously overpowered sniper rifle has gone too, to be replaced with a high-powered by unwieldy lightning gun that takes time to recharge (think a rail gun with a zoom and lightning graphic and you'll get the idea).Gamewise Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag all make an expected appearance along with a new mode, Bombing Run and the not so new Double Domination.  Bombing Run is a sporty-type game in which your team scores points by delivering a ball into the opponents goal.  Whilst you have the ball you cannot use any other gun but the ball launcher and you score by either shooting the ball into the goal or for more points running it in (and usually get sliced up in the process).  Although a lot like Capture the flag, at least this mode is fun, as opposed to Double Domination which is merely a chore.  It's a variation on the original UTs Domination that if anything makes a poor mode worse.  The bots don't like it, and neither will you.  A return of the excellent Assault mode or something similar to Jailbreak would have been a far better choice.Offline play with bots is as good, if not better than ever, as the AI has improved to the point where just like real players, the bots themselves will ignore your ""suggestions"" and do their own thing.  Death animations have improved immensely and watching a corpse ""beamed out"" whilst standing near is pretty enough to get you killed!The maps themselves are something of a disappointment as there aren't really enough, those supplied aren't really that good and they take far too long to load.  Maps will come, they always do  (Epic are even rumored to be putting out a pack of them soon) but its a shame there wasn't enough good ones straight out of the box.Finally there's adrenaline, which 'provides you with the extra energy needed to execute special Adrenaline abilities'(from the manual)  Any more than that I can't tell you as I would have to buy the game guide to find out!

Heavenly Sword, the eagerly anticipated hack & slasher from Sony, may look as if it's a toned down God of War, but don't let that fool you.  Boasting some incrediblely mouth watering graphics and superb controls, Heavenly Sword puts you in the role of Nariko: a female warrior who wields said sword and takes down hordes of enemies in the process.  While this may sound like it'll get boring after a while (like many games of the genre do), Heavenly Sword manages to keep things pretty fresh by implementing different play styles, playable characters, and puzzle elements as well.  The game also boasts some incredible production values, excellent music and sound effects, great voice acting, and entertaining cinematics and story as well.  The only real negative to Heavenly Sword is that the game is quite short.  It won't take you long to get through the game (you could beat it in an afternoon if you so desired), and though there are a nice selection of unlockables and extras to find as well, the replay factor isn't very high here.

As many have written in other reviews already, this is NOT a typical MGS game. However, the turned-based style, while slower in pace than most games, does provide a unique perspective and tons of entertainment value. The mechanics of the game is well-done. The plot is convoluted and confusing as any other MGS game, but gets you through the game. You can save anywhere, which is a must-have for portal gaming.I have spent over 30 hours on this game, and thoroughly enjoyed most of it. I say 'most' because parts of this game can be tedious. The single biggest negative is that some levels are repetitive and are similar to previous levels; these levels should have been removed in my opinion because they do not add to the story or gameplay. There is also some back-tracking of levels which was not a huge deal but artificially lengthens the game. Also, there are times when you are sitting around waiting for the right card to come up to complete a specific task/move.Also, one other gripe is that there is no way to know what type of mission you will be getting into and you aren't able to configure your equipment/weapons after finding out the nature of the mission. On several occasions, this forced me to quit the mission in order to adjust the loadouts appropriately to fit the needs of the mission. It would have been nice to be able to modify the equipment AFTER finding out the mission objectives. There was one instance where I absolutely needed a sniper rifle to complete the mission, but was unaware until about halfway through the mission; at that point I had no choice but to quit and restart that level, which was frustrating.All in all, as long as you are aware of the shortcomings and can deal with them, this is a great game for all fans of TBS games!",4,Solid turn-based strategy game with a few quirks,1284163200,"09 11, 2010"

But the game is riddled with so many serious problems that it's difficult to enjoy even the story.The primary problem is the game's over-simplicity. Almost the entire game involves reading dialogue (*lots* of dialogue), doing fetch quests (almost all of which play out identically because of the incredibly tiny game world), battling, and alchemizing. Each of these tasks is so simple they're like mini-games, and the gameplay, essentially, never changes. Battles in particular are much too frequent and so simple they can almost always be fast-forwarded (with the Y button) until you've attacked enough times to wipe out the enemy. You level up, you get new gear, and you go out into the world again to fight other creatures. This quickly becomes tedious as the battles are almost invariably incredibly simple and easy to win, except for a few bosses where you'll actually have to heal and maybe use a specific weapon to attack with.Alchemizing involves looking up a recipe (which is much too cumbersome) picking up to three items and hitting alchemize. You have a displayed percentage for succeeding. If you succeed, you get the item. If you don't, try again. Very few of the items are actually useful to you, and you'll be alchemizing meaningless items to complete endless fetch quests. It's just not any fun, and the clunky menus don't help any.The lack of an English dialogue option is crushing. There's so much spoken dialogue in the game, but the developers didn't bother to *translate* all of it. Yes, that's right, you will hear Japanese dialogue with no subtitles frequently during events. Only story sequences have subtitles; not battles, not random voice clips (of which there are many, including one that repeats *every* *single* *time* you go into the main town; based on the little Japanese I know from other games and anime, I believe she's saying, ""So, where will I go today?""), not even some brief events. If you don't speak Japanese, you won't understand quite a bit of it due to the lack of subtitles. It's infuriating.Something else that really irked me was the difficulty at getting multiple endings. It's not that the tasks you're asked to do are difficult; it's that triggering them at all is difficult and far too random. Additionally, there's one ending in particular that's extremely difficult not to get, as I inadvertently got it on both my playthroughs. This happened because, to get it, you have to reach Master level of alchemy. Except it's far, far too easy to get this level just by doing basic quests until the time limit runs out. The other endings require you to be very precise and specific as to what you're doing, and it's never explained at all how to get these endings without looking it up. And for most of them, you have to worry about *not* becoming a Master of alchemy. You can get two or three other endings (including the ""best"" ending) if you do other tasks during the game in addition to becoming a Master, but the majority of them are triggered by showing up somewhere at a very specific time, which is impossible to keep track of without a guide. Basically, getting all the endings requires a lot of time and tedium, and a guide that you'll be frequently referring to if you want to get multiple endings.I don't like at all the strict time limit you have for doing anything. There's never any time to relax in the game; there's always something you need to do and there's often no time to spare. Worse, if you need to wait for some reason (such as near the end of the game when you're just killing time), there is no way to pass the time without traveling from place to place to pass the days. On my second playthrough, I was spending the majority of the end of the game just killing time because there was nothing else I could do. As mentioned before, story sequences which exist to get you different endings are difficult to trigger and are only available at frustratingly strict times. It's all but impossible to trigger them all. Unfortunately, if you play it more than once, you have to sit through the same gameplay again. It just doesn't flow, and you're always being rushed.Basically, the game's story sequences are what carry it. The gameplay is merely a repetitious way to pass the time until the next story sequence. If you like reading anime comedy, maybe you'll like it somewhat, but the gameplay just gets in the way. Not recommended unless you really like *watching* anime comedy.",2,"Original, but overly simple and tedious",1262908800,"01 8, 2010"

Forget side trips, looking for anything special or worrying about taking wrong turns.The story is about a meteorologist in the Arctic trying to reach a ship for his return home.Upon finding the ship it appears wrecked and you explore the ship and witness a chain of events leading up to the disaster. Some how you are able to interact with past events as you try to prevent the catastrophe. Weird, mutated humans will attack and you will witness ghosts in their last few minutes of life. During your adventure you will be moving from past to present and back with the ability to change some of the events or accidents that befall ship and crew. How? I don't know. I am still not sure whether you, the ship or both are ghosts.The game is little too linear but overall enjoyable as you became accustomed to the restrictive gameplay.Unfortunately the game is a little short since there is little exploration required; figure about 15 hours for most gamers. Weapons from pieces of metal to rifles will be found throughout. Health will be collected in the form of heat from various items such as light bulbs and steam pipes. (neat concept). Game physics are somewhat annoying. Sometimes you can jump 4 feet high and another time you can't jump over a chair. Also, your weapons feel like they're made of rubber with a weight tied to the end.

With this game Activision has effectively changed the way video games can empty the pockets of unsuspecting parents whose children are speedily hooked and wanting more!The design of the game is simple. The game allows you to play as whichever character you place on the 'portal of power'. Each character has special abilities (strength, speed, shields, etc). Characters also belong to one of eight specific categories (Magic, water, fire, air, etc). The starter pack comes with three skylander figurines and they are supposedly enough to finish the entire game. When we got this item to review, my kids were confident that they would not cave in to marketing gimmicks and materialistic impulses and would not buy any more figures than those included in the starter pack. Ha!Well, the key word in starter pack is 'STARTER'. Yes, you could finish the game with just the three figurines included but as you discover new areas within the game, it ever so sweetly reminds you that you need a skylander with a different power in order to access the closed areas of the game. So there are all these tantalizing areas closed off to you unless you rush out and get, for example, a Tech skylander or an Undead skylander. At $8 each the individual investment seems slight and kids fall for it lock, stock and barrel.  At this point my kids are the nearly bankrupt owners of 8 skylander figurines and are waiting for Amazon to restock so that they can get two more and have all areas of the game available to them. And after that, the game also has more expensive expansion packs available for purchase! A 13yo who played the game with us saw through marketing strategy at once and realized that to really beat the game you'd have to buy the additional figures. The younger kids didn't really mind, even after it was explained to them.Game Design : The graphics are mostly excellent with some cut scenes having a grainy quality to them but for the most part the game and most cut scenes have excellent resolution. The in game upgrade shop is well laid out although it is hard to get the necessary materials for the best upgrades. The game does not have a clear explanation in the beginning that explains your goals as a player but it is very simple to learn as you play.  The two player scenario is fun for everyone in that both players have jobs to do and the second player isn't just a random tag-along. If you've ever had to be second player with your child on Super Mario Galaxy 2 you will know what I mean! The two players have a virtual rubber band connecting them. Get too far and the other player will haul you in his direction willy nilly. Can be annoying at times but forces teamwork.Violence : The gameplay involves puzzles, mini games, adventures and shoot outs. While rated E10 the violence is more like that of the Lego games - no gore and the battles are accompanied by maniacal giggling and squeals that are more contagious than irritating. The characters are hilarious even as they throw fire balls, use machine guns and are attacked by evil little monsters that look like stuffed toys with fangs. I think Disney villains are scarier than this!Accessibility: You can also play the game online using the codes that come with each figurine. I like that option for when we travel. The website also allows you to play a decent amount of the game without having bought any skylanders so you can try it out and see if it is something your child might like or not. Each skylander also stores the game progress of the player so your child could use his figurine to join in a game when at a friend's home.Bottom line : this is an awesome game but it has the potential to be a real drain on your pocketbook. If it gains in popularity (at the moment it is sold out everywhere so this looks like a definite possibility) and turns into a figurine trading craze like the card swapping in Pokemon, it is going to be a real nightmare for many parents! I wouldn't be surprised in the least if Pokemon does not jump on the bandwagon and churn out a similar game with Pokemon figurines within the coming few months.

7289,182116,ARPNWDZ9516X,B0050SWUTQ,Melia Galloway,"[7, 8]","I must start this review by saying the previous Dead Space games are my all-time favorite games. Dead Space is actually what got me into gaming so holds a special place in my heart. I played Dead Space from beginning to end over 10 times and Dead Space 2 over 5 times (Hard Core included). I have had Dead Space 3 pre-ordered since E3 last year and was counting down the days. So my intense love with the series definitely plays a large part into my opinion of the game, but I will try to keep it from coloring my review too much.Plot: The plot is very well done and answers many questions, like what convergence is and the purpose of the markers, but still left enough questions unanswered to easily continue the series. The first about 8-9 chapters felt a little slow to me and took me a little to really get into the plot, but the last 5 chapters were very intense and enjoyable as you got closer and closer to the climax.Gameplay: The gameplay keeps some of the traditional aspects of the original games while it changes others. One of the big changes, as I'm sure everyone is aware of, is the removal of credits (and nodes) and adding resources and a bot instead. You now use resources that you find, or your bot collects, for you to make items, weapons from blueprints or your own unique weapons. You still have the `node' rooms from the previous games but to gain entry you now need to use precious resources to craft a tungsten bar. When I first started playing I missed the traditional bench and credit system but after I crafted my first original weapon (shot gun + rocket launcher biotches!) I quickly learned how awesome the new resource and crafting system was. It's very streamlined, and I love how you can switch parts around to see what works the best without loosing any circuits or parts. However, one thing the game doesn't clearly state, and I only learned because my sister told me, is how to maximize your bots ability to collect resources. Your radar on the bot shows you where you should go (with arrows showing if you need to go up, down, or on the correct level) until you see blue circles on the bot screen.  Like a moron I thought I was just supposed to place the bot in the direction of the radar. You will still get resources but you will get tons more if you place them in the resource rich areas. If the new craft system isn't to your liking, once you beat the game you can then play Classic mode, which eliminates the co-op function and crafting system. Like the original games, you can only make weapons made from blueprints you find.Another change is how the suits function. All the suits are the same except for some having more slots then others. So there is no difference from using the Witness Suit to the Arctic Survival Suit except the appearance. You still upgrade your rig like normal and that's what makes your suit better. Some may like this feature but I must admit I miss the classic style of each suit having their own bonuses and benefits, where a suit from the beginning of the game will be much worse then a suit at the end. Now getting a new suit or changing into a suit doesn't really feel like a reward anymore.Along with the main quest there are about 10 optional missions you can do (including co-op missions). These are always high risk but rich in rewards. You don't have to do them but I would suggest doing all of them at some point since they add to the gaming experience.Something I don't like is the auto-save function. I typically like games that auto-save, but there have been many times where I have assumed I have saved my progress only to load up and start most of the level over again. Once I was loaded into the middle of 3 necromorphs, which was annoying. I would have much preferred the original save function instead of the new auto-save function.Another small change is the ability to crouch and roll. I almost never used the functions, so I don't really have much to say on this. I've seen some people don't like the idea of Dead Space adding this function, but all I have to say to that is don't use the function then. I made it through the game without a problem with only using the crouch and roll a couple times. This isn't because I didn't like the function but I am so used to the original games I just didn't remember to use the functions.Enemies: I think this is my biggest caveat of the game. In my opinion, this is one of the big things that made the game feel less like a horror survival game, like the original ones, and more like a horror action. The first games were eerie and scary and gave you that feeling of isolation. The games would give you glimpses of enemies or sounds that would have you peeking around corners to make sure nothing was there or whipping around with your gun in fright. However, this game simply piles the enemies on you to the point you don't even have time to feel scared. This doesn't make the game harder, it just changes the gaming dynamics for the worse. There were places where it was just annoying with how many enemies they piled on you. After the first couple of chapters I stopped being cautious and started just storming into every new area. I could also pretty much predict where the enemies were going to come from.They do introduce a couple new enemies like Feeders (which are easy to kill but extremely annoying) and Wasters (just plain annoying and DON'T DIE in the harder difficulties), but most enemies were recycled from the previous games. They do also have a couple cool big enemies but only about 3 of them.You are also now fighting against Unitologists which added an interesting new dynamic to the game. I actually like the addition of humans and it fits with the plot. You have a bit different fight style with them then with the necromorphs which adds a nice change of pace.On top of the enemies you also have a lot more environmental hazards to fight past. You have to deal with being in space, piloting a craft, repelling, falling body temperatures, giant drills and more. The repelling parts lasted longer then I liked and I have no idea how I made it past the space flight scene, and getting the secret trophy while doing it, but otherwise most of them were enjoyable and added to the gaming dynamics and gaming experience.Graphics: Graphics are top notch, just like the previous games. The space scenes are amazingly done and give you the feeling of the quiet isolation of space, even with a co-op partner. The on-planet scenes in the snow are well done and makes you want to grab a blanket.Characters: Isaac is Isaac, the badass engineer we all love, just with less crazy thrown in. Carver is also pretty hardcore but a man hurting from the decisions he has made in the past and the loss of his family. Ellie is totally different. The only similar thing about her is her voice actress. She doesn't even look the same and she must have gotten the package discount of get a new eye and you get  off breast implants, which is fine but definitely unneeded. She isn't as hardcore as she was in the 2nd game which makes me sad. She was my favorite in game female characters. Denick, the main Unitoligist protagonist, is not as crazy and is more intelligent then previous unitologists, which makes him more dynamic as an enemy. There are other secondary characters that all have their little quirks and traits that makes them all unique characters.Co-op: I have only played up to chapter 10 of co-op so far, but I'm really liking it. It is definitely a different gaming experience then playing alone and entirely different from the previous games. I am playing with my sister with her being Isaac and me being Carver. So far there have been very few story differences in playing as Carver compared to Isaac, and that was only in the co-op only optional mission. It isn't the smoothest co-op by any means. For example, I will activate something as Carver while my sister is off doing something else, but then the cut scene shows Isaac is the one activating it. Poor Carver doesn't get any credit for doing these things. I understand why it was done this way, it just can be a bit jarring. Carver also has very few lines which is a little disappointing. But despite the flaws it is still fun to play with someone and can make the game easier. Or harder, especially if you play a part over and over again of flying through space where one or the other person would get hit by a flying chunk of space debris. Not that I experienced that...Conclusion: When I first started playing I did feel disappointed in the game and how it didn't have the same feel as the original ones. It took me about a week to play the first 5 chapters until I finally decided to just complete the game. As I played more I was able to get past my initial disappointment and started really liking the game. It is definitely different from the original games, which is still a bit of a disappointment, but it is still a really well done and fun game. As a Dead Space Game I would give it 3 stars but as it's own game I would definitely give it 5 stars. I would suggest this game to anyone who is a Dead Space lover and hope they are also able to get past their disappointment of the changes and enjoy it for the fun game it is.EDIT 04/03: After playing Dead Space 3 again on Classic and Survival mode, plus playing the DLC I am feeling more and more bitter towards this game. Isaac from the 2nd game is one of my favorite characters but the Isaac in this game is unlikeable and immature. Ellie is useless and holds no appeal anymore except to be used as a plot point. Even when you play as Carver he isn't even relevant to anything. He has almost no presence what-so-ever, even when you are playing as him. The few times he even becomes noticeable is when you do the co-op optional missions. The enemies are ridiculous and recycled and simply swarm you. In a couple sections you will get swarmed over and over and OVER by feeders (probably about 25 at a time will swarm you), which isn't scary at all just VERY annoying. There is no scare factor and it has lost that creepy atmosphere from the previous games. The game has 3 bosses and one of those bosses is used 3 times over. It has become a shallow sci-fi zombie game instead of the deep and creepy horror survival game from before. It has too many platforming parts, 2 or even 3 repelling sections was fine but more then that is not, and ridiculous mini-games. The DLC made me bitter because it was what the game SHOULD have been and annoys me they didn't make the game more like the DLC, which was great. Another thing that really annoys me is since I have this weird thing about getting Platinums, it really annoys me that the game forces you to play it 4 times to get a platinum. I know it's totally optional to get the platinums, but it just adds to my bitterness for the game. So after thinking more about this game and playing it through again my review has dropped from a 4 to a 3. The initial play was fun but as a Dead Space game it's a joke and doesn't even feel like it's part of the series.",3,What a nice ass..,1361404800,"02 21, 2013"

I freaking love Star Ocean, but this is the weakest title in the series.  Story telling is ok, but not great.  Graphics are pretty good for PS2.  Battle system is nor bad, but could be much better.  Half the time you'll miss the target because if you're attack isn't spot on, it counts as a miss.  Also, of you run out of MP, you die.  And yes, this is every bit as stupid as it sounds.  Also, the cut scenes are hard to follow because there are long pauses between each character talking and the background music is so loud, you can barely hear what they're saying.

Even if your very tempted.Ive played the 1st Kengo years ago when the PS2 was just entering the gaming world. Ah the primitive days of ""next gen"" Bouncer, Kengo, Twisted Metal Black ect ect. The days of simple, pretty, and moneywasting games. At a quick play through the game one thing is clear- graphics aside this one was obviously meant to be on the ps2.The Battle system is configurable yet the moves are still simple 123 combos that you interchange. And actually fighting is a dull few moments usually ending in alot of enemies yelping to death. The Majority of them just crowd around you gawking untill theyre quick demise. The controls are slower than wanted and very simple , vert slash, hor slash, scoot slowly, or attempt to grind your sword up to the enemy. The swordgrinding was a good idea but poorly played out. swordgrinding is just push, pull, break away, or try to shove and attack. The ""boss"" battles are just some slightly more agressive enemies with fancy clothes. One nice feature that it has is a instakill/major damage movement you can take out any enemy with(including a boss..or even yourself).There are some features that make this game unique compared to the usuall samurai/fighting/hackn slash genre#1 feature is that you gain experience!!! cool right!? no they ruined it with the fact that whatever experience you dont use is thrown away after each fight. and like it would matter the only thing you can use xp is for ""secret"" moves that are just simple strikes for your 123 combos. OH WOW I unlocked the Tiger's Fang Wave technique! oh wait its just a diagonal slash....  Ive found that after 2 or 3 battles worth of xp (usually 2 or 3 new ""techniques"") I have enough moves to do what I need.#2 You play as real famous samurai from the past. This is one of the major things that got me interested in even playing this game. How many samurai games out there blow their horn about loving samurai, yet they dont even have a real one in them? thumbs up for that feature.#3 Fighting mutiple enemies- a feature I think really makes or breaks a fighting game for me. so many times I play through soul calibur or ( insert fighting game here) Im siiting there stuck chopping up one loser when I could be doing it to 7 at once!One ""feature"" about this game I really didnt like was that during the main ""story"" mode your stuck fighting a bunch of 1 hit kill nobodies who every now and then do get in a lucky shot, and then going straight up against a boss might or might not be able to instakill you. Sucky thing is when they do....bam you have to reload and start the WHOLE fight over.

This may be a technological impossibility but it does lead to some interesting contrasts with the constant appeal of occult and religious beliefs.  Maybe satisfying gaming is a substitute for the same...but in continuing the analogy, that means Morrowind is a poor illusion.  It aims for what we want in a good RPG, a departure from a tightly scripted path that is the only flaw in a far superior game like Final Fantasy.  It tries to do though what it can't pull off, and the end result is more tedious and mundane than liberating.

While the first Force Unleashed was the fastest-selling Star Wars game of all time, it didn't particularly review well, and a staggering number of gamers quickly voiced their frustrations with the game's broken controls, cheesy force graphics and its detrimentally short length.  Still, that game did boast a phenomenal (and canonical) story that fit in perfectly with George Lucas' Star Wars lore.  The game shows the birth of the Rebellion against the Empire at the hands of Darth Vader's secret apprentice, codenamed Starkiller.  Beware of spoilers ahead, if you haven't finished the first game.  There were two outcomes possible...you could kill Vader and end up a mindless slave of the Emperor, or Vader would kill you, effectively making you a martyr and giving strength to the Rebellion.  The Force Unleashed II begins under the assumption that you chose the latter path.  That is its first problem...With that ending in mind, the story of The Force Unleashed ended...for good.  Lucasarts, however, were put on the spot to create a sequel, and to do that they had to deal with the pesky problem of continuity.  The result is a bland, contrived story that comes nowhere near the splendor of the first game.  Starkiller has been cloned, though it's never quite revealed if he is in face one of the clones.  Once he escapes imprisonment by Vader, the game begins as Starkiller's #1 priority is to find Juno Eclipse, his love interest and former pilot from the first game.  This motivation is played up too often, but comes off as whiny and selfish.  Moreover, the plot never moves on from that, making it fall flat on its face as it basically goes nowhere.  The end of the game features a similar ""light side"" or ""dark side"" ending, so we'll see how that ends up in the hinted-at sequel.  Ah well, the gameplay...Right off, The Force Unleashed II makes a fantastic first impression!  You're thrust into a thrilling fight to escape the planet of Kamino, with some impressive combat and a couple of awe-inspiring sequences where you're falling down to a platform far below...rain and obstacles coming at you while you use the force to dispose of them.  The combat in this game is ultra-tight and a vast improvement from the first game.  Starkiller is POWERFUL here...almost too powerful.  At your disposal you have twin light sabers (which can also dismember your opponents), the force lightning and the force push.  Soon after, you're given the force repulse, Jedi mind trick and light saber throw ability.  The result is an astonishing array of options for you to wreak havoc at your foes.  New kinds of enemies are introduced at regular intervals in this first level, and you have to figure out how to best defeat them.  Some are immune to force powers, others block all physical attacks.  By the time you finish this first level, it's not hard to feel exhilarated by the action in this game.  Then you hit the second level and do it all again...and again in the third...etc.  You'll fight wave after wave of enemies, but they're all the exact same enemies you fought in the first level.  It never introduces anything new.  After a short while, the game quickly becomes a chore until quite suddenly...it ends.  Yes, this game is short.  So short in fact, it's downright insulting.  You will not get sixty dollars' worth of content here.  On normal, you're looking at 4-5 hours...3 on easy.  There is basically no reason to pay full price for this game...at all.  I would highly recommend giving it a rental instead.The game's graphics are light years ahead of its predecessor.  I was frequently very impressed with the level of detail and how well the game runs.  You will occasionally run into some minor glitches and see enemies or obstacles floating in mid-air, but it doesn't happen too often.  The pre-rendered cutscenes are immaculate.  Unfortunately the same level of detail wasn't given to level design.  Each level really only has 2 or 3 different ""rooms"", which are repeated ad nauseum until you reach the boss.  Oh yeah...there's only 3 bosses in this game, and only one (the end of level 2) that's really great.  Also, speaking of levels, there's only about 6 of them and most get really boring.  This is because the majority of the game is spent on Kamino (which is grey and rainy) or an orbiting spaceship (which is grey and dark).  There's also a very very brief level on Dagobah (which is grey and jungle-y)...you see where I'm going with this.  Yes, the graphics are beautiful, but the locales chosen for the game are so bland!  Why not follow the example of the first game and give us some variety?  The game's second level is gorgeous...why couldn't we get more of that?So yes, this is The Force Unleashed II.  It's a fun game at times, but the horrendously short length keeps me from recommending that anyone fork over full price for this game.  It's a shame because the game has so much potential!  But in the end, it comes off as a rushed product.  Whereas the first Force Unleashed had a great story to make up for the poor gameplay, the exact opposite is true of the second game.  Unfortunately, there are many more games in this genre that feature great gameplay AND good stories (see Dante's Inferno, God of War III, Enslaved), so you decide if a sub-par Star Wars tale is worth it to you.",2,A very polished disappointment...,1288828800,"11 4, 2010"

8099,203738,AJNNNF726KSEA,B007XVTR12,"Scott Peterson ""I.T. Sme""","[2, 3]","Four things seem pretty consistent about any Call of Duty release:People will complain how awful it isLots of voodoo about how to improve graphics/network playPeople will buy it by the shovel load anywaysThe multiplayer will be accused of being awful with all kinds of balance issuesI play the game for both the single and multiplayer; in general the graphics in either mode seemed to have taken a big setep backwards, most likely a nod towards playability on consoles.  But really, these people complaining about how every single game crashes and unplayability must be using an ancient office PC with onboard graphics.  It runs smoothly on my three year old Dell with a GTX-460.  And don't get me started on all the ""fixes"" for network issues--it's always the same thing, someone with a magic configuration that does away with network problems, and they never work.The singe player story--when the previews first came out showing bots and drones with a futuristic feel I was disappointed.  I was hoping for a sequel to a 60's game it would be set in the near modern day environment of the 70's and 80's which is practically unexplored territory in games--plus I'd liked the original story.So I was pleasantly surprised that at least a good part of the game took place in the 80's....and then realized why people hadn't made games about it before.  Events like World War Two and the 60's Cold War/Space Race/Vietnam War have an overarching significance in our cultural memory.  The 80's US/Soviet Detente does not.  Yes, you get to see real life people like Jonas Savimbi and Manuel Noriega, but it seems to fall flat.The Modern Warfare/Black Ops villains were mysterious and powerful.  The Black Ops 2 one just never seems to connect--even though this time they give him plenty of motivation and back story.  I kept thinking--""Really, from nobody to all powerful global villain?""  Even though that's pretty much been the plot for all of them.So the single player isn't bad---more like unfulfilling.  Even the episodes in Afghanistan fighting on horseback seem like the same ingredients we've done before just mixed together a little differently.The story does have multiple endings--and it's only clear a few times where your choices are, and never really explained what you're leading up to.  Well, real life is like that also and it encourages some replay value to see how it works out.  At only about five hours it passes quickly.The multiplayer---again, four things always ruin the gaming experience:Balance issuesNetwork lag/problemsCheatersBad attitudesWhat the PC player community wants is dedicated servers.  Someone sets up and pays for a server, and it usually becomes a 'hood for a clan or group of gamers.  It also becomes a place where arbitrary rules and really bad attitudes prevail.  I lost track of how many poor excuse admins I ran into who banned anyone they didn't like or would change rules on a whim.  The plus--if you can call it that--is cheaters were supposedly kicked in a heartbeat.  In practice not so often.What's been the upcoming method is peer to peer gaming.  A player is randomly chosen as a ""host"" and is a virtual server for others to connect with.  Pluses are you don't need a dedicated server and you can play the game the way it was intended.  Minus is cheaters aren't kicked by anyone--and no, Steam doesn't seem to want to do much about them.Black Ops 2 has much more variety in perks, weapons, and so on.  As the weapons are ranging into science fiction you have to play them to get an idea what they're capable of.  A welcome introduction is leagues to class similarly skilled players together.  However, this does not feel like the Black Ops multiplayer--more like a product improved Modern Warfare 3.Almost anything else I can say about the multiplayer should be prefaced with ""so far.""  Balance seems good, Modern Warfare 3 was almost singlehandedly ruined by akimbo machine pistols.  Here it doesn't seem like there's one gun everyone uses, such as the Famas in Black Ops before they did some updates that depowered it.Network issues again haven't come up yet.  The most common problems are lag or skipping/missing connecting with a target.  I'd say easily 3/4 of the accusations of cheating are people who were on the good side of network lag.  To them the game is super easy, people walk into bullets, and they barely need to aim.  To those of us on the other side it was emptying sometimes a full clip for little effect into someone with unbelievable stamina and speed as the network was perpetually trying to sync us up to them.  Again it seems to be working pretty well.Cheaters.  Not yet.  Blacks Ops never had very many but they were all over the place in Modern Warfare 3.  Probably the most common is texture hacks--if you ever see someone's winning screenshot and the screen is all orangish red and the players are a featureless light blue, that's a texture hack.  They replace the textures on their game install with ones that make it much easier to see the enemy.  Second is x-ray vision--the enemy are outlined in purple boxes so they know where you are all the time. Next is the traditional wallhack--shooting through walls, which I hardly ever see because it's so obvious. Lastly is the aimbot.  The most extreme example I remember was someone in Modern Warfare 3 standing in the middle of the map mowing everyone down with an M60, swiveling instantly and ending with a final kill count of 224. More likely is someone with a very weak gun yet who always seems to gets good kills and headshots, even from impossible ranges.  The cheaters and developers know people watch for their stuff so they get better at acting and hiding it.Bad attitudes. In Modern Warfare 3 and finally Black Ops I finally had to mute everyone and turn off chat (font size 0) to quit listening to the ranting.  Again not yet, but I consider it inevitable.So finally----well to be honest I think the game is a 3.5 rather than 4, but it does have a fair amount of play value/",4,"Better than expected, but the franchise is showing it's age",1353974400,"11 27, 2012"

If you are considering getting this for a Wii, make sure that Wii has GCN controller ports; new Wiis don't have them.By design, I don't mean the shape of the controller or the placement of the buttons/d-pad/sticks, I mean the way it's built. It feels really cheap (even for a third-party controller), the buttons are terribly clunky, and the d-pad is unresponsive when it's not perfectly centered. Also probably worth noting is that the L&R; buttons can feel unresponsive as well; that's because they are pressure-sensitive but also built mostly like digital buttons, and most GameCube games don't respond at the slightest touch of the L and R triggers.This is really unfortunate because no one else makes a controller that lets you customize the buttons' input. The idea is great because some games have really awkward and/or just plain uncomfortable button set-ups, so if this thing wasn't so terribly designed, it would be the ideal controller to have.

All of the other enemies in the game could be shot by simply pressing the shoot button while holding the Wii Mote sideways, no strategy, no skill needed, the game auto aims and shoots the enemies for you when you press the shoot button (one of the only 2 buttons used for gameplay, jump and shoot). This took away any chance the game could've possibly had at being fun.The navigation through the buildings was so unbelievably confusing and you couldn't go back to certain areas after you've left them because the game wouldn't allow you to. Unlike in every other Metroid game where you could explore almost every area as often as you wanted.Another annoying thing was having to fight side by side with some kind of galactic federation team. Instead of fighting as a solo bounty hunter like in every other Metroid game. This game was terrible and I was barely able to sit through more than 5 hours of gameplay before my head started to hurt.I can't express how thankful I am for being able to sell this game, along with my Wii and everything I bought for it (immediately after I bought them) before I knew how crappy it all turned out to be.

Brown ""Ghost in the Shell""","[16, 22]","My review can be summed up with this; GTA5 is a great simulation, open world environment where you can interact with almost everything.  But it felt more like a demo than a full game.  I guess I would have felt better if I was expecting a simulation where I could drive around and stare off into the sunset.  I was expecting a complete and challenging game.  GTA5 is going to get good reviews and it may be a top ten ever game,  I just wish they did more than improve the visuals and expand the map.  The graphics, the textures, the movie sequences, the voice acting, the kinematic sequences, NPC characters driving and walking around are all great and probably superior to most other open world games, but that is all the praise I can give.  The actual game or any challenges in the game are non-existent.  There are no challenges in the side missions, there aren't any challenges in the main missions.  And for an open world, everything is heavily scripted.  Pick up this thing, here is the route, shoot at this guy, here is the gun, get in the plane, fly there, buy this, steal this.  Even if they didn't give the exact directions, even the toughest missions have you picking up 'car X' or 'car Y'.  Well how hard is that?  So what about the actual combat in the more comprehensive heist style missions?  The combat is definitely improved since the other GTAs and I am glad they give you the ability to crouch behind a wall, release and fire.  But this combat AI is laughable.  You may have 10-20 enemy guys out there but only one or two will shoot at time and awkwardly move to the next barrier.  The only challenge is that they throw dozens of characters at you but most can be taken out easily.  It all feels so scripted and almost boring.I have some suggestions for the next GTA.  I wish the world was truly interactive.  Like Fallout or Obvlivion, give the random NPC characters names and profiles.  Just like most average open world games developed in the last 20 years, the NPC characters in GTA5 randomly appear and go through their script.  It would be interesting if you randomly shot mayor Bob Jones of Los Santos and there is a funeral and media discussion, the city drops into chaos because the mayor is dead.  In Fallout, you can kill quest characters and just make due without that story line.  Also, I like how in Fallout, water, ammunition and misc items are all necessary to complete the game.  There is no reset button, if your character sucks or you can't gather the right items, it will be difficult progressing.With the GTA5 heist missions, you pick one or two members of the crew, out of a selection of two.  You pick up this truck, go through this entrance, shoot this guys, maybe the army or swarm of police show up.  But the game pushes you, what to get, where to go, how to get away.  How about this, rob this bank and that is it, if you screw up, you get to try a different strategy.- PROS:* Great world, great graphics* Great voice acting, interesting characters* Semi-interesting story between the three characters* Combat is finally improved* Sometimes the heavily scripted NPC characters do funny stuff- CONS:* Interaction with the open world is heavily scripted and purely stateless.  When you kill someone, start a fight with a gang member and die, everything resets.  It would be nice if it didn't operate that way.  It would be interesting if you kill a police member then the police go out of their way to screw with you for the rest of the game* Most of the game or side-missions feel like yet another adventure game.  Click a, b, move the joystick up, repeat, mission complete.* Combat is improved but the enemy AI is not very robust.  I died in the game, but I never had to improve my strategy to complete any mission.  I just went through the motions.",3,"Great open world simulation, OK game",1380844800,"10 4, 2013"

Rhodes,"[27, 45]","The Good:+Well realized, in depth environments+Satisfying gameplay throughout+Great music and voice acting+Lots of variety in the gameplayThe Bad:-Annoying Quick Time Events-A poorly realized cast of supporting charactrs-Lara Croft is not nearly as well realized as she could be.  There's a lot of potential here, but the game rarely pushes beyond a certain threshold with it.---NOTE: The following review is long.In 1996 the Tomb Raider series debuted on the original Playstation and immediately became a huge seller.  It was one of the biggest selling games on that particular platform.  Since then it has been a staple in the gaming culture.  Perhaps what people took most from it, however, was Lara Croft being a sex symbol, which kept her from being realized as a memorable character for anything other than her enormous pixels.  Soon a reboot was announced.  One that would try and develop Lara Croft more and add more dimension to her.  It tries but manages to stumble along the way.Tomb Raider wastes no time jumping into the plot.  Lara and her band of survivors find themselves stranded on an island while searching for the lost city of Yamatai.  Quickly stranded and separated from her band, Lara must find a way to survive.  But there is more than just the horrors of the mysterious island to worry about, a mysterious faction called the Solarii is also on the island.  And they're a brutal group as well.  Lara needs to figure out a way to survive, and she'll have to learn to do it.The story itself has potential but never quite reaches the ambition it's aiming for.  It's way of just jumping into things leaves a lot to be desired as far as character development goes.  There are bits of backstory sprinkled in there, but the cast of characters is fairly forgettable in the long run.  The supporting cast especially is extremely forgettable.  Most of them are there to play a very specific role or fulfill a very specific stereotype, but at no point do they ever really become memorable in any way.  Many of them might as well be invisible.  The dialog they spout off seems to only give you hints about what their role in the story should be, but never really establishes them beyond the trope they're supposed to represent.Lara herself isn't such a bad character, but how she grows through the story isn't quite as consistent throughout.  She's likeable, but there are moments where the story breaks the immersion.  For instance, Lara kills a man and cries but it's hard to find a lot of humanity in any of this when just seconds later you're mowing down the bad guys left and right with absolutely no emotional holds.  The leap from ""fearful young woman"" to ""brutal survivalist killer"" is swift.  To put it one way... the development of the plot doesn't quite match the development of Lara as a character through gameplay.  We're not introduced to Lara as a hardened survivalist, we're introduced to her as though she doesn't know what she's doing.  A woman who has never been in any real danger.  Yet she seems to adapt to her surroundings and danger rather quickly with no transition or revelations about what she's doing.  There's little gradual change in her character.  When she shoots down an animal for the first time we're treated to a scene of her feeling quite sorry for the beast... and then the game quickly puts an emphasis on hunting them down for experience.  What's the point of making her feel sorry for killing a helpless animal if she's immediately going to slaughter animals?  It's a character trait that is immediately subverted the moment gameplay begins again.  And the player is quickly rewarded for it.  The moment we are able to engage in gunplay you'll quickly forget that Lara was supposed to be scared.  It's not a gradual move from ""frightened woman"" to ""hardened survivor"".  This would be okay, if the story itself wasn't so downright insistent on this particular arc of Lara gradually coming into her own.Video games have been pretty good about bringing a characters personality into gameplay elements.  But Tomb Raider does no such thing.  It's hard to sympathize with Lara's vulnerability and perceived innocence when the next moment I'm running up to enemies and brutally executing them by shoving their face into the barrel of my machine gun and moving on.  Or sinking my axe into their skull.  It would be one thing if there was some emphasis on the idea, ""I must do this survive,"" but at some point the game overindulges itself in this and undermines what it's trying to do with Lara's actual story arc.  Again, if the game wasn't pushing her character arc so hard this would've been a non-issue.  But Tomb Raider is clearly trying to reach higher than that when you sit down and watch the cutscenes.The character of Lara in the cutscenes is inconsistent with her portrayal in gameplay.  And while that may not seem like much, consider that in many games we're usually introduced to characters who have already been in combat and thus in other games it's not really unusual.  The reason no one minds Solid Snake or Nathan Drake is because there's enough background to show us that they're no stranger to taking down people out to kill them and neither game tries to play this small conflict of having to grasp with the reality that they'll have to kill.  Tomb Raider, on the other hand, has a moment where it does.  Her personality rarely comes out beyond the cutscenes.  At no point when roaming around does she even seem to reflect on much of this.  The only thing that seems to harden Lara is that she's consistently getting the crap beat out of her throughout the game (more on that later) or finding herself in peril.  But we don't get a lot of heartfelt moments as the story progresses, or see Lara gradually become a hardened survivor.  And that's mostly due to the fact that her supporting characters just don't do enough to help Lara along in her development.  They do help out in her quest, but very few moments are spent where they just... talk.  She rarely has any natural back and forth moments with them that help establish her character or theirs.  And despite some hints of backstory every now and then, the way it jumps into the plot so quickly leaves a lot to be desired.The gameplay is another story.  The game is really fun and quite well done.  The pacing in Tomb Raider is pretty well established and well done.  There is some variety here to keep things moving along steadily.  Tomb Raider embroils you in combat, puzzle solving, exploration and survival.  You'll never feel overwhelmed by any one element at a time.  The environments feel big and expansive but for the most part you'll know where you need to go at all times.  There's a useful map if you need it.  Likewise, if you're ever confused at where to go or what to do you can easily toggle Lara's ""Survival Instinct"" which shows you where your goal is and highlights anything you can use in the area.  It's a much more straightforward and linear game than you might expect.  There are certain challenges in some areas (such as lighting statues with your torch) and sometimes you'll find that you need to return later when you have the proper item to do something, but for the most part the campaign is extremely straightforward.  There are also relics to collect as well as notes and diaries to find from friends.  Tomb Raider isn't short on content or longevity.You'll also be forced from time to time, to explore your environment.  You'll sometimes find yourself having to hunt animals to survive.  This brings about the experience system that Tomb Raider has in play.  As you perform certain actions or hunt animals or pull off kills, you'll gain experience.  These can be spent on skills such as getting more ammunition for your weapons, steadying your hands to fire a weapon and more.  You can also salvage the corpses of your fallen enemies and take components which can be used to upgrade your weapons.  It's a lot deeper than it sounds.  The more skills your learn and the more you level them up, the more become available to you in the long run.Most of the puzzles are pretty simple and straight forward.  The combat, on the other hand, can be a bit to get used to.  It's frantic and fast paced.  You'll start off with a lonely bow, but before you know it you'll have a handgun, shotgun and machine gun at your disposal.  Lara will crouch behind cover automatically whenever enemies are near, but she'll also stand whenever the area is clear--which is a nice indication that combat is over.  Ammo is pretty plentiful, especially because you can easily get more ammo from your slain enemies.  You can perform sneak kills when they aren't looking as well.About the only thing that keeps Tomb Raider down is that there isn't much in terms of melee combat.  Poor Lara can't seem to swing a punch to save her life (literally).  The press of the melee button will mostly just shove enemies out of the way so you can shoot them.  You'll be able to acquire skills later on that allow you to beat them with melee weapons, but Lara doesn't really punch or kick her enemies.  It would've been nice to have a full bonafide melee combat system here, but I suppose we can easily make due without.  The gun play is pretty satisfying, for the most part.The stealth element isn't quite as much.  You can stealthily kill your enemies, but most times you'll only result in getting involved in a gun fight.  It's only a matter of time before the enemies start noticing their numbers dwindling.  Even shooting arrows to distract them only deters them for a moment.  The stealth elements could most certainly use some work.Tomb Raider provides quite a few challenges.  Some gun fights and set piece moments are pretty tense and exciting.  You're sure to bite the dust a few times.  There will be moments where you'll screw up the first time you reach them and learn from these experiences.  On the other hand, the Quick Time Events here are pretty annoying.  While not as painfully annoying as say... Resident Evil 6, there will still be some times when you'll fail because of a quick time event you didn't quite know was coming.  The good news is that Tomb Raider isn't out to punish you.  It's pretty lenient as far as checkpoints go.  You almost always begin right where you died.  And if you fail a quick time event you'll more likely than not begin right at that quick time event and the button presses are usually the same ones.  After a while you'll be able to tell what button you'll probably need to press.  The game doesn't punish you for mashing on the Triangle button before triangle actually pops up, for instance.From a production standpoint just about everything Tomb Raider does is pretty good.  It's a sleek looking game with a clear defined art style.  The environments are really detailed and filled with life.  There were times when the framerate can get a little choppy, but it's not so bad.  The best part is that Tomb Raider does a pretty good job of masking some of its load times.  You'll know when the game is loading, certainly, but for the most part it keeps pressing on in some instances when it is.  The sound is also really good.  The voice acting is among the best you'll hear in any video game.  The music is good and tense like you'd expect.  And the sound effects are some of the best I've heard in a video game.On the other hand there are times when it feels like Tomb Raider is pushing just a little too hard in the gritty direction.  It's got a lot of dark moments, but very few of them seem to really be about establishing Lara as a character.  At some point it seems like many of them are there JUST so that you don't see Lara as a sex symbol.  There are more ways to create a well established character than just constantly showing them beaten and battered.  The problem is that there is little else done to establish Lara Croft as a character beyond putting her through hell.  Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with Lara being put through hell but... where's the heart?  We don't see a lot of well established emotional connections to other characters.  There needs to be more than showing Lara beaten, battered and covered in blood to get us to connect with her and sympathize with her as a character or see her as more dynamic.  It's dark and gritty but Batman Begins didn't just work because it was dark and gritty.  There was an emotional core that Tomb Raider seems to be lacking.Ideally, some gamers might not mind any of this.  The gameplay is sure to be enough to suffice, but for gamers looking for depth, it's not really here.  There's a great illusion that makes you believe there's A LOT here, but beneath the surface the game only appears to reach higher without actually doing so.  In the long run, the new Tomb Raider is worth playing.  It's a pretty fun game in its own right even if it doesn't quite reach the emotional heights it clearly set out to reach.",3,(3.5) Some Pretty Fun Gameplay In Lieu of Pale Storytelling and Characterization,1362441600,"03 5, 2013"

2443,128954,A13O1YCZCYT76I,B002BRZ9G0,Greg,"[0, 1]","Well, it's another Mario game.  I guess it shouldn't have suprised anyone.  At least one standard 2d scrolling Mario game per console, right?  That's the rule?  Why, though?  Why the repetition?  Why the same old format again and again?Because, frankly, if it ain't broke don't fix it.  And this stuff ain't broke yet.I'm not going to bother recapping what Mario is. If you're here reading game reviews on Amazon.com you know what Mario is all about, don't play innocent.  So the improvements in mechanics and visuals aren't even worth spending time on.  It's still Super Mario Bros.  If you like one, you like them all to some degree (controversial black sheepSuper Mario Bros. 2not withstanding).  I'll say the new level designs are fun, it's challenging without being murderously so, the new powers add an element of planning and strategy (sort of): all welcome and wonderful additions, if nothing groundbreaking.What is note-worthy is the multi-player.  For two reasons: it makes the game impossibly fun and it makes the game impossible. And this, THIS is what Nintendo has grasped better than all the other designers going today (the fun part, not the impossible part), despite how hard they try:  That GAMES are exponentially more fun the more people you can easily get invovled.  Mario is fun because it's silly, it's harmless, literally anyone with thumbs can play it at least a little bit (apologies to those without thumbs, no disrespect intended).  You can sit in a group of nine or ten friends, relatives or even casual acquaintences and pass the remotes around four at a time, bounce on each other's heads and fall down cliffs for a few hours with no real fuss.  It's a simple, side-scrolling social endeavor that reaps rewards while asking for almost no investment from the player.In fact, the less you get invested in the multi-player aspect the better, because it makes progressing through the game well-nigh impossible.  Quick, think of the timing and precision needed to beat the tougher levels in your favorite mario game.  Got it?  Now try and imagine four people matching that rythm simultaneously or even cooperatively.  Get the picture?  You will die, you will kill each other accidentally (and sometimes on purpose) and you'll fail at levels time and again. Yes, in multi-player you can come back from the dead (floating in a bubble until a friendly team-mate pops you free) but you share lives and goddamn do they go quick.  But here's the thing: it doesn't matter.  Because messing up the game en masse is easily as fun as beating it on your own.  It's a throw-away concept built into a pretty posh and polished platformer.  And that, my friends, is something special.If you don't care for Mario games, no, this one probably won't change your mind.  Though if someone asks you to play a few rounds with them, don't turn up your nose either.  It's not compelling, plot-driven, state-of-the-art anything.  It's not even anything new.

647,175101,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B004NRN5EO,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[2, 2]","The spiritual sequel to the cult hit ""Demon's Souls"", ""Dark Souls"" combines the challenging hack-and-slash gameplay of its predecessor with a more open world and greater difficulty.""Dark Souls"" is a third-person action-RPG set in a grim fantasy world. Those who have played its predecessor, ""Demon's Souls"", will find that almost all of the basic mechanics are the same. As a refresher for those who haven't, Dark Souls' gameplay involves defeating enemies by dodging their attacks with blocking and rolling, then countering with sword slashes, bow shots, or magic spells. Unlike most RPGs, Dark Souls is an action game first and foremost - closer to games like the Legend of Zelda than most other RPGs. Defeating enemies provides the player with Souls, a currency used to upgrade the player-character's abilities or purchase items. The game's main defining trait is its difficulty; death comes quickly, and dying takes all of your currently-held souls (i.e. those not spent on upgrades or items). The game's tagline is ""Prepare to Die"", and if a player goes into the game expecting a cakewalk they are in for a rude surprise.The main difference between Demon's Souls and Dark Souls is the nature of the world. In Demon's Souls, the player began in a Nexus that allowed them to teleport to different worlds to defeat bosses. In Dark Souls, the whole world is one big connected map in a manner akin to games like Metroid or Castlevania. Therefore, exploration is far more important, whether it's to find the next area or to find shortcuts back to previous ones. The world of Dark Souls is littered with ""bonfires"", safe areas that restore health and allow you to manage your experience, inventory, magic, and so on. These bonfires are also the only way to fill your ""Estus flasks"", one of the only means of healing available in the game, so conserving resources is more important than in Demon's Souls. This adds to the difficulty mostly because using a bonfire respawns all enemies in the world, so it's possible to run out of healing supplies before you've reached a boss and be forced to go all the way back and try again. The amount of Estus a bonfire provides can be increased by feeding it ""humanity"", a resource that can be acquired by defeating enemies or helping other players in co-op play, but there's an upper limit to how much Estus can be carried.While exploration and a certain amount of freedom does exist in the game, there's also some things that must be done in a linear fashion (or at least mostly linear). Bosses, for example, will often block hallways that cannot be passed until the boss is defeated. This can be frustrating if you're having trouble with the first few bosses, but after about the first hour of play the world opens up a bit more and allows you to always have somewhere else to explore to improve your character and your weaponry. In some ways it's more linear than Demon's Souls, because you HAVE to defeat certain bosses to progress (whereas in Demon's Souls it was possible to skip entire worlds as long as you got the bare minimum necessary to face the final boss), but in other ways it's more open by allowing you to explore areas that you never even NEED to go.The game's combat is similar to Demon's Souls, but a bit more developed. The enemies are definitely tougher and more aggressive, even at the beginning of the game. Two new additions to the player's melee arsenal are the ability to kick (useful for knocking an enemy back) and do a jumping slash (useful for covering ground more quickly). In general, though, it's the same basic concepts of dodge, block, attack. The bosses are a bit less diverse than Demon's Souls' bosses, and more frustrating as well. One particular frustration is the fact that both the character's weapons and most enemy weapons will bounce back if they hit walls, meaning that slashing in a narrow corridor is a bad idea and stabbing weapons will have an advantage. However, certain bosses (and one boss in particular) don't play by those rules, meaning that fights against those bosses are mostly a guessing game as to whether a particular hit is going to connect or not. On the other hand, there are some boss fights that are so well-done and exciting that they make up for the bad ones. One boss fight killed me three or four times, but was so enjoyable to fight that I didn't mind having to go all the way back to it. The game's difficulty means that overcoming a fair boss can be exhilarating, but having to put up with a poorly-designed boss can simply be frustrating.The multiplayer aspect of the game is similar to previous games, and comes in both cooperative and competitive modes. The cooperative mode is achieved by summoning players (or being summoned), allowing multiple characters to fight through one player's campaign. The competitive element is the option of invading another player's world. Players can only summon other players, or be invaded by other players, while in ""human"" form (and being able to summon or be invaded is the only benefit of being in human form), so if you don't want to be invaded it's perfectly possible to just never turn human. Complicating the multiplayer relationship is the ""Covenant"" system. Covenants can be joined by finding certain NPCs in the game world, and each covenant has different objectives. One covenant randomly invades those who are marked as criminals in the game's system (i.e. those who invade other players or break their own covenants). Another covenant exists to invade the worlds of players who enter a specific forest in the game world. The ""basic"" covenant, the Way of White, makes it easier to find friendly players and harder to be invaded.The game's graphics and designs are as impressive as Demon's Souls' were. The designs are grounded but still fantastic, and the scale of the game is amazing. The whole world is interconnected, and it's easy to see this wherever you are. From the highest towers, you can see all the way to the lowest ravines, and the areas are huge to begin with. In many cases it's easy to figure out where you should go next just by looking around in the game world. Like in Demon's Souls, the game's music is limited to boss fights, making the ""exploring the world"" part of the game more quiet and dramatic and the ""combat"" parts more intense.Overall, Dark Souls is a worthy successor to Demon's Souls, and any fan of Demon's Souls should check it out. The main things that might limit its appeal is its difficulty; while most players view it as being ""hard but fair"", it's easy to imagine the average player becoming frustrated at their repeated deaths and having to play through sections over again. If you're not up for a challenge, Dark Souls is more annoying than it's worth, but if you ARE, it's a fantastic game that can be well worth the effort it requires. 9/10.",5,challenging hack-and-slash gameplay,1321056000,"11 12, 2011"

Executing the special moves were a bit of a challenge for me at first , but I relied on that instruction book 100% of the time and I learned to master the ha-do-kens, dragon punches, sonic booms, whirl wind kicks, and yoga fires in no time.  I've acutally first played Street Fighter II in the arcades, but I had no idea on what I was doing and didn't have too many quarters to be waisting on figuring out the moves.  This was one of the first fighting games ported on a 16 bit (or any) console and the graphics were true to the arcades.  My favorites characters to use were of course Ryu and Ken and both have amazing endings, however you must finish the game on normal or hard in order to achieve an individual ending for each of the eight characters.  The harder the difficulty level, the better the game.  Chung Li, Blanka, and Guile were great choices too (as fast, agile, powerful, and easy to use as Ryu and Ken).  Since there are unlimited continues on Street Fighter II, you have the option to practice on defeating your challengers from around the world, plus take on the bosses Saget, Vega, Balrog, and M. Bison (the main villian/antagonist of the game who happened to murder Chung Li's dad and Guile's best friend, Charlie).  I would only recommend purchasing this game for true old school gamers.  Street Fighter II Turbo and Super Street Fighter II are definitley worth your money and more superior.  The Champion Edition on Sega Genesis has a better soundtrack, but I gave it a bad review due to a missing pause button and limited contol buttons.

I had a nice time just roaming around and watching the scenery.  The rides from city to city on the horses were alot of fun for me, but the Middle-Eastern names and storyline made it a little difficult for me to keep up with at first.  I really had to pay attention to know who was who.  Some subtitles would've been very helpful.  (Did I somehow miss those, because I sure did search)Even though there are places to hide from guards, I never saw a reason to do it.  It was easy to kill them in large numbers without dying.  I think the game is too easy in that regard.  I had a few odd glitches also.  Sometimes Altair would freeze in battle while everyone else continuted on.  And there were times when horses would sink halfway into the ground when I approached them, or their hind legs would be stuck out horizontally.  If I sliced at them, they would run off with their legs still stuck in a horizontal position.  Very very odd.This has to be the most redundant game I've ever played.  The first few missions are great, but it never changes.  You go to a city, you climb large towers to open up the area, you pickpocket, you eavesdrop, you look for flags, you get chased by guards, you go to the bureau to get orders, and you kill a major target.  The same thing. Over and over again.  It never gets any harder and it never changes.I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this game.

I'll wait a year for the price to come down.  This game is one of the games that I've been waiting to buy.  After reading all the good reviews I was a bit excited at first.  Now that I played a few hours of the game, I think I can give a few comments of the game.The concept is interesting.  However, the gameplay can be frustrating.  I've never played the first one so I'm not sure if it is relevant to the 2nd Bioshock.The story itself is intriguing.  The controls of BD make sense.  As I first met with some of the denizens, I realized how difficult the game is.  I think the developers tried to make it real by having Big Daddy to suffer damage easily because of the 50's technology.  For one thing, BD does not have any shield and the health does not regenerate.  A single shot taken by BD can easily take half of BD life.  Two or three shots and I have to start all over from the nearest vita-chamber with the supplies lost.  At some scenes it gets really frustrating - I died at least 10 times before I could get past the stage.  By the time I'm done, I lost all my ammo, fuel and EVE.  Walking around with either is asking for trouble.  At this day and age, I think it is ridiculous to make a game so difficult to play.  I play games to release stress from my daily life.  Games like this really take the fun out of the equation.  While I don't deny there are some good qualities of the game, but making the player really work to get the good qualities is just a little too much.Update Feb 22, 2011I put down the game for a month.  Retried it yesterday and boy was I dissapointed.  I consider myself a casual gamer and I've done pretty good in a lot of shooting games.  By far, BioShock 2 is one of the worst game.  It is extremely hard and the mechanics are extremely frustrating.  The logic in how you spend your bullets are ridiculous.  After just 30 minutes of game yesterday, I decided to sell this game.

The H555, while adequate, is not designed for an immersive gaming experience.The G230 Stereo Gaming headset is quite an upgrade to the H555. There is a volume control and microphone mute switch in the cord for easy access. The cord measures at 10 feet 8 inches and should easily reach your system. The earcups swivel 90 degrees to allow the headphones to lay flat and have padding that can be removed for cleaning. The microphone arm folds down for when you need it, and can fold up and out of the way for when you don't. The microphone arm is made of a rubbery material that bends, so you can mold it where you need it. The top band has padding underneath and has a height adjustment, so the G230 will fit small, large, and in-between head sizes.This is the first headset I've owned where the ear cups fully cover my ears. They also do a good job of blocking external noise. The sound quality is good for both music and gaming. The bass is deep without being overpowering and the highs are clear and are not tinny. The microphone is crisp and deep, so I can talk in a normal volume and be heard clearly over gaming music and explosions. In fact, the microphone is so sensitive that it picks up my TV from across the room, so keep that in mind while talking.The box contains only the headphones with no extras. There are no drivers to install. Also, there is no adapter that converts the 3.5mm headphone and microphone jacks to USB. The speakers on my computer is set up in such a way that my headphone jack is on a volume control which sits on my desk, but my microphone jack is on my sound card in the back of my computer, so there was no way to hook up both without losing my speakers. Fortunately, I had a headphone and microphone 3.5mm to USB converter from my old H555 headset, so just note that you will need to buy one if you need to use the G230 as a USB headset.The build quality of the G230 is decent. It does not feel cheap, but does not feel rock solid either. Because the earcups swivel, I find myself being extra careful while removing this headset; the joints feel delicate.Generally, I am not a fan of volume controls on cords. I often roll them over with a chair and crack them, or, in the case of my previous two headsets, the volume control developed a short that required me to slightly move the volume wheel to get sound out of both sides. Fortunately, I have yet to roll over this control housing, but it feels as though it could withstand an impact or two. The volume wheel and microphone mute switch feels tight. I should also mention that the cord itself is long, but I'm using this on a PC close to me, so the cord is a bit too long and can get tangled up easily if I'm not careful.My biggest complaint about the G230 headset is the comfort. It fits fine over my ears, and the earcups have nice thick padding. The problem lies in the band at the top. The band itself is wide, but the padding underneath is narrow and tall. After about a half hour, the little strip of padding that rests on my head becomes uncomfortable. I have to move the headset around a bit to take the pressure off of that one spot. If Logitech had made the padding as wide as the band, I'm sure this problem would be eliminated.Overall, the G230 is enjoyable. I wish Logitech had included the 3.5mm to USB adapter. I also do not know why they chose to make the band padding so narrow, making it uncomfortable for long gaming sessions. If the padding was more comfortable, I would have given this 5 stars.",3,Sounds good. Wish it were more comfortable.,1371427200,"06 17, 2013"

Also note there is a few bonus characters designed by Japanese manga artists and the inclusion of two Star Wars characters.- Build your own unique characters from tons of costume items (and you can change the colors on any one of these items as well). You can pretty much make any character you want. Also you can edit the clothing of any of the regular fighters as well.- Finally be able to play Soul Calibur online over Xbox Live (note this is only for Gold users).BAD:- A lot of the cheesy/easy win moves discovered in Soul Calibur 3 are back and there are some new ones are well. This is really a pain online and worse with laggy.- The story is total nonsense and thankfully be just ignored.- Laggy online, while this is more of an issue with your internet connection if you don't have a strong connection your gonna see lots of lag online.IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- Has medieval theme, both European and Chinese/Japanese.- Not traditional fighting game in the sense that there is no real combos and or supers, and there is limited projectile moves.- Fight with weapons, like a 3D Samurai Showdown type of game or a Tekken/Dead or Alive with weapons.- A 3D fighting game that really uses the 3D space (with eight way run).- Build your own unique characters (pretty much costume only, you pick a pre-set fighting style) and fight with them in Versus, Tower, as well as online modes, (Lots of the new items and costume parts should be unlock to really get a better selection of costume accessories, not much to pick at default).- Have to unlock most of the game content like fighters, stages and items through many different modes of play, which takes time and skill (some people do not have either and will be upset with this).- Tower modes help you earn in-game money to unlock stuff. This tower mode is broken down into two different areas. The first Ascending the tower has you playing matches against the CPU in harder and harder matches and you can save and rest at the end of every level. Descending now has you doing a similar trial but you can not save after each level, since it more like endurance encounters.- Earn in-game money (like in Tower mode and playing ranked online matches) to unlock tons and tons of stuff from new fighters to new costume items for your custom character, or art work and videos.- A new finished system makes it so if you get enough powerful hits on your opponent with our being interrupted you can now do a splashy finisher type move to them, wining the match.GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Soul Calibur 3- Tekken 6- Samurai ShowdownADDITIONAL NOTES:- The Premium edition comes with the game, a download code for more exclusive costume items, a real world t-shirt (with Yoda on it), a mini comic, art book and it all comes in a metal case for save keeping.- There are a few download packs for this game in terms of new costume pieces and weapons, but be careful some downloads for this game are nothing more then unlocks for content already found within the game.

Your character, a convicted murderer, must contend not just with a rapacious, merciless, and potentially explosively violent group, but zombies as well.

Combat with the zombies is more of a button masher, but the drama of the situtation works far better as the button mashing doesn't make the whole game a long running quick time event. Also is the ability to lose correctly. You can make every correct decision, mash every button correctly, and still lose. While its frustrating on first glance, it does add a sense of realism, and adds emotional weight to the fact that you just can't save everyone. The puzzles are similar, in that you are rewarded for common sense.The other characters are actual human beings, and most look to manipulate you or use you to protect themselves, if not just being sullenly suspicious of you and your motives from the get go. The interactions feel fluid, and while you're not rushed, you're not able to just sit and catiously weigh every option, as the game will pick one for you in that case as you make a knee jerk reaction. Voices and acting are also very well done.A few nits do abound. You are railroaded somewhat, and while the plot line does require it, it doesn't make since to bend over backwards to save the guy you hate if you don't want to. The social aspects aren't as easy to spot, and pickups are a bit slapdash. The story itself does have a bit too much deus ex machina, with you winding up exactly at your parents old pharmacy, rather than a random location in town. A couple of the decision points are pretty stupid, such as leaving a safe haven without so much as a hammer for protection, and the traditional horror movie stupid person behavior of dropping every useful weapon 45 seconds after you pick it up. It doesn't matter that you don't have shells, you take the shotgun with you.Overall, a well crafted, tight story that delivers all the horror and drama as effectively as the comics do, with the added bonus of a fwe cameo interactions without feeling like you're following behind the original WD group. And with more episodes on the way and custom crafted trailers, the upcoming episodes looked well poised to do nothing but improve on the initial foray.",4,"Zombies, zombies everywhere, and not a shotgun in sight",1338336000,"05 30, 2012"

The story features you playing as a teenage guy, who must prevent the world from being taken over by this organization called Cipher. Cipher uses Pokemon which have their hearts artificially closed, making them ruthless and dangerous. You must capture these Pokemon back from them by ""snagging"" them and opening their hearts again. As the story progresses, you will learn more about the organization, make friends and foes, and, of course, have lots of Pokemon battles!Unlike the Handheld games, you will not be able to capture Pokemon while roaming freely around the towns. There are no badges to collect, but they do have a gym in this game. This game is very easy, but capturing and purifying all of the shadow Pokemon could present a challenge for you, especially if you decide on purifying a few shadow Pokemon and then focus on raising a team. There are plenty of trainers to battle in this game, and in my opinion, this is the best game to raise Pokemon due to Mt. Battle. The music is very good, the best I have heard in a Pokemon game.However, the stadium mode is, not the best to put it lightly. The game is far too easy, meaning if you work fast enough, this game could be completed in a few days. Sometimes, capturing the shadow Pokemon could be a bit frustrating. You could get their health as low as possible, and put as many status problems on it and it would still bust out of the Pokeball, but that's a minor problem.Overall, this game is highly fun, but I feel that older fans may not enjoy this game as much as I did. Without the presence of gyms and badge collecting, as well as freely catching as many Pokemon as you choose, some fans might feel a little strange and upset while playing this game. I can understand why, but it's a nice change of pace, and I recommend it.",5,An Amazing Game,1272499200,"04 29, 2010"

These games, while fun for their time, played second fiddle to Capcom's Street Fighter  II & its upgrades.So when the Street Fighter Alpha series debuted, SNK (SNK Playmore circa pre-2001) countered by making over the Fatal Fury series, renaming it Real Bout Fatal Fury.This collection cover that part of the series. If you played the earlier games, you'll noticed a huge number of changes. From the graphic improvements to the button layout. Instant of 4 attack buttons, there's now 3 (punch, kick, strong attack) with the 4th. used to switch planes. This makes playing the fighters (esp. those who debuted in FF 3) easier.  Also the games have aged better than the ones in Vol. 1We start out with Real Bout Fatal Fury which is really FF 3 part 2 as it continues from that game's storyline. The 3 bosses are now playable without a code & we see the return of Kim, Duck, & Billy. This game ends with the final demise of Geese Howard (if you beat with either of the Bogard Bros.) The highlight for this game are the ""Round Outs""; every stage save Geese's have a fake barrier at the very end of each side. When it breaks, you and/or enemy can go out of bounds & lose the round.  This is the only game with that feature.Real Bout Fatal Fury Special reintroduce fighters not seen since Fatal Fury Special. (Tung, Cheng, Lawrence, & of course Krauser). The game's intro reminds me of the early part of  Fatal Fury 2: The New Battle  (an anime movie) when Krauser beats Terry senseless. Geese has been removed (he's still in the game as a hidden final boss.  He`s also playable via secret code & there are also hidden extra versions of some fighters). Some of the returning fighters' moves have been  mortified & changed. The Jin Brothers of example began to fight more like theirNeoGeo Battle Coliseumcounterparts. The ""Round Outs"" have been removed in favor of dizzying when the stages barriers have been broken.Real Bout Fatal Fury 2: The NewComers's the best of the 3 games here (the other 2 are good in their own right). One of the 1st. Neo Geo games to use the ""GIGA POWER"" startup (They began bank switching as to increase the cart size limits from 330 megabits to over 700 megabits). It introduces 2 new fighters (or 3 counting hidden final boss Alfred  who is playable via secret code). The game's intro looks like a cartoon, very smooth animation. The rest of the returning fighters (& Geese is playable again without a code) have been once again mortified. Now what I heard, they still have tournaments for this game in Japan to this day. Not bad for a 10 year old game!This collection is better than year's release, yet I can't give this more than 4 stars. Despite adding new features like a practice mode & an in-game skill list (if you ownKing of Fighters XI, NGBC, orWorld Heroes Anthologyyou'll know what I'm talking about.) it still lacks a real 2 player vs. mode. Hopefully they're fix this little issue before releasing the long awaited Samurai Shodown Anthology.This release finishes up the regular Fatal Fury series.

However you can only do one or the other at a time - and the song list is fairly limited.The game is sold with a USB microphone which plus into the back of the Wii system. This is necessary for the singing half of the game. Luckily, it can also be used with other USB systems (computers etc) so at least if you don't like the game you do still get a microphone out of the purchase.You are expected to have a normal Wiimote with a nunchuck for the dancing portion of the game. However, take note that you can't sing and dance at the same time! It's one or the other.The song selection is fairly limited, and only a select few songs are available when you start the game. You have to unlock the rest, often doing things you're just not fond of doing.So, there you are, dancing to ABC or Brick House. By ""dancing"" I mean that you are swinging your Wiimote left and right. Literally. I suppose you could swing it up and down instead. Once you power up your charge bar, you can do a simple left-left-right-right style follow-the-leader to get an extra bonus. And that's pretty much it. Occasionally you use your nunchuck to walk over to a special token power-up.The game has a fairly cool video editing system where you can record your dance moves and add in special video filters and change the camera angle. That part is neat - but the thing you are recording is so simple that it's really not worth it.Why can't you sing and dance? Why can't you do fully body movements like you can in so many other dance games? I absolutely adore dance games. I adore singing games! This should have been the absolutely perfect fusion of the two. Instead I ended up sitting on the couch bored, swinging my controller left, right, left, right. Then up and down.There are so many other brilliant games out there that involve dance and song. I can't really see why someone would go with this one, with its meager customization.As a final issue, the songs are covers, and some are quite poorly done.

At first you'll manage to have some fun.  Then you'll realize that the fight system is rather poor to say the least.  Your enemies are complete idiots and are rather easy to dispatch.  The developers seemed to try and make up for this by having the enviorment attack you.  This is just plain cheap.  And then there's the camera.  Is it too much to ask to see your character fight?

COD 2 and 3 for the 360 were basically the same game (graphics, gameplay, etc.). Then came COD 4 - one of the best looking and playing games for the current generation of systems. The COD WAW was announced...I knew it would be a WWII game, which was a letdown considering the COUNTLESS WWII games that have been made since the PS1 (MOH, COD, Brothers in Arms, and too many others). The major difference with WAW is that you're also fighting the Japanese - something that has always been missing from WWII games (except MOH Rising Sun) which boggles me. I always thought (and still do) that this is due to political correctness. It's MUCH more politically correct to have a game killing Nazi's. No one can cry racism that way, plus it doesn't hurt Japanese sales. Nice. Sigh...But at this point in time it's just plain tired. There is nothing new to offer in the realm of killing Nazi's in a WW2 game. There just isn't. It is time to put WWII shooters to rest unless someone can revolutionize the visuals, or something else about the gameplay mechanics. But why not a different war? Why not Vietnam, or Korea, or Desert Storm, or the current conflict in Iraq. Why always WW2? Hello?Anyway, this game does NOT use COD 4 graphics. In fact not even close. The graphics and gameplay are really no different than COD 2 and 3. Seriously. This game is riding on the namesake coattails of COD 4.

You may or may not agree.CONS1) [...] There are too many little distracting blips, shapes and colors on the screen. Some serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever; some served a purpose at one time (enemy vehicles) but don't anymore (empty enemy vehicles) yet they remain onscreen and are distracting.2) too many command options and options in general. There are too many things you need to do, buttons to press to get something done. I forgot which button to press half the time or pressed the wrong button. Not completely intuitive. The tutorial level would help IF there were not so much of this.3) friendly AI (your squad) is dumb. Previous GR games had your squad killing most of the enemies 5 seconds before you even knew they were there. Now they are often painfully dumb and all of them end up getting shot 10 seconds into any mission. You'll be patching them up OFTEN. I ended up often not sending them anywhere because I knew they would just get shot.4) GRAB COVER. This is a new feature of many of these next-gen games (such as Gears of War). Go up to a wall in this game, you get glued to it. I get what they're trying to do here, but it's difficult for me to get used to. You get glued to a wall in inopportune close-combat moments, can't move freely fast enough and end up getting killed.5) No ""Save Anywhere"" ability. This is a major gripe, because you'll be repeating the same damn thing over and over and over again, and perhaps not because YOU did anything wrong - maybe your stupid teammate did or a VIP stood out in the open waiting to get shot.6) Grenades. Awful. They suck. This is actually a downgrade from all other Ghost Recon and Clancy games IMO. There is little control (uses a color system) over the exact distance the grenade will be thrown and it needs to be very close to an enemy to do damage. Ubisoft (and other games) uses an intuitive grenade system for Splinter Cell, why can't they do it here?1&2 criticisms above are basically that the game is ""too busy"" - and this is coming from a seasoned veteran of Ghost Recon and Clancy titles in general (played 'em all for xbox). But that may be the point of the ""advanced"" part of the title, so the criticism may not be valid for you. 4) Again, I don't like GRAB COVER, you might. I especially don't like AUTO-GRAB COVER (used in this game). Give me a choice to do it or not.PROS1) solid next gen effort2) appreciate the variety of items/vehicles. Tanks, UAVs, helicopters, and you can control them all. They took away things like lazing targets, but that's okay.3) I like the helicopter gunner missions.

When the game came out, it turned out to be an exceptionally well done button masher with a clever little gimmick to convince gamers of all age to purchase figures for it. I ended up purchasing at least one of each figure type and the entire Undead set. Then came Skylanders Giants. It was more of the same, but now with a few new figures and larger figures. I enjoyed Giants, but not as much and I didn't feel the need to purchase figures from the Giants line except Flashwing and Fright Rider.Now here we are with Swap Force. The gameplay for Swap Force is very similar to the previous games. You put a figure on the Portal of Power and use them to bust heads, gaining experience and new powers (or strengthening old ones) along the way. The new gimmick involved figures that can be bisected with other swappable characters, giving you a new combination of type and power. There are a lot of neat new figures for the game and I myself ended up getting Grim Creeper, Night Shift, Smolderdash and Star Strike. I enjoyed the new characters and swap power more than the Giants, but I'm starting to notice that the games are becoming little more than a yearly face lift, with some new gimmick designed to make you not only purchase a 50-80 dollar game but spend at least that in figures as well. it's a great money making scheme Activision has got going and it's made them a crap load of money, but at some point the concept and the extra monetary expenditures are going to blow up in their face the same way Guitar Hero died a terrible death. At this point I'd like to see more of a DLC focus than a yearly game release.As well, Skylanders Swap Force is noticeably buggy with many people mentioning ways the game stalls or outright crashes on them. This is true regardless of system format, but the Wii version seems to be especially bad at this. Of course this being a game for the Wii, it probably won't seem a patch, whereas the Sony and Microsoft versions (and even possibly the Wii U version) will. It's a shame because I have Skylanders for both the Wii (provided by Amazon's Vine program for review purposes) and the PS3 (provided directly by Activision for review purposes) and although I prefer playing the games on the Wii, the PS3 version does run better and has less bugs.In all, I'd give this a thumbs in the middle. The games are fun, but the cost to play them adds up quickly. I like the new characters, but after three games in as many years, I'm dreading this becoming a yearly face lift title in the same way I don't really get as enthused about sports titles anymore. The Wii version is the worst of bunch this year due to all the issues the game seems to suffer from bug-wise, but it's fun enough that it's still worth a purchase for bigtime fans of the game.

The seventh game in a seven part series.Ever since Megaman X4 was released back in 1997, hardcore fans of the series were impatiently waiting for Capcom to follow up on its impressive streak of solid MMX games, I being one of those fans. It took them nearly four long years to finally make MMX5, and when they did, it received nothing but mixed reviews. While it still stayed tried and true to the classic 2D formula, there were a few changes that ended up bringing the game down, such as the lack of anime-cutscenes and a guiding feature that hindered more than helped the game. Despite these quibbles however, I felt that this game was needlessly bashed by other hardcore fans, so I stood up for it. Afterall it was still a fun game and it stuck tried and true to the classic gameplay. Same thing for MMX6, only this one got even more criticism by the die-hard fans. I personally thought X6 was a reasonable game, though the story was bad, but once again, it delivered in challenging old-school gameplay. As a hardcore fan who is open to most games, I am willing to defend X5 and X6 to the end. However, the same cannot be said about the new entry, X7. Read on and see why the negatives outweigh the positives:POSITIVES-For the most part, THE GRAPHICS HERE ARE PRETTY GOOD. Bringing the game to the PS2 was an advantage here because it allowed the environments to be brought fully into the 3D realm with lots of detail. Not only the environments, but also the characters were animated fairly well too.-Contrary to the last couple of X games, X7 ACTUALLY SPORTS AN EXCELLENT ROCK SOUNDTRACK. Nothing real memorable, but the tunes do stay true to the earlier games.-I like the option of BEING ABLE TO SWITCH BETWEEN TWO CHARACTERS AT ANYTIME DURING A LEVEL. This helps when a certain part of a level is too difficult with one character, but the one has an easier time.-Though most of the voice acting isn't necessarily great, I thought that the voices for Zero and Signas were excellent. If you pay close attention, you can tell that the voice for Signas is the same as the voice of Alucard from Castlevania: Symphony Of The Night.-And on the bright side, X certainly doesn't sound like a girl like he did in X4.-Certain enemies you encounter will bring up old memories of the first few MMX games.NEGATIVES-Here is where the X7 comes crashing down: WHEN A MMX GAME IS NO LONGER CLASSIC 2D, THEN A MMX GAME HAS LOST ITS ""SOUL"". What I mean is, by moving the game to 3D, the game loses its feel that most people have come to love. I'm not against making 3D games at all, quite the opposite in fact. It's just that the MMX series was meant to be classic sidescroller gaming, and by taking that away, the MMX games are reduced to nothing more than a generic 3D shooter that already looks like so many other games. Besides, we already have a 3D MM series, and that's none other than Mega Man Legends. I appreciate Capcom for trying to add a little bit of new to the formula, but this has really gone too far.-Also, without the classic 2D formula, the level designs become drab, without excitement.-While there were some places where the camera switched to 2D sideview, in both modes THE CONTROLS ARE VERY SLUGGISH. This is probably what turned me off the most about X7. Remember how X and Zero had smooth controls in all the past games? Well, its mostly gone now. Having sluggish controls is a big nono when it comes to these games because the games are all about fast action, and the game becomes no fun to play when your controls aren't very responsive.-Unresponsive controls means the game is going to be very difficult to play, and not in a good way.-A MMX GAME WHERE YOU HAVE TO UNLOCK X, THE _MAIN_ CHARACTER?? Utter Blasphemy.-What's the point of Axl? He may be an easy character to use, but he's just plain annoying. I cringe everytime he speaks.-Remember how in X6 how they thankfully gave you the option of listening or not listening to Alia's advice? WELL THEY SOMEHOW MESSED THAT UP HERE TOO! Everytime you get to certain points (which is like every few feet) Alia will whine at you to listen to her advice. This is almost as annoying as when you were FORCED to listen to her in X5.-Also, the dialogue moves very slowly and you are forced to sit through everything.-The story has gone so far off track that it's become difficult to follow. So Zero is still around even after X6 where he (*SPOILER ALERT*) put himself into a capsule pod to awaken in the future where the MM Zero games take place? His presence in X7 completely negates those two games, AND THEY ARE VERY GOOD MM GAMES TOO, unlike this one here.-Don't get me started on the bosses. It's been stated before but Capcom really has run out of ideas for bosses. An onion?? I won't even touch that one.-The gameplay can become very unbalanced at times. While Zero can storm levels, it's nearly impossible to use him on most bosses in the game, even the easy ones.-WHAT'S THE POINT IN PUTTING SIGMA IN THE GAME?? Is there some sort of rule where Sigma has to be the final boss in every X game, regardless of how he does/doesn't tie in to the plot? He hasn't been an important storyline element at all since X5, where he was a BIG part of the plot. I just wish Capcom would surprise us a little in that area.While I do give Capcom props for trying to add new dimensions to the MMX series, it proved to be a vain attempt to get a new audience, and it ended up only making everyone yawn. Since it's a bad game overall, I'm giving it only 2 stars. 1 star is too low though because I only reserve that for absolutely terrible games. X7 is still somewhat playable. It's just not my cup of tea, and that's saying alot because I'm actually a lot more open to newer MM games than most of the diehard fans are. They will continue to put down X5 and X6 needlessly, but I believe X7 is where the low point really is. Once the game has lost all the aspects of the MMX series, it's over. X7 unfortunately demonstrates that fact. I hate to say it, but this is where Capcom should call it quits. IF YOU ARE A NEW FAN, AVOID. OTHERWISE THIS GAME IS A WEEKEND RENTAL AT BEST.",2,"Nice try Capcom, but I was bitterly disappointed",1074729600,"01 22, 2004"

2929,79765,A2WOJOAL4OAOR3,B000MF8AV4,Spartacus,"[37, 42]","Before I start the review, I would like to strongly emphasize that I ONLY gave this game 3 stars because it is an exact replica of the PS2 game, which I enjoyed immensly and finished back when it was first released for the PS2. I would give the original game 4.5 stars easy. But because I enjoyed it so much, left the PS2 game in a different country, and paid half the retail price for this one, I am not furious, but disappointed indeed. And this is why I gave it 3 stars.The developers, needless to say as prominent as EA games, invested almost no time or effort into upgrading the game. Graphics wise, it is almost identical. I expected some sort of improvement to suit the PS3, both for the cut scenes, which are alot, and for the gaming experience itself. In that respect, I felt I was playing the same exact PS2 game. The storyline is identical, borrowing the plot from the first movie while the protagonist (the main player we customize and play with) is the guy who does the jobs required for the Corleone family, until he reaches Don status and owns NY (then you're on your own, no movie plot anymore). I did not expect a change in plot, but I did expect additives GTA-style extra missions and diversions from the main tale. This, in a way, did not change. The weapons, cars, execution styles, scenery, landscape, were not altered at all (except for rain, which ok, adds some element). And like I said, remain on almost the same graphical level from the PS2 version of the game. Also, the loading time for scenes and such remain unnecessary high. Comes to show you that the game was not entirely modified for the PS3, to at least attempt to harness its powers. I have played other games that are more graphically-intensive that rendered alot faster loading speeds.There were however, a few twists added. Firstly, the missions are more diverted. Now, besides having the hit missions (where you whack someone for a price), you have favor missions as well, where you go do favors for family members. Not impressed really, because most missions, more or less, follow the same patterns, but ok, a nice addition. There are also playing style changes. This is really the one change in the game I liked. The one I enjoy the most is the crew hiring option, where you can hire members of the family (below or equal you in rank that is) to tag along wherever you go (not in the main plot though of course) to assist you in extorting and fighting other family members and the cops. There is also another option, where you can call onto 4 members at the same time to do the same thing. When fighting warehouses and such (alot of other family members in one place), it gets pretty intense. That is an excellent idea. However, other than that, most other additions, supposedly adding flavor to the game are not THAT great. For instance, instead of just flirting with hookers in brothels, some of them can give you tips (gossips as they call it), that you then act upon and use for your advantage. For example, a police chief could be photographed with hookers, she comes and tells you where you can locate the photographer, you go buy his photos, and blackmail the chief. Nice, but definitely not a reason to play the whole game again (another reviewer focuses on the new additions, so no sense of repeating them again, you get the point).If you have already played the first version of the Godfather, honestly, you don't need to buy this, unless you think it's one of the best games you have ever played. But if you never have, and love GTA-style games, this should be an instant buy for you. Yes it does get repetitive; you're really doing the same exact thing over and over again, with minor to no difference. But what game isn't, especially in this genre?Hope this helps.",3,Replica of the PS2 version!,1180483200,"05 30, 2007"

I loved the previous gamesMarvel Ultimate Alliance,X-Men Legends II Rise of the Apocalypse, and even the first oneX-Men Legends(which took me some time to enjoy)--but this new incarnation falls short.First off, Raven Software, the company who did the previous three games, were not involved in this project and I'm not sure why. That should have been a tip off that something would be off but I didn't think it would be like this.As a disclaimer I haven't finished the game, yet, but there are some major problems that I thought people should know about so they can RENT this game before buying it.Here's the bad:***MAJOR BUG: After the training tutorial and going on the first actual mission from the hub/Stark Tower in the ""NYC-Save The People"" area, once you save the three people, the objectives don't load so you end up running around in circles and you never advance to the next level/area. You have to restart the game and load the ""auto-save"" file (the game creates two files the auto save, which only works in the background and happens at certain points, and the checkpoint save which you do at the ""X-Traction Points""); this will fix the bug and you can continue. I found this out on a game message board. There's another bug further along the game where this same thing happens but I haven't reached it yet. Game testers should have caught this in quality assurance trials and it should have been fixed before it was released.***CAMERA SHAKE AND MANUAL MOVEMENT: The camera shakes whenever the characters move and doesn't have the smoothness of the previous three games. And the ""manual"" rotation of the camera with the ""R"" stick doesn't work most of the time.***CHARACTERS GET STUCK: One team member will get stuck behind a wall or other obstruction like corners and will get left behind without warning; if you switch to that character you'll end up in the place where they get stuck. Not good.***SWITCHING HEROES: Seems like a bug, but since the four characters are displayed in the four corners of your TV screen, unlike the small diamond shape in the other games, switching to the character you want can be tricky as you usually pick the wrong one even though you're hitting the right directional button.***CAMERA POINT OF VIEW: When heroes are running down a corridor or hallway the camera will be facing them so you can't see where you are running to. You're literally running toward the camera and you can't move or change the camera angle. Terrible!***TIME TRIALS: There are way too many time trials to make up for the lack of excitement in the game! And I have it set on easy and I haven't even gotten that far into it.***OTHER ISSUES: Graphics aren't very good; load times are long and the load screens suck; hero management is a pain since you can't switch from one to the other you have to go back to the hero screen and choose the next character; audio sounds muffled; extraction is not available on the ""X-traction Pads"" and you can't  call for help from your teammates. I also noticed that in the first hub, Stark Tower, you can't just walk up to other characters and start talking to them. Only the ones that you're supposed to talk to will talk to you, which is boring.The Good:***CHARACTERS: There are some cool characters and improvements like Psylocke and the Invisible Woman where their telekinetic powers are part of their regular abilities rather than special powers.***FUSION POWER: This is more like the ""Xtreme Power"" from MUA, but it's pretty cool.***SIMILAR GAME PLAY: The game play is similar to the previous games, but not as fun or as good.***INSET MAP: The inset map is still thereBasically this game is a step down from the previous games. Whereas in each succession of the other games got better, this one just seems like they ripped off the last game, MUA, and tried to change it so it wasn't exactly the same game. But this company ""n space"" and ""Bink Video"" either couldn't or didn't know how to make a better game or even an equal game as Raven Software, which has ended up in a far inferior game with many issues then the previous three. I'm not sure why Marvel decided to go with these other companies but it was a mistake. If you haven't played any of the previous games then this game will be OK, but that bug with the objectives brings it to barely to the OK-level.Again, I haven't finished the game but there are enough problems with it that I thought buyers should know about before spending their money. I don't know if the versions for PS3, WII, or X-BOX are better than this version, but if you plan on checking this PS2 version out rent it instead.If I finish it, I'll add an update but right now I'm not a happy camper.UPDATE 09/24/09I finished the game. And I still feel let down. I only played a couple of hours after work each day and that's including the bonus missions to unlock characters, so I was totally surprised when I got to the final battle and then the credits. The story line was not really involved like the previous games and there was very few voice-overs from the characters.The different stages were also uninteresting and when you get to the next level it would just say ""enter next level"" or something lame like that.Plus side is that I didn't trigger that second bug, so that's cool. Again, if you're expecting an involved story line and game play like the previous three games this one will let you down. It had potential but falls short...UPDATE 09/26/09On a second play through there was another bug in the ""Rebel Bunker"" stage where you finish all objectives but can't continue on. This time the ""NYC"" bug didn't happen. If you encounter this (an easy way to tell is if you have cleared the inset map and there's no red on it, check your objectives by hitting the ""start"" button. If it says you have no objectives and yet you can't continue on you've hit the bug) do as before and quite the game and start from the auto-save file. I hope the other systems fair better with this game than the PS2 does.",2,Total **Let Down**! This Sequel Is *NOT* The Equal!,1253404800,"09 20, 2009"

My friends and I got online together and played every for hours...like...30 days of non stop gaming lol. It was highly addictive, even with the faults. With Black Ops, the whole feel is just cartoony and can only be played one way.With MW2, you could run and gun, camp, play with the shield, snipe, etc...In Black Ops, it has completely taken out sniping. Asides from 1 map, every map has the same close feel to it. It's great for running and gunning sloppy action, but me and my friends definitely enjoy the option to sit back and snipe and relax some. The maps are poorly designed in my opinion.Also, every gun is the same pretty much. It's nice working your way up the levels to get better and better weapons.

And since you can't snipe...there goes the drive to get new classes by prestiging.Oh, and let's not forget about the perks and the rediculous challenges to get Pro versions of them. Lots of people don't want to play the different game modes...but we have to if we want to complete the challenges to unlock the pro perk. It's just silly and annoying. Why would anyone want to keep doing that when they prestige?I just purchased World at War, and it's amazing how great the maps and graphics are in that. It's light years better than black ops.

Also to note is how many reports there are of normal STOCK graphics cards melting down.2.> Game play: Piss poor and boring. Enemy AI is terrible at best. The visor (which they push at nearly every rooftop or zone entrance) is total garbage as well.The visor offers information for tactile options which are horrible. All of the gameplay is totally linear and you WILL finish this game in 5 hours tops.This is not a total waste; some of the scenery was actually quite good but it simply cannot make up for all of the bad points.

1155,30890,A1OZZV3HJTHX3H,B00006CRVH,Riomaki,"[3, 3]","The Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 is the sequel to the original NFS Hot Pursuit that released back in 1998.  Much like it, the main attraction is the ability to drive various sports cars down winding roads while trying to evade the police.Hot Pursuit 2, in and of itself, is a good if not exciting racing game.  There is a branching campaign of missions you can carry out, ranging from simple races to delivering cars to playing as the cops.  These objectives help to differentiate the tracks, which are otherwise rather similar.  There is a very good sense of speed in this game and watching your adversaries slam into oncoming traffic in your rear view is something that will never get old.  The physics are more like a arcade racer.  It's a bit looser than the original Hot Pursuit.  However, the vehicle impacts and general feel of the engine are very solid.  The music is also very good.There are a few things that I didn't like.  NFS: HP2 was originally designed for the Playstation 2 and it was subsequently ported to the other game systems.  Every port has its ups and downs and, unfortunately, some aspects of this version make it feel like a rushed effort.  Aspects such as:- No two-player split-screen mode.  Two people can't sit at the computer and play head-to-head.- There is very little flexibility in track options.  There are no day/night or weather settings to speak of.  The tracks themselves, while pretty, are not very distinctive nor exciting on their own.  This hurts since there are only about 4 original tracks in the game and you race on different segments of them.  In actuality, it's hard to tell one apart from the another.- The police have the odd tendency to be aggressive one moment, and then just give up the next.  It's a bit hard to figure them out.- The replay is [not good].  It's almost entirely from the vantage point you raced as, and so you don't get to see the spetactular crashes in any more detail.Keep in mind that, for the price, it's not a bad racer at all.  In fact, I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a better arcade racer on the PC.  And truly, the game is a lot of fun.  I just wish EA spent a little more time with it.  New tracks and/or a track editor would be fantastic additions that are sadly absent.",4,"Good, if not Exciting",1045008000,"02 12, 2003"
7513,95814,AHNYRCBNPYS9P,B000X9FV5M,AeroEngineer,"[1, 1]","This game is baffling when you first start it, what do all those icons mean and where do I go? Once you get into it a little bit it gets better, but sadly everyone is right it is just a go here and shoot/blow this up game. I'm about 30% done.The African setting is the real attraction of this game, it's beautiful and on my machine I can play it all on high and it looks almost photorealisic besides the humans. The visuals and details are just gorgeous, like a safari. A possible minigame could have been either a photo safari or a hunting safari depending on your tastes.There is just tons of area to go around and it is daunting as well as a pain to get around in, but I suppose that's what Africa is like, it doesn't have regular cities and highways and of course there is chaos there most of the time. Still the constant traveling up and down the map is tedious if you are interested in playing the story. There are the bus stations but they are few and mostly on the outskirts of the initial map, not sure about the second area but it seems about the same. The constant driving around large areas back and forth just kills the fun of the missions. In terms of game area per dollar this has to be the best value out there though, too bad they still keep thier heads in the ground with the DRM junk.The map system is flawed and a little too realistic, it makes the game less fun. The resolution is just completely wrong, I repeatedly have a hard time knowing which way to turn on the map since it doesn't represent your direction clearly and is a static map, not like the auto-zoom based on speed like in GTA. I want a HUD, not a map I have to constantly toggle on to find out where to turn to get to some distant objective especially when driving and being chased/shot at by everyone! You are using a GPS reciever anyways, give me the option to put a marker on the objective and have it guide me to it with either arrows or an overlay on my map sensitive to where I actually am on it, using either the available roads or the river I'm on. Use the rivers if you can't use the bus, they are both the easiest way to get around. Helicopters would be welcome.The constantly being attacked everywhere is also another downside, just driving around or walking you get shot at by everyone. I would not want to play this game without a trainer, it would be just too frustrating even with your buddy saving you. I can't and won't spend 3 hours per mission or hundreds of hours on a game. So the difficulty is a little much, if it's so realistic you would have to travel in a group of armed people all the time, not individually or you'd never make it,foreigners especially. The jamming weapons are fine, but why don't the enemies weapons ever jam? Why don't different groups fight each other and ignore you? Is every checkpoint the same group that never sees patrols of the other group? Come on think it through if you're trying to be so realistic. Real team play in the single player would be a welcome component. The bad guys seem to take a lot of damage as well before going down, even to the head with a light machine gun.Also the missions are the same kind of GTA type as well, go here kill or destroy this with a buddy in the middle most times. Though you have to admit that the first game wasn't much different, it was just a true sandbox with outstanding visuals in a time when they weren't prevalent like now, there's actually more missions and more freedom in this game. You can approach them differently though, either stealthy with silenced weapons, afar with a sniper rifle or rambo style, one way or another you'll have to do it rambo style in some part of the mission though. Also I would like the option when driving to have a third person view, it would make it easier on the eyes and not give me a headache with all the gunfire while trying to watch the road, this is a game after all!  The combat is pretty straightforward, no cover system or prone/sneak modes, which is disappointing if you played Rainbow Six Vegas, Gears of War or the latest Brothers in Arms games, using cover can make combat so much more real and rewarding.This game has none of the Sci-Fi themes like the first one did, not a problem though, the African setting and story are fine if pretty downbeat. The different characters seem to be a good look into places like Somalia, Congo or Rwanda: lawless places where life is cheap and warlords are constantly fighting over fleeting resources and power before their own inglorious deaths so the next one can come along. Your role is a pretty bad one as well in real terms beside the initial mission of killing an arms dealer, seems like they'll just be another to take his place once you finish anyways. You end of being more of an assassin for hire all the time available to everyone. But it's a nice break from the military tacticals out there.The lost piracy revenue would probably be much smaller than the peeved fans who won't buy this until it's fifteen dollars, just see the other reviews! So why not make this a rental online for $25 a play through or some other creative way of making it a pleasant experience for those of us who prefer to do things legally, the police don't just bug all of us in advance as potential criminals why should this be different?But if you are looking to buy one game at release this season this should be it, no major bugs or crashes and the number of missions and area are HUGE.

It says only friends & local on the box.This series was started on the Wii & has 3 version on there. They didn't get good reviews there either, this games has SOME personality, but not enough except for a budget/clearance price. The game sounds I admit are good & help & maybe some music, but still needs more from AI, etc. to give it enough personality to keep this from getting dull after 5-10 min unless with enthusiastic friends.MenuThe only thing that works well, you swipe let or right, it works. Confirm or go back by raising hand out to waist level, done. If you walk away, it automatically goes to the pause menu.Options:sound, music volumes & Ready State (a circle with swoosh indicator that any motions is ignored for 3 seconds at each start & can be turned OFF). You can do tournaments up to 16 players & each needs a photo of themselves & choose an avatar. I don't remember any choosing of left or right hand at all. Throwing mid-game with diff hand just moved an empty hand.Games:Real life environments of indoors & outdoors with sounds of people or nature. Ok, but very dull. If you play against an AI, they decide their moves fast at least, no fake AI ""thinking"" though the movements are normal speed. In all the games I think, if you move left or right, so does your avatar, which makes a big difference in say, double racquets, QB, etc., even horseshoes or shoveboard.Hoop ShootThe arcade basketball game. 60 seconds each time. Even at my short height, I had to play sitting or on my knees otherwise it paused the menu. When I threw the ball, sometimes it wouldn't release or I wouldn't grab a new one. Overall the throwing precision was good enough, this is one of the better games. No AI to beat, just high scores.Root Beer Tapper60 seconds again, 3 tables, you step left/right to choose the table &lightly; push your hand fwd to throw a beer sliding down. You lose points if no patron is there walking in time to grab it. Once I found the ""sweet spot"" of how to move my arm (stepping left/right worked flawlessly each time) I got over 300 easily. Also not bad a bad game. No AI to beat.Skill Ball/Skee BallNever good in real life, it's VERY sensitive to the least turn in the arm. Also sensitive to the speed of your throw which shows how great the Kinect is. This game seems to go a little glitchy sometimes. No AI to beat.Smack A TrollLooks like an overly colorful jukebox for Halloween.  60 seconds again, there are several for your hands & 4 for you feet to step on. Quite a workout, doing the handjive & just stepping back/forth works a bit as a cheat, but is responsive enough to know the difference for true hits. No AI to beat.Table Hockey (Air Hockey)Same as real life scoring/play, you move up/down in the air, rather then fwd/back to the camera for better control. Little weird, not as good as real life, but not terrible. The AI is almost impossible to beat. (I even held something in my hand to give a more real life feel which doesn't effect gameplay at all)Tic Tac Toe Face OffYou stand on a 4X4 grid & step on the square w/feet when it turns red, not yellow or blue or the point goes to the other person & same squares will light up randomly. What sucks is that it's too small on the feet below avatar, so hard to make sure you're only one 1 square & hard to see rather then using the big screen up on top. Cute idea, fast-paced but way too poor camera angle. The AI is almost impossible to beat.Double RacquetsHolding 2 racquets is fun, the middle divider is a bit hard to deal with at first, but isn't a bad idea. The camera is way too far away, making judging where the ball is & timing way too difficult. The AI is again, almost impossible to beat. Would be great if camera was lower to the ground at the very least.QB in Motion2 min to hit the targets as they pass by, your ball will be blocked. You also will be tackled by charging avatars randomly, but it's pretty easy to side step them & plenty of sound warning when they do start at you. It is VERY difficult to find the sweet spot of the throwing motion to get it to actually throw the ball. Side stepping is easy, but plenty of times I didn't & they went through me as if I had. Played it several times, but just too hard to find the sweet spot to get it to throw when I wanted. No AI to beat & could have been great.HorseshoesUsual rules to score to 15, works well, no complaints, but a boring game in general. Nothing here to spice it up. AI plays about the same as you, doing well or poorly at random.Bocce BallUsual game mechanics, to score to 15 to win. The ball doesn't roll at all on this weird grass turf, it's like plush carpeting. I had a lot of trouble getting it to go straight though all the other games I had no problem. The AI is a professional pro in this.Bag TossUsual inclined platforms, play to 21, throwing controls work well, AI does well or pooly on each shot.DartsTwo modes: 301 & Darts. 301 rules are the first to 9 & Darts is 5 rounds, highest score wins. You first AIM by walking fwd/back, left/right, confirm & then throw. How you throw works well enough, tracks hard/soft & left/right aiming, I had a lot of issues, I never found control much, just was happy I landed on the board. I did get 5 bulls-eye (3 in a row, no idea how I did that, but I never got the achievement.)Shoveboard/Table ShuffleboardScore to 15 I think, usual rules, controls well enough, AI has a bit more control then you, but not relentless at all.Pool Hall PartyWhen the cue must be placed, where you walk decides the placement. Choosing a ball to hit is done by swiping with your hand. Aiming is stepping to the left or right, then confirm & then do the normal stick movement. The movement/physics of the balls is more like as if you were 20 ft tall or playing with marbles, they move fast/hard, I didn't like it.Puck BowlingHad a bit of trouble controlling the direction, the animation of the puck/pins is sped up here as well, I guess so people don't complain they were waiting too long.Ping CupThe usual clear 10 cups with ping pong ball. Getting on the fly clears 1 cup, bouncing clears 2 cups. You can play by yourself getting more points if you clear cups in a row or whoever clears the 10 fastest against a friend. Like real life, it knows if you throw soft or hard, etc.Summary:Boring style & very little personality to the game, but decent sounds. Gameplay is mediocre/dull, some physics or program errors/bugs. This game brings down the true ability the kinect has. There is something wrong with every game that should have been fixed in quality control or even rough draft time.

Afro Samurai looks and moves fluidly and beautifully, and the game's soundtrack and voice acting are excellent as well.  What really hurts the game however lie mostly in its controls and platforming.  You can't really string together attacks, and the game's platforming elements are disappointingly clumsy.

11882,175654,A2Q2A6JKY95RTP,B004PAGJNS,R. Garrelts,"[1, 3]","I'm going on about 15 hours playing Dead Island and though my experience with the title is limited I feel qualified to provide a review on what I feel is a deeply flawed game.First for those not in the know the basic premise of Dead Island takes place on the fictional island of Banoi. Your character - which you choose from a selection of 4 playable characters - wakes up after a night of heavy drinking to a scene of blood, gore, and chaos unfolding around him/her. An apparent infectious disease has turned the guests and staff of the tropical resort into mindless zombies and your mission is simply to survive. The four playable characters differ by specialties and abilities and skill trees reflect each characters specialty by offering the chance to upgrade specific abilities. It is a system that most folks who play games will be immediately familiar with.The game takes place entirely in the first-person view mode to include driving vehicles. The camera seems to work well for the most part except for the driving segments where the camera seems to be bogged down and the option to not include a back-up camera or view restricts certain maneuvers. It's a bit frustrating but with some practice the driving segments become tolerable. For zombie fans there's an undeniable gratuity on seeing the undead splatter across the hood of your vehicle whilst cruising at full speed.Graphics are a highlight of Dead Island and are highlighted by the brutality of your attacks on zombies. Just about anything in the environment can become a weapon - a paddle, a piece of pipe, hammers, baseball bats, machetes, brass knuckles and the few firearms scattered along too. Your attacks on zombies can crack skulls to pieces or hack off individual body parts. It's amazingly brutal and something that younger kids should probably avoid altogether. Blood and gore will splatter liberally on the ground, walls and just about anywhere else. The environment of Banoi is rendered beautifully albeit there seems to be some sort of hazy filter put over the entire game. Palm trees sway in the wind, waves wash up on sandy beaches and fragments of what was a tropical paradise lie scattered about.Another excellent aspect of Dead Island is the upgrade/weapon creation system. As you progress through the story you'll stumble across recipes for different weapons that you can then create by finding or purchasing specific items. You can for example early in the game create a ""nail'd bat"" which is done by combining a baseball bat and nails. You can then upgrade the bat at an upgrade station by using cash that you find around the environment or on zombies you dispatch. Upgrades affect four distinct categories: damage, durability, force, and handling.So far my review has focused on the positive aspects of Dead Island. Unfortunately there are many, many negative aspects to the game.First, the amount of bugs and glitches in this game is truly astounding. As of this review Dead Island in its current state is better described as a beta rather than a product ready for commercial release. There are numerous multiplayer related glitches including connection problems, PSN friends not populating the ""friends list"" on the multiplayer menu, random drops and game-ending freezing issues that may strike at any moment. In one multiplayer session my friend's game froze 3 times in about 1.5 hours of gameplay. In the last session drivable vehicles disappeared entirely. The only indication that my character was in a vehicle was my floating character in the sitting position mimicking driving motions. In another bizarre glitch my friend and I descended a flight of stairs only to have them become unclimable slippery-slopes that we couldn't escape. This particular glitch has forced us to modify our play style only sending one of us down a flight of stairs lest we should both become stuck. If the glitch strikes (and it has multiple times) then one of us is at least able to keep the game session open whilst the other drops out and then re-joins the game. In short this game is a frustrating mess and I find myself hoping that the game doesn't glitch long enough to complete a mission and progress further more than just enjoying the game.The story while intriguing quickly dissolves into a mindless mass of fetch quests dominated by the nasty habit of the developer to quickly repopulate the zombie population in areas you've already progressed through. The comparison that comes to mind here is to the game Borderlands. That is to say that there are countless ""travel to location x, get item y and return to person z, while killing the same enemies you've already killed hundreds of times"" missions. Dead Island bogs down in repetition so quickly that I'm already finding myself wanting to play less and less.Personally Dead Island is a hard sell. I would only recommend this game after more patching is done by the developer and even then only at a discount price.",2,A Deeply Flawed Game,1325548800,"01 3, 2012"

The map of locations is a lot smaller than the layout of Sacra Terra, so you can get to any location in the game pretty quick.Some of the challenges are tricky and sometimes vague - the very first one requires you to complete a combination lock - seemed to me that they provide the numbers in a very round about way, and the solution was really hit and miss. You can skip the mini games if you wish.I did get stuck in a couple spots, and luckily you can find a some handy walkthroughs online (the in-game journal really doesn't help you).

Its many features were well done. While I would give it high scores in most areas I can't help but think one thing; it's too short.Most of the levels, while detailed, were small for the space they tried to project. A good example is the missions in South America. These were much hyped, but still fell to the pitfalls of the Quake3 engine. Q3 isn't known for rendering large outdoor environments, and this shows when you are limited to moving in small valleys and between steep hills, stuck to one path. While it might look pretty, and it does, there is nothing more to see. So to add length, each environment is usually a string of several levels together. With the player limited to a linear route the missions (and the game) can go by fast.I did like the AI. I think SOF2 has some of the best AI on the PC market today. While the AI in Ghost Recon and Return to Castle Wolfenstien were good, I think SOF2 might even have surpassed them. The AI is aggressive, but not stupid. They will generally do a good job of hunting you down, moving between cover, leaning around corners, using grenades to flush you out, create a smoke screen or blind you, and using dropped weapons. However this is a mixed bag. Even on some of the easier difficulty levels the AI is almost TOO good. Such as often detecting me when they should not (like while I might be moving silently under cover) or too accurate with hand grenades, making it impossible to find protection.I liked multi-player but it was nothing new to me. The random mission generator was a nice touch, but again suffers from being more of the same.Overall I liked it and would recommend it, I just will not be playing it again anytime soon.",4,Generaly good but goes by fast.,1026432000,"07 12, 2002"

PS3 has a fantastic capability to play all optical disk formats except DVD-RAM, DVD-Audio, and HD-DVD. It can also play BD-RE and BD-R including a dual layer BD with 50GB capacity. It can even play SACD. I need to add that PS3 lacks 1080p upconversion feature that most of upcoming new BD players will have. Otherwise, the noise from the cooler fan is somewhat disturbing especially in a quiet scene. It is just like watching a DVD movie on a high-end PC for gamers in a quiet room.On the contrary, as a game console, PS3 still needs to solve problems such as 1) lack of vibration feature of a controller, 2) imcompatibility of some PS2 titles, and 3) inability to share saved data between PS2 and PS3. Until we see enough 1080p game software titles for PS3 and positive progresses in the problems, PS3 will be regarded as an inexpensive BD player with gaming capability.For anyone that would like to have both BD and HDDVD capability to avoid the platform issue, PS3 may not be a good choice, as a BD-HDDVD dual player will be avialable soon and it will initially cost around $1200, which is less than buying two players separately.Net-net, I think PS3 is an inexpensive BD player and a good product for heavy gamers and early BD adoptors.

Once you are actually playing it's fine, but getting there takes 3 minutes or more.  Just to exit takes more than a minute.  Steam lingers and is slow to ""release"" your computer from it's clutches.The game itself runs well.  The engine runs smooth even with my semi-old set-up.  The levels get tedious quickly.  Most of the game is spent running at breakneck speed trying to avoid enemies galore.  On occasion you'll puzzle out of few contrived ways to get over a wall or through a barrier. The levels were fine 5 years ago in Half Life 1, but I'm sorry to say we've seen it all before by now.I've been playing games since the first computer came out.  We've come a long way from Wolfenstein 3-D, but you wouldn't know it playing this game.  Someone else put it very well that the levels are VERY linear.

I was looking forward to playing Chains of Olympus, as this was my first experience with the series. I own a PS2, but never bothered to pick up the two console God of War titles.I've played several PSP games now, and Chains of Olympus LOOKS great. It's possibly the best-looking game for PSP, and as a result, it's a shame that Ready at Dawn will not be making any more for the system. However, that's just about all Chains of Olympus has going for it.The storyline is sub-par, combining a weak understanding of Greek mythology with a tired tale of deception and revenge. However, this is an action game, so story can be overlooked somewhat in favor of actual gameplay quality. The game is fun for a while, but as you progress through the game you earn spells, most of which are useless, new moves and a new weapon. Once you obtain these, certain moves can be repeatedly spammed to kill just about everything, including bosses. At this point, the fun of the game slowly dies as this formulaic strategy nearly always works and is practically required to beat God mode, the highest difficulty. There is no penalty for dying in the game, which is good, but before almost every boss fight there is an cutscene that can't be skipped. On higher difficulties, this becomes very irritating, as it may take several strategies before you figure out the boss' Achilles heel.On completing the game, which takes 4-6 hours at most, you earn God mode and can take on special challenges that are at best repetitive and frustrating and at worst mindlessly easy. Beating the challenges and the hardest difficulty unlock new costumes and a small amount of behind-the-scenes content, very little of which is worth suffering through the same horrible plot and repetitive gameplay for, not to mention that you would then have to play through the game a third time to enjoy the new costumes. I felt no compulsion to replay the game a third time, and I only played a second time so I could unlock everything.Anything below God mode difficulty (the hardest) is quite easy, and God mode simply requires you to perform the same moves over and over again with better precision and timing than before. Some of the challenges are also difficult, but there isn't much of a sense of accomplishment after beating the hard ones, as all you typically need to do is find out which special move fits the situation best and use it over and over again, just like in the actual game. The game itself also contains a few puzzles, but for students of action/adventure games with more difficult 3D puzzles, such as any recent installment of the Legend of Zelda series, they're trivial and hardly worth mentioning, useful only to break up the action.I don't think there's any reason to buy this game until it's in the bargain bin, or at the very least in the Greatest Hits series. Better yet, rent it and in a week you'll get everything out of the game you could possibly want. With no online play and very limited unlockables, the game's replay value is near nonexistent. I'm glad I got it as a pack-in rather than paying full price for it.It's also worth mentioning, for those with no familiarity with the series, that this is not a game parents should be purchasing for young children. The brutal violence and small amount of nudity didn't turn me off at all, but could be a bit disturbing for kids.",2,"Like fireworks: Looks great, exciting for a while, but fizzles out quickly",1219622400,"08 25, 2008"

Best of all you could save your progress whenever you wanted so their was little of the being thrown way way back to the last distant autosave that is the case in games like Borderlands and Borderlands 2.Rage has you basically running errands for all sorts of folk.  The missions were mostly all fun if repetitive.  Ammo was plentiful on easy \ casual gamer mode.  Other than the racing Rage was a video game you could come home to after a hard day at the office and just sit back and kill stuff.  Rage was not a bad game and had the Rage developers spent a little more time improving the drivability of game vehicles in relation to gaming areas it would have been perfect.  If Rage had Borderlands driving mechanics it would have been an awesome game.Also the Rage game space seemed too small.  The open world feel of Rage is hurt by strict compartmentalization of the game in certain chapters that can not eaily be revisited if at all.

I was bitterly disappointed that the game was not a more perfected continuation of what Sims 2 had to offer.  I actually switched back to playing Sims 2 for quite some time before I finally decided to reinstall Sims 3 and give it another shot.In order to enjoy Sims 3, I had to really readjust my thinking and gaming style.  In Sims 2, I loved the whole ""linage"" aspect of the game.  95% of my playing time was devoted to creating multi-generational families.  You can't really do that so much with Sims 3.  In many ways, it's not unlike the original Sims in that it really focuses on the story of ONE family rather than an entire neighborhood.World Adventures furthers this emphasis.  They weren't kidding when they say ""adventures.""  It's not a vacation, it's not leisure time, it's stay-on-a-strict-schedule-so-you-can-get-everything-done adventures.  The different travel locations are really designed for one sim to explore rather than a whole family.With this expansion, I don't even bother creating families anymore.  I just play with my one bachelor sim.  Between nectar making, sim-fu, gardening and playing his guitar, I find that I have way more fun trying to max out all of his skills and getting higher visa levels than creating a nuclear family.  I mean, what's the point of having kids if it will be such a drag trying to switch households once they grow up and move out?On a more technical note, this expansion is slightly buggy even with all of the ""patch"" fixes.  I haven't experienced any crashes as of yet but I have noticed minor things like lifetime rewards not working properly (i.e. I chose ""pay no bills ever"" and occasionally I am still asked to pay bills).  It also does take a considerable amount of computer power to operate.  So be warned if you were operating the base game on bare minimum specs; this expansion might do you in.If you enjoyed or were even luke-warm about Sims 3, I would recommend this expansion.

The two-on-two arcade basketball formula remains unchanged, and the overall fun factor that was a series staple remains unchanged as well.  Thankfully, the controls using the Wii-mote are responsive and tight and don't detract from the core experience of the gameplay, which was personally my biggest fear in anticipating this update on the classic arcade formula.  The game looks good, and the announcer is comical without being too annoying, but that's not to say that NBA Jam isn't without its flaws.  Just like the arcade original, it won't take too long to learn that the gameplay is relatively shallow.

Even better, different types of exercise can be isolated, so when I want to work on my chubby tummy I can just kick into a few of those 3-10 minute routines.

In what I would consider an excellent stroke of programming, even when I'm failing an exercise badly the game continues to encourage me AND shows a little body-outline me so I can see what I'm doing wrong.The Kinect sensor did a great job of picking up most movements, though occasionally (push-ups, for example) I think it just gave me the benefit of the doubt.  What's not particularly motivating to me is at my gross, sweaty end to discover how few calories I've actually burned; but that did focus me on paying attention to what I eat.

It has some original game mechanics I have never before seen in a game and I haven't played a game like this before, you could take off your own head and arms and use them strategically in combat or for the in game crappy puzzles, its kind of fun for a while until near the end or when you finish the game, though it has some major flaws in it which stop you from playing it again in a replay factor,To be honest it was a bit of a chore after the first few levels to continue playing, same monsters, same fights, same gameplay with a pretty crappy in game buy and equip skills, you buy them and you virtually have no space to enable them put some of the skills so you end up with a really long list of skills on the left panel and on your right only 10 points to use them on, you can get more skill points to equip new skills but its near the end of the game midway you get maybe 1 extra points and then 2 extra points then near end of game i think i remember its 3 more extra points to add, its just not good enough should at least be like 6-7 extra points 3x during the whole game  so you end up with around 20-30 points to spend, Iv finished this game i admit i forced myself to play till the end, and I admit it was a chore to play and the fun stopped half way through the game because the storyline was boring, character interactions were emotionless and just had no love between the characters.90-99% chance of the time your character would end up losing a lot of body parts and would get pretty annoying having to put yourself back together every 5 seconds, the DLC included extra character to play online with however I'm very disappointed in this was looking to see if anyone was online to play and nobody could connect to me over 6 hours of waiting to start a multiplayer which lets you take control of a few other characters in game in a co-op or vs not sure I couldn't start the damn thing because you need other players to start it. VERY CRAP I lost DLC money, since this game is crap and not popular nobody probably wants to play multiplayer I was expecting the game company to patch it to let you play it single player offline as well, there is no patch yet so not everyone will get to play as the Immortal assassin or the female characters in the game!

Graphics weren't that great neither was the music or game mechanics, and the monsters were annoying it was same crap in the entire game.There's more flaws in the game I haven't mentioned but despite it all, I could only play this game to find fun in using the right analogue stick to slash with your sword you can slash in all directions but the blocking in game was so lame that I never bothered to use it.last words the game as a whole its as if this game was made by a bunch of noob programmers and boring writers who got a big name like konami to publish it.Why did i play a game I didn't like so much till the end?

This might be a good game for very experienced players with a lot of patience and time on their hands.  The levels you fight through are very long and have no save points.  If you die before the end, you start all over again and have to fight the same creatures all over again.  You also lose the ""souls"" you have gained and the healing potions (leaves) you had.  The height of frustration for me came when I reached the first boss.  This guy is real hard.  Like before, if you die you don't get back the healing leaves you use.  So with each defeat you get weaker and weaker.  Soon you will run out of leaves and have nothing to buy more of them with.  You will have to go on and re-fight the same creatures, yet again, to hopefully get some more healing leaves.  Totally stupid if you ask me.  This game also starts you out with very little health and you die very easily. However it's not all bad.  The graphics are great and the story is interesting.  It also has some unique features like the ability to write/read helpful messages from other players.  This has saved me on more than one occasion.

The game is one of the darkest, nastiest, most mature games ever created and it makes Christianity look like a damned fool. The game is about a man named Dante who is a crusader and betrays his love Beatrice. Upon his return to Florence he sees her dead and watches as Lucifer takes her into hell and Dante follows.The story is pretty good and keeps you interested, but its predictable. The game goes extremely deep in Christian and Greek mythology and pulls out names only hardcore followers would know, but enough of the story let's get to game play.The game has a pretty damn solid combat system. You use your scythe as your main weapons and you have a cross projectile attack. You can do aerial combat, launch enemies into the air, and use your magic. You can unlock moves by following the holy or unholy paths (which doesn't actually affect the story) and each tree has a different set of moves. You can have four different magic items equipped and all are useful and powerful. One of the first elements you'll find that they took away are the relics. They are gone! These really helped you in the console versions, but they are nowhere to be found here. Anyways, the combat system is fluid, fast, and powerful and very deadly. Another element they took away from combat was the Redemption meter. Geez guys why did you butcher this?! With those two things aside the combat is fast and as fluid as it is on he consoles.When it comes to exploration Inferno both satisfies and disappoints. The game has you descending into the 9 circles of hell and each is harder, deadly, and more brutal. Some levels are pretty epic like The City of Dis, Limbo, and some disappoint like Lust (just an ascending tower), and Gluttony (just fight Cerberus and a few baddies and your down to the next level). The levels are varied in length and I wish they would have been fleshed out more. Puzzle solving is pretty rare and when you do get some puzzles they are pretty easy to solve. However, most of the puzzles have been solved for you. Yeah why?! Not only this but a lot of the game's intense sections are videos of game play from the PS3 version. One example is the part when you kill Charon and ride the giant minotaur up the crumbling bridge. You don't get to play this part; instead you watch it...lame.One thing I have to get straight is that the game is pretty epic. Not God of War epic but enough to keep it very cinematic. There are QTE's in the game such as when you take down a minotaur to ride it, take down bosses etc. You can punish or absolve most enemies to get feed your tree paths, there are famous historical figures that you find throughout the game that you can punish or absolve upon reading what they ended up in hell for.The game's visual style is very impressive. Its what you think hell wold look like...dark, disgusting, and evil. The Gluttony level is a good example since you are walking through intestines, bile, puke, and so forth. The Lust level has female enemies wombs coming out of them to attack you. A giant Cleopatra with tongues coming out of her nippies and evil babies...yes its bizarre, but it works and its amazing to look at. However, on the PSP its obviously downgraded quite a bit and a lot of the beauty from the consoles is lost in translation.The game is also extremely difficult even on the easy setting. Wave after wave of enemies come at you from all directions, bosses are extremely hard to beat, and the game can be very frustrating often. However, the game's major flaws are mainly the length, difficulty, and the fact that the levels weren't developed to their fullest potential.So with the flaws of the console still here plus relics, redemption, puzzles, and a lot of other things removed from the game you still get a solid Dante's Inferno Lite for people who are on the go or don't own an Xbox 360 or PS3 (you should!)",3,A poor port that cuts stuff out,1332892800,"03 28, 2012"

Very fun and easy to play, but the background music is very repetitive. The music actually reminds me of the music playing in the movie ""Grandma's Boy"" in the scene where the weird game designer is working on his game and listening to bad industrial music. Besides the music though, be very patient because the game is not your typical fast-paced action of a normal FPS shooter and there are lots of the ""find the switch to continue to the next area"" gameplay.

Every turn involves the micromanagement of every possible aspect of running a society.  You have to decide what to research, what each city should build, if all of your citizens are happy enough not to revolt, what terrain squares to upgrade, and endless other options.  The time system in this game is ridiculous.  You have generally from 4000 BC to 2050 AD or less to achieve a victory.  While over 6000 years may seem like a very long time, when the game clicks off 50, 20, 10, and/or 5 years a game turn, that time runs out quickly.  Even at the lowest difficulty level, your adversaries are given huge advantages over your civilization.  They can seemingly create super units with little or no build time, supporting dozens more units than your civilization (even if they're the same size.)  The enemy's units are harder to destroy, always seeming to win even fights.  Their units can move across terrain features that would take your same units multiple moves in a single move, and they can even run away twice when your units can run away only once.  The diplomatic AI, supposedly more advanced than the previous versions, still demands ridiculous deals and the game never allows you to make similar demands or respond in the same way to those demands.  Game balancing is almost non-existent, in so much as a battleship (of the World War II type) can be easily destroyed by Iron Clads and Frigates (of the American Civil War era.)  Submarines that are supposed to be invisible to enemy units (with the exception of a VERY select few according to in-game help info) will always be attacked by ships supposedly incapable of seeing them.  Your units are always forced to fight to the death if they are the most powerful (but not healthiest) unit in a given stack, while their units are allowed to change their defense to always defend with the healthiest unit in a stack.  I could go on for hours about the excessive, abusive, intolerable, demoralizing, shameful cheating that the computer opponent is allowed to commit in the name of ""BETTER AI.""On the technical side of the game, the interface is unintuitive and generally ugly.  Menus are in strange places, and your advisor screens are nearly impossible to get useful information from.  The graphics are a warmed over version of the Civilization II game, and the sound and music are embarrassingly poor quality.  Response time is a major issue, with late game enemy turns taking 30 seconds to 1 minute per enemy.  Start up time for the game itself is good, and I have not experienced any crashes with this game (patched version 1.16f).  Also, the game manual is large, but uninformative, and the index and table of contents are almost useless in aiding you in your search for some obscure game quirk.Overall, this game is not worth your substantial amount of time and money.

The case comes in two separate pieces and snaps securely to the top and bottom of the 3DS.  This is good because if you have an extended battery, like I do, or if you want to use the 3DS's cradle, you can choose to just use the lid protector and leave the bottom uncovered.  As far as protection, it's good enough to prevent scratches and dings, but won't offer protection from drops.My problem, however, with this set lies with the ""skin"" that's included.  They're cheap, poorly made stickers that don't seem like they'd withstand heavy use, particularly around the buttons and controllers.  These are not the high-quality laminated skins that are sold separately; they feel thin, papery, and cheap--like a sheet of stickers you buy for 99 cents.  It's so bad that I don't even want to apply them to my 3DS.  Very disappointing.Still, the case portion of this set is great, so I'm giving it three stars.  It's perfect for keeping your 3DS from getting scratched or dinged while in a bag or purse, but without adding any additional bulk.  However, unless you're absolutely sold on needing those Mario graphics on the lid, I'd recommend just buying Hori's plain, clear case and decorating it yourself with better decals that can be found on Amazon.

First I need to clarify that I am a Demon's Soul game fan. I spent 150 hours on that game for 5 play-throughs and I am a proud platinum owner. Dark souls exceeds its predecessor in multiple ways. Again I am only 6 hours into so I can only make my review short for listing a few nice changes of the new game for those who were familiar with Demon's souls.1. The graphics look really nice. A lot of people overlooked the graphics of Demon's Souls and now Dark souls does this even better than ever. The cut scenes are visually stunning and the game pictures are clear, with plenty details and just enough lighting. Overall I can tell there are some nice upgrades from the graphics and this game looks better than before. The art direction is superb, which will give you a full taste of what it is like to be in a diabolic church or far obsolete castle.2. The sound is awesome and the music is as good as before. You do hear different sounds when you move around, footsteps can be heard from a distance.3. The game setup is an upgrade from demon's souls. Most part of the game controls remain the same as Demon's souls so you will easily pick up the game if you played the old one. Bonfire is a good idea although I need more time to make a final decision whether this change how much revolutionary (I hope so and for now I have no complaint so don't worry about this making game easier. It's more of giving you convenience than lowering down game difficulty ).4. Unlike demon's souls' linearity. The world of dark souls is more open and that's a good thing. Now I have more choices as to where to go and where to explore. A lot of times you will be surprised to find out you are just next wall to where you have visited hours ago.4. Online remains the same as far as I can tell. The souls from other players online you see in the game now turns into white which I think is less pretty than before. But it's maybe just me.Finally, I think it's worth mentioning that I received the Collector edition from my pre-order and the package did not include physical CD/video disc and a guide unlike what has been advertised initially on amazon. Instead I received an online code for downloads. I am not going to complain about free stuff and this is not part of the review for this regular version. Just felt it's worth mentioning maybe the publisher/seller can do a better job next time updating their product information.Anyway, I loved Demon's Souls and I am sure I will enjoy this one.

The right mouse control sort of duplicates what the 'A' and 'D' keys do, etc.PC users are used to a certain control style with the WASD keys and the mouse where Right click is usually the camera control, etc.I thought fine, it's just a bit unusual so I have to get used to this style.But after playing for a while I realized this is not the case at all. The controls are just horrible period.It feels like the game was targeted for Consoles and the PC got no love with a quick and dirty hack job.Horrid camera. This game leaves one wondering what it is that you can't see.So frustrating that it was like I was trying to lower my head at an angle to see what is on the horizon but just couldn't.Maybe if the camera could zoom out farther and at a bit better angle so I could have a better sense of my surroundings.The game it's self:At the beginning the game is pretty interesting. More nice graphics et al.Then there are these oddities like you travel down a fairly long path only to find a locked door that needs a key.There is no explanation, tie-in, or connection to it leaving you wondering ""WTF is this key?"", ""Where do I get this &^*#%$ key?""Also despite what the gama tool thing says, should actually turn it up a little higher to see things properly.To open your inventory you press 'I'? Nope, you press 'C' and go through a series of menus.There is this annoying little animation every-time you open it up that gets old fast.With any kind of dungeon crawler game I want to find special loot to trick my character out.So I look around scouring for it.More frustration, the bad controls making it a chore to get anywhere, and because of how the world/map is designed leaving you wondering what you are missing.Furthermore when you do find some chest awkwardly hidden behind a wall there is little sense of reward for it.I kept reaching for the 'M' key to realize there is no world map.Maybe not a necessity for the genre but the urge for one is probably do to a bad sized mini/radar map.There are quests but no modern direction indicators too, again wishing there was a world map at least to show where to go for them.The game feels pretty lifeless.  The NPC mostly stand in one place and you can only interact with so many.The AI is dumb and pretty uninspiring.  You move into their trigger area and they run after you, if you run so far they just run back to where they were, etc.  The way they move, how they attack, is all pretty bland.A common fight scenario:I run down a path and encounter baddies. At least I think so, I hear them anyhow.So I pan and tilt the the 1917 Albatross controls hunting for where it's coming from.Ahh there they are!, they are already hitting me having run behind some place I couldn't see.My mage character needs distance to be the most effective.More awkward fiddling with the controls trying to run in a location where I can strike at them with my AOE.I just read they are making a patch to fix the PC control.As with other Obsidian games this is baffling to me.Don't they have any kind of QA, and, or, any play testers at all?In conclusion:Playing this game is like watching a bad movie. You keep hoping it will get better, but it never does.I played for a few hours, did a few of the quests, etc., but just could not play it any longer as the camera and control was so unintuitive and distracting it started to make me feel physically ill.It has nice artwork on the box and promotional materials but don't be fooled.Avoid this game. If you can handle the bad controls and camera you will probably find it boring and uninspiring.IMHO there is much better to spend your time and play.If nothing else, wait a week or two and pick it up at the $9.99 bargain bin.And while you are at it, best pick up a dramamine or two.",2,"Besieged with bad control, lack of polish, and lackluster content",1308787200,"06 23, 2011"

But by far the worst part of the game is that the camera will not rotate with your character's direction automatically. You have to right-click constantly to get a straight path after you turn. This is VERY annoying, especially when the game recommends 1.5 GB of RAM; why make one part of the game advanced and the other part MS-DOS quality? Really poor overall direction in designing the game. At least with fixed-camera games like Sacred, the screen adapts a little to your movement and your character is always in the middle of the screen.

I've logged almost 300 hours, finished the game two times and most of the way through a third.That said, I eagerly anticipated Fallout: New Vegas.  I'm about 35 hours in right now, and while I've enjoyed the numerous story lines and large number of quests, I'm greatly disappointed in the game.  The reason: bugs.  Not the Giant Ants, Cazadores, or Radscorpions, but the glitches that make the game unplayable and unenjoyable.The glitches I speak of involve enemies and companion characters getting stuck in rocks, broken quests such as two Deathclaws in The Thorn just staring at eachother - never completing their fight or allowing me to have conversations with the characters in that location.  I'm sick of invisible walls - areas that I should be able to walk into, but just can't.

It is the most visually stunning game I've seen so far for the PS2.Here are a few things the other reviewers did not quite make clear about the game:0. The way the game merges the tutorial into the game play is excellent and it is one of the best I've seen. It very quickly immerses you in the game.1. The ending is not an ending. It opens the game up to a sequel. If you accept that, then the ending won't be as jarringly abrupt as it was.2. The boy hero is really whiny. But you have to endure the whine since the hints for the next mission are imbedded in the cut scenes. After a while the story and melodrama does grow on you but abruptly ends with the ending of the game.3. This game is well worth a rental and should take you maybe 3 or 4 hours to complete.4. The replay value is low. Once you go thru the game there isn't a whole lot left to do. The 2 player mode isn't that interesting. The game is really more like an interactive story rather than a video game. You spend almost as much time in the story cutscenes as you do in the game.5. Buy this game if you like collecting games- like one for each genre. ZOE is a good one for covering the anime/mechs genre as it really does an excellent job visually.",4,Stunning visuals,1009497600,"12 28, 2001"

For one, the game's main character is not a face you'll recognize from the series. In fact, to start, the character doesn't even recognize himself as you spend the first half of the game just trying to ""find your identity"".One thing that I loved about the television show from the get-go was the fact that, as a viewer, you become very invested in the background and well-being of certain characters. You rooted for them, felt for them or even despised them. With 'Via Domus' I had no interest in who this new character was or how he got to the island... I was just interested in seeing how the game lined up with the world of 'Lost' I was already familiar with.That being said, it was cool to see some familiar faces and to have the chance to explore the island a bit. I thought walking through the hatch, the fuselage and the jungle was a nice subtle nod to the beautiful scenery and architecture of the show. I liked the camp set up at the beach as well where you can chat with many different characters who you love from the show. Sadly, it's overshadowed by a clunky storyline that becomes old very fast.Now, for the Playstation fans: the controls are clunky. You can't jump and it gets a little confusing sometimes on what you have to do next.Overall: Worth checking out if you're a big fan of the series. Not worth checking out if you know nothing about the show. Has it's fun moments, but also has it's incredibly frustrating moments.

Also if you play in parties teammates will constantly be kicked from the group by the matchmaking system and backing out to reform will put you in ""Reconnecting with party"" purgatory a popup that cannot be canceled and usually will not reform your party for what seems like an eternity.

How much you like ""The Simpsons"".  2. How much you like ""Crazy Taxi"".I can't say that I enjoyed ""Crazy Taxi"" much so it comes as no surprise that I am not too impressed by this game.  The best part of both games are the mini-game missions that you have to accomplish.  There are only ten of them in ""Road Rage"" and they are too quickly beaten.  The rest of the game involves driving around a car and picking up various residents of Springfield.  You have to take them to their desired destination as quickly as possible.One thing that bothers me is that many people will review a game after they have only played for a couple of hours.  That is a big mistake.  Sometimes there are certain game characteristics which are entertaining for a while...but then they wear out their welcome.  ""Road Rage"" suffers severely from this problem.The cast of the TV show recorded sound samples to be used specifically in this game. That was a great idea...I think.  Some of the things the characters say are funny and add to the enjoyment of the game.  However, it soon turns into a major annoyance.  Why?  They didn't do nearly enough original voice work.  Imagine hearing someone say the same thing over and over and over again about a hundred times.  Does that actually sound enjoyable?  You're right.  It's not.  I felt like smashing up the TV after hearing Ralph talk about a leprechaun who tells him to burn things for about the zillionth time.  (I would recommend using the ""mute"" button instead of taking this drastic approach.)My rating of 2 stars is for the unbiased game player.

Arkham Asylum is still a great game, and worth having! Here's why.First, the graphics. The dark, moody, atmospheric cinematography is just great. You are drawn into the story just as if you were watching a well done movie. Then suddenly you are Batman, with powerful attacks, a flowing cloak, swooping take-downs, and a real sense of being an action hero.You've got all the great toys to rappel up onto buildings and leap down onto enemies. You can upgrade your armor, weapons, and toys to keep things interesting. There's a combination of puzzle solving, action sequences, stealth, flying, balancing, sliding, jumping, and more. You are fully immersed in this gothic world.You've got a story mode where you work your way through the asylum taking down the bad guys. You are searching out ""riddles"" - question marks - along the way to make sure you explore all corners. The map system is great and keeps you on track.There are also challenges - the typical beat x enemies in y seconds type of activities. So you can rack those up as well.One might have thought that, after playing the 2011 Arkham City game that going ""back"" to an older version of Batman would feel dated. But it's just as much fun to play now. The levels hold your attention, the challenges are just the right balance of hard and doable, and again those graphics and feeling of the whole place is powerful. This isn't a shiny-new spaceship. You're down in the depths of a nasty location, and every surface reeks of the danger and destitution.The gamemakers definitely get kudos here for making a game that stands up to the test of time and remains enjoyable.Are there any caveats here? The game is rated T for Teen and this definitely isn't a game for the little kids. There's a harshness to the world which is fairly realistic. But for older gamers, that adds to the appeal. They are ""real"" bad guys you are taking down - not just pink cartoon bunnies. There's a satisfaction in making sure they are put out of action.Well recommended, even if you're just buying it now.I purchased Batman Arkham Asylum with my own funds for the purpose of doing this review.",5,Still Amazing Gameplay,1331164800,"03 8, 2012"

I am a proponent of realistic fight games, such is why I've always preferred VF over Tekken: it takes true skill to be a master at this game.

Morales,"[2, 3]","THE GOOD: Incredibly visionary, innovative and ambitious game design; soundtrack of the decade; breathtaking world; jaw dropping colossi enemies; simply unforgettable.THE BAD: Choppy framerate; sometimes unresponsive controls; sometimes crazy cameraDIFFICULTY: MediumThere's not much to explain when it comes to the details of SotC. You control a sword wielding boy who takes a girl (sister? girlfriend?) into a mysterious far-away land, and enters a castle of some sort to lay her down on a pedestal. He is told by a heavenly voice that there are 16 colossi living in that land and defeating them will bring about the power to bring back life (which he plans to use to save said girl). Now you, your horse and trusty sword and bow must seek out these mammoth creatures and bring them down.The game basically just has you travelling on horseback throughout this land searching the next colossi to fight. And defeating them will take more than just shooting off your bow and swiping your sword at them. Each enemy is their own puzzle, and figuring out exactly HOW to reach each weak spot will have you exploring their bodies as well as the environment in which you're fighting them. The godly voice gives you clues, some more vague than others but all mostly helpful, then you're on your own, 5 foot boy versus 10-story size colossi. Each of course becomes more difficult than the last.From the very first colossi you'll find yourself with your jaw dropped, and remember what it felt like when any medium first introduced you to something incredible you've just plain never seen before. You'll circle the enormous stone-like creatures, all the while being ear caressed by an orchestral soundtrack so epic and grandiose there hasn't been anything like it since Castlevania: Symphony of the Night for the PS1. A work of art that simply can't be explained in words but MUST be experienced. You'll once again remember why you play video games, and what you love most about them.This all of course isn't without its faults. Anyone who's played this development team's first innovative adventure, Ico, knows what a pain in the rear that game was to control at certain times. Unfortunately, that somewhat loose control scheme hasn't changed much. Many times you'll find yourself slipping off enemies or getting hit because the game's ambitious graphics lead the way while other things like controls and framerates can't keep up. It just doesn't feel as tight as it could be. Perhaps a game of this calibur would have been better suited for the new PS3 arriving soon?Anyway, once you've finally defeated all the colossi, you'll reach the ultimate final boss and the controls unfortunately pick this one battle to be the most annoying. At some points the graphics clipped so much that my character would suddenly disappear at one point and reappear at another point a little ways further. Also, the vague storyline may dissappoint some, especially those who prefer absolute closure. Remember that just like Ico, the time, place, and even language of the characters are kept mysterious, giving the player the option to use their own imaginations to fill in the gaps.BOTTOM LINE: An absolute must buy for anyone who owns a PS2.

601,40864,A2DK2OY6R3WICK,B00009YXDB,C.W. Fitch,"[12, 12]","I've been playing ""The King of Fighters"" series pretty regularly since its inception in 1994, and pound for pound, it is the best 2D fighting game series out there.  The ""Street Fighter"" series may have pretty much started it all as far as fighting games go (and was pretty innovative at the time), but when you count depth, strategy, animation, and flat out fun factor, ""Street Fighter"" doesn't come close to KOF.  The evolution of this series from 1994 until now has gained more fans worldwide every year, and innovation reaches its pinnacle with KOF 2002/2003 (mostly with 2003).KOF was the first fighting game in history to use the 3-person team concept, and no other fighting game (except ""Marvel vs. Capcom 2"") has duplicated it since.  In 1994, all of the fighters were grouped into teams, and they featured several familiar faces from many different SNK games.  Art of Fighting, Fatal Fury, and even Ikari Warriors was represented, and the fact that whole teams (with fighters having several different styles and moves) smacked down with one another offered unparalleled strategy.  It evolved further in '95, with the option to put any 3 fighters in a team (as well as several new and original characters).  The fight combinations were almost endless at this point.  SNK also started experimenting with melding elements from their other fighting games into KOF, and it met with more success.Well, 10 years later, here we are.  KOF is nowhere near the same game as 1994, and fans of the series couldn't be more thankful.  It's hard to improve upon near perfection, but the folks at SNK/Playmore have done it.  The evolution is complete, with the most gorgeous, in-depth, and just plain fun version of them all.  This is actually a collection of two games (on two different discs), as you may have guessed from the title, and there are lots of things to like about both of them.  Once you've played them both for a little while, though, the differences between the two are clear.  The 2003 version is clearly superior to 2002, as 2002 is basically a thrown-together remix/slugfest combining elements from past KOF games, while 2003 introduces new characters, new gameplay elements, and an all-new storyline (what's that?  A storyline in a FIGHTING GAME?).Both games have most of the same features: single-player, vs. play, survival mode (single or team); the usual fighting game features.  But let's get to the important stuff: what will make you want to buy this collection?2002:THE GOOD:--Lots of characters from which to choose (44 in all).  All of the fighters in '02 are from the '96-'01 games, so veterans of the series will likely already be familiar with them.  Even the end boss, Omega Rugal, is selectable from the get-go.  There are 2 or 3 ""secret"" characters to unlock as well.  This adds a great amount of strategy to an already challenging fighting game and makes for some interesting combinations.--The graphics.  As far as hand-drawn 2D games go, it doesn't get any better.  The fighters, backgrounds, and special move effects are all gorgeous and have amazing detail.THE BAD:--Control.  The control in 2002 is a bit less responsive than 2003, which can lead to a little frustration.  In order to execute special moves, you've got to be pretty deliberate with the D-Pad.  Super moves can sometimes be torture to pull off, which is very annoying in a heated match.  Highly recommend having a controller with an 8-way pad.--Sound/BGM.  Considering every other home version of KOF uses an arranged soundtrack (with real musical instruments as opposed to MIDI files, making even listening to the game a joy), it's a  real downer to hear such clunky background music in a PS2 game.  I fail to see the reasoning behind that.  The music is one of the best parts of the KOF series.  Also, even in stereo, the sound effects seem to fade in and out from time to time.--NO ONLINE PLAY!  What the heck is THAT all about?  Talk about a game that screams to be online capable, and it's not.  Disappointing, really; I was looking forward to having my rear end handed to me by Japanese 10-year-olds.THE UGLY:--Difficulty.  In single-player mode, you will not find a cheesier end boss than Omega Rugal `02.  On any difficulty setting above 4 (normal), forget beating him unless you're a champion-caliber player.  The AI in the matches leading up to the end is crazy as well.  Unless you just plan on smacking down with your friends, which is where the real fun is, you'd better know what you're doing before you even turn on the game.  There are no ""endings"" to speak of in the game anyway, so there's almost no point in playing it through in single-player.2003:THE GOOD:--Gorgeous graphics.  This is the most well-drawn of the series.  You almost feel as if you're watching anime when the fighters go at it.  The fluidity of the animation is awesome.  In normal graphics mode, the special moves' effects are also enhanced, and the backgrounds are even more detailed and unique.  It's a true work of art.--Control.  2003 is a sheer joy to play control-wise.  Even though the execution of several of a fighter's moves is similar (a KOF curse from '94 on), the controller knows the difference and you rarely miss a move.  The most responsive control of any home version of KOF.--New storyline means multiple endings.  2003 marks the dawning of a new era for the tournament, as this year the bad guys (from a place called ""His Distant Land"", whatever that means) behind the scenes are starting something even more evil than NESTS or the Orochi.  Each team has what's called a ""good"" ending, revealed after beating the ""true"" end boss, Mukai (have fun figuring out how to get it; it's easier than you think), that reveals just a bit about the developing story, adding replay value.  Some of them are pretty hilarious, especially if you're familiar with the series.--Depth/Strategy.  The ""tag out"" concept is very fresh for this series, and you can also pick a ""leader"" for your team, which enables that fighter to pull out an extra-devastating Super move.  The team combinations alone make for great replay value for a fighting game.  There are 35 different characters to master in all.THE BAD:--No online play.  See 2002.Forget THE UGLY.  There's nothing ugly about it, unless you want to consider the lack of online play ugly.For fighting game aficionados, there is no greater find than the KOF series.  The depth, the longevity, and especially the intriguing characters make this series one of the most well-known and well-loved fighting game series in the world.  SNK (now Playmore) saw something great in the Street Fighter series and basically said, ""How can we make that better?"".  They did, and it's made for a great run.  Sadly, 2003 marked the last time we'll see a 2D KOF game, probably ever.  It's also very doubtful the next wave of 3D KOF games (if any more come down the pipe) will advance the potentially ""chilling"" storyline started in 2003.  There's just not enough of a market for these types of games anymore, but there will always be old-school aficionados like me who've played `em for over 15 years now, and will continue to look out for them.  If you share my passion, you'll not regret purchasing this game collection, despite the nuances.

It seems almost everyone who has tried this game has enjoyed it, and having now played it myself with my kids, I can see why. The game has fantastic visuals, lots of action, spunky music and attitude, and a fair amount of customization. Another big appeal for many players will be the ability to let your creativity come into play as you shred down various mountain slopes. Much like a real slope, you can ski or board down it many times without ever having an identical trip. This game lets you takes advantage of many rails (improvised or placed), moguls, half-pipes, jumps and othe constructions to give each ride a unique experience. The number of individual trick combinations is huge, too, so anyone who plays the game will not only be playing against the computer but also against themselves, as they try to pul off new, unique, and extravagant trick combinations.The game is challenging without being overly so.

I've been playing Madden since it came out on the Super Nintendo.  There have been good versions and bad ones.  This is one of the bad ones.  The All-Pro mode is ridiculously hard.  The ""Adaptive Difficulty Engine"" that it proudly trumpets just allows the game to beat you more easily.  I have yet to win a game using the customized skill settings.  Typically, you will get sacked numerous times a game, no matter how good your o-line is, and you will rarely sack the AI player.  Magically, it always seems to happen on 3rd down.  It's not like you are hanging in the pocket all day.  When looking at the replays, you will often see your offensive linemen just step back and allow the defense to come through untouched.  AI Linebackers will out jump wide receivers to make interceptions, even if their back is to the ball. The defensive linemen have the ability to bat down your passes while engaged, you wont. Your fastest wideouts will jog their routes while the AI defensive players will zoom to anywhere on the field as needed.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't want to play defense for 80% of a game.  It's just not fun watching the AI player run through gaping holes in your offense, catch passes in triple coverage, sack you with ease on third down, run a perfect 2 minute offense every time, and always able to out guess your play calling.On the plus side, I think the graphics are decent.

Using the basic gameplay and graphics of Halo 3, ODST is neat and different in some ways and disappointingly samey in others.ODST follows a squad of drop troopers - primarily through the eyes of Rookie, a silent protagonist. Rookie proceeds through the abandoned, dead city of New Mombasa looking for records of his teammates, who he was separated from. Finding these records allows you to play a segment as another trooper - Buck, the leader, Mickey, the tech specialist, Dutch, the tough guy, or Romeo, the sniper.Rookie's segments are really freeform and open - you explore the city, going through apartments and back alleys and occasionally running into random patrols of Covenant soldiers. The city's AI, the Supervisor, will occasionally try to get your attention by hijacking various city systems - signs will change to point you in the right direction, phones will start ringing, ticket machines will start spewing tickets, crosswalks and traffic lights will change, and so on. These directions will lead you to audio diaries - clues to a side-story - or weapon/ammo caches. All in all, it makes for a really great feel - almost to the level of Silent Hill - and it's backed up by some of the best music in the series.The action stages are pretty good, too, but far more traditional. There is some openness in the levels, but for the most part they're similar to normal Halo 3. This is where the main promise of ODST - the fact that you're playing as a normal soldier - kind of falls flat. You can basically do everything that the Master Chief can do, including but not limited to flipping over cars and punching through tanks. Your health works slightly differently, but it still basically equates to ""if you get hit, go duck behind cover until you recover"". You can get away with running up to Brutes and punching them in the face until they die. All in all, you basically demonstrate the same level of ""super-soldier"" that the actual super soldiers have, as opposed to having to rely on your wits and your guns to overcome your weakness.In addition to the campaign mode, ODST also offers a four-person co-op mode called ""Firefight"". In this mode, the human players attempt to hold out as long as they can against waves of Covenant troops. Like Gears of War 2's Horde mode, this can be a blast with the right people. To add a bit of difficulty into the mix, each wave of Covenant has a special effect attached to them - the ability to dodge grenades, or being more resistant to plasma, and so on. This ensures that the endless waves of Covenant continue to be challenging for as long as you play.The graphics are similar to Halo 3's, but the urban environment is much more well-designed than those in Halo 3. A lot of care went into designing the city and the various signs and objects scattered around it, and the end result feels pretty natural. The sound is really good, too. The most obvious change, sound-wise, is that an injured ODST will pant and groan realistically instead of offering a single grunt like the Master Chief does. This makes it feel a lot more immersive, and is almost worth the fact that - for game reasons - you can heal up really easily and dying's not really that big of a deal.On the whole, I understand why ODST didn't take a more realistic approach, but that doesn't mean it's not disappointing. As a game, ODST is good, but with some eye-rolling flaws that could've been turned into something more meaningful than ""another Halo game"".8/10.",4,Good with some Eye Rolling Flaws,1254096000,"09 28, 2009"

The PS3 version features a few more options, but the final ditch effort for a WWE PS2 game shines brighter than the last 2 efforts that had glitches and and a a not as exciting roster of wrestlers to choose from, compared to SvR 2008. However there are still some things this game left me disappointed with.It's obviously expected that this version would have the best graphics and amount of matches to choose from. Yes, it does. However, the first thing I wanted to know was, how many backstage areas are there? To some people, they do not care and only want to participate amongst in-ring events. I however have loved the fact you could go backstage since THQ's ""WWF No Mercy"" title on the N64. THQ also made the best backstage stuff back in around 2004 in ""Smackdown: Just Bring It"" where you not only could go backstage, but you could enter new rooms from the lobby, locker rooms, boiler room, car park, outside on the street and go from room to room whenever you pleased. When the titles became the SvsR series, the best so far in that series has been SvsR2007 & 2008... the ones in 2011 they have finally tried to put a little more effort into the backstage areas compared to 2009 and 2010. They are a decent size, and there is about 5 or 6 areas you can battle in, but unfortunately they are nowhere near as much fun as that of the backstage areas in 2007 or 2008, and no where near as great as the first of the ""Smackdown"" series. Some new things in backstage areas are cool, like power-bombing opponents into the wooden lockers, or blowing them up against soda machines, but the lack of interaction with with most of the objects and boundaries needed a lot of work... how many titles can THQ release where you whipe someone against something and they just run on the spot with no impact to collide into?  (same with the ring areas, nothing has been changed).For the most part, everything else seems pretty much what most of the other SvsR games have been like. However the controls have been changed, and this time, almost for the better. Now you have more ways to preform moves and easier ways to get behind your opponents, something even the great 2008 lacked... however, I just wish this was included with 2008, as in 2011, so many moves, and I mean, SO MANY moves have just not been included. I understood that maybe if certain wrestlers are not apart of a game, their finishers or signature moves may not be included, so I was not surprised that there was no Hulk Hogan atomic leg drop to find as a selectable move for a caw, but leaving out a standing regular leg drop move? WTH???? Every other SvsR game has had a simple leg drop to choose, but this game they decided to remove it, and only let you have spinning leg drops etc..? WTH? Seriously? Are you kidding me here? What was even more disappointing is the new ""Tag Team Finishers"" excited you into thinking they have made some awesome new double team finishers... but no, they are the regular tag team finishers, they are just assignable to certain tag team partners, but THQ decided to take away some of the best tag team finishers that the previous games all had. Now there is NO Back-breaker & Leg Drop (Tennessee Jam), no 3-D or Dudley Drop, and no Doomsday Device. WHY??????? Why would they expand their double team moves so much in 2011, but leave those moves out? There is no double Sweet Chin Music either. Don't expect to find SCM & Pedigree (DX) either, nor those cool double team moves by the Hardy Boys where they jump off each other. BAD THQ, BAD, BAD, BAD. How could you leave those moves out when they have been in every other game BUT this?Speaking of missing moves, there are so many expected moves in this game that are not present; Kane has no tombstone piledriver, (yes its in the game, but it's Undertakers) for some reason, the Big Shows finisher is a punch to the head, yet the ""Show Stopper"" is a selectable move in Creating a move set, and while i'm talking about Big Show, his character looks nothing like him, both model and in game picture. It's like instead of designing him, they created him in their CAW and set it to his default look, yet they put him on the cover of the game???. Many more moves like The Jacknife Powerbomb (Kevin Nash), Full Nelson Choke Slam (Brian Adams), Abdonmal Stretch Slam (Crush),  Top Rope to Outside Choke Slam, Diamond Cutter and regular head scissors are not present in this game. WTH THQ????? Those moves are not even creatable in the create a finisher options.Creating a Wrestler has not been improved much, it's pretty much the same ole', same ole' junk from the past few games. A couple of useless things added here and there, and a few of the old WWE logo's from past games not included to make way for the newer guys, so no ""Two Words Suck It"" for the reverse side of shirts, but you can have unreadable ones instead. THQ obviously put very little effort into improving the CAW looks, as so much stuff looks nice and 3D with the clothes and body, face paint etc... but then you get blurry pixelated WWE logos to slap on shirts, that just make the graphics seem poor because THQ slapped together something that resembles the WWE logos by using MS Paint, and thinking they are good enough to slap on more higher resolution attires.Well, I have powerslammed a lot of this game so far, so let's see what pros we can talk about. The Elimination chamber matches have had a glitch in them since 2009, and continued in 2010 where you could not climb the turnbuckles, which prevented you from climbing to the top of the cells; well they finally rectified that problem and you can once again play the match properly. Inferno matches have had an update to the way you win, however I would prefer to just drag an opponent to the sides, the controls of how this version is won is a bit confusing. Hell in a Cell has been made bigger, not better, but different. The cage is much larger, and you can now grab weapons from under the ring. However the cage door has been removed, so you can't walk in or out. But you can preform a finisher through the cage wall to escape to get to the top of the cell. The top of the cell still has two plates you can break through, and now you can throw your opponent off the roof and into the tables below... no more jumping off and missing completely either. Ladder matches have a much better way of winning now imo. No more wearing down a slow bar, it's a matter of timing on pulls to grab it.In Exhibition modes, you also get random little cut scenes where one opponents might attack the other from behind before the match. Allowing you to start the match possibly with a finisher ready. This can be good, if you get the finisher, or bad if your opponents gets it first. Exhibition mode also runs through as a roster event, it is confusing at first, but easy to figure out. Pointless tho. Apart from it's how you unlock certain wrestlers by playing what match is assigned on the show. Royal Rumble matches have had a few little changes to the way eliminations occur, mostly button mashing selected buttons, but now with finishers for an easy elimination. However, back to a con, you can't select the rules for Rumble Matches, it's over the top or the highway. Why can't we select pinfalls and submissions? Or even turn off the over the rope eliminations? You'd think when you see ""Match creator"" you would be able to adjust those rules? Nope. Not to mention backstage areas are by KO only as usual. Is it asking so much to be able to customize those rules to make our own fun THQ? You haven't gotten that right since ""WWF No Mercy"".Another con is the arena areas, even tho there is about 15 or so, they all seem the same. They either have a lot of spectators, or a lot of empty seats. But every environment, including the stage area seems exactly the same until you get out of the ring and the angle changes to face the stage, and even then, it just seems like an altered gif playing on the stage screens. The only one that seems different is the Tribute To The Troops arena, which is outdoors, but you only see the sky on certain camera angles, and there is army mesh around the ring with the troop uniform spectators. Which look pathetic and very low resolution. When you play certain matches, foreground objects obstruct your view of the ring.Road To Wrestlemania is not much different to past games, but it has been improved. You walk around backstage and can enter a few rooms, find sub-missions and progress through 3 months of matches (about 20 in total including side missions), but as usual, there are 4 wrestlers to choose to compete in there RTWM story, or if you choose ""against Undertaker"" you can select your caws or a few other superstars and attempt to beat Undertaker at Wrestlemania and break his streak. Personally, not something I ever wanted to do, and know it will never happen, so why play it?Finally some legends have been included once again. Not just one or two, The Rock finally comes back to Smackdown, Stone Cold has arrived once more to raise some hell, and new inclusions are Jake The Snake Roberts, Jimmy Snukafly, Sabu, Terry Funk, Paul Bearer (manager only) & Rob Van Dam. What annoys me the most tho, Bret Hart is an exclusive character to some versions of the game if you pre-ordered it at the time from certain places. WTH??? He was in 2008, why make him exclusive to ... forget it THQ, you bungled so much with this and other games so far, why would you stop there? You can't even make a decent CAW of him. Pathetic THQ. Just Pathetic. No consideration for fans in the future, just forget the current and work on the next and expect more $$$.You can now create finishing moves from a standing position, corner, and new to this game, top rope moves... again, they are limited to pretty much what you can already do in the game, you just can't seem to really make the ultimate moves you desire.Overall, this is the best Smackdown vs Raw since 2008. But you also had to take the good with the bad... in many ways, had this game here included the backstage areas of 2008 and had more legends or allowed you to create better looking legends, it could have been a 5 star game. But I can only give it 3 and a half. Thanks for the last effort for the ps2 THQ, but you could have made it so much more entertaining.",3,Finally.... The Rock.... has come back to..........

11899,4390,A1KA46P9TRPIX7,B0000296O5,John,"[1, 3]","as you might have heard, this game was downright terrible. the only thing that kept me going was the story. in my personal opinion, the story is very exceptional and the many months of work they put into it paid off. before starting, i would like to comment that i was very excited to get this game after the two-in-a-row masterpieces final fantasy 6 and 7, and for the fact that it was created by squaresoft, but i was extremely disappointed after about one hour of gameplay. now onto the review...STORY: 9/10as you have most likely heard, people say that this storyline is based on the theme of love, when in many people's opinion (my own included), this game is anything BUT love. the only thing close to love that happens is **SPOILER**rinoa and squall kiss at the ending**END SPOILER**which really isnt all that loveable in my opinion.similar to final fantasy VII, the setting is in the future (irritating downside, as insanely advanced technology is not that fantasy-like), but this is a mediocre downside of the gameThe story goes pretty much like this: an evil sorceress is on the verge of enslavement of the world and a resistance to defeat this woman called Garden trains military soldiers called SeeDs to battle against her and her troops. pretty lame sounding, as seed and garden are really actually one of those ideas that a first grader could come up with in about 5 minutes, but the story actually picks up at about disk three (yes it is pretty slow).SOUND AND MUSIC 6.5/10the sound is really quite good in this game. squall's sword slashes when hitting a target, quistis's whip cracks when snapping at a target, and Zell's mighty fists make smacking noises when hitting a target.such as final fantasy VII, the music in here is not that well conceived and memorable such as the earlier final fantasys. the boss music is sort of catchy (once again such as final fantasy VII), but the rest of the music is rather annoying.GAMEPLAY 2/10the single thing that totally MAULS this game is the gameplay. the battling is terribly tedious, and the magic system is completely raped of its glory. instead of learning magic abilities, now you waste time &quot;drawing&quot; magic from enemies. another terrible mistake squaresoft made while making this game.a new addition to the gameplay is the Guardian Forces (GF) which are pretty much summons just in a stupid term. these guardian forces are pretty much the only thing that will keep you alive in this game, as you need them to enhance health, strength, and so on, which i will get to in a moment. the guardian forces are the main attack force, and with these forces there is barely any need for the &quot;attack&quot; command (other than Zell's Duel limit break). The animations for guardian forces are well animated, but EXTREMELY long and tedious.Limit breaks are the only other useful thing in this game, but unfortunately, they can only be accessed when you are in life-threatening situation, completely aboliting the well-conceived limit break bar.MENUS AND PUT-TOGETHERS 1/10this is terribly time-consuming and irritating. the menu is where i spent most of my time on this game. gladly, squaresoft got rid of the horrid materia system and added on the god-how-could-this-get-any-worse junction system. this system takes about a half of an hour just to understand, and then you spend even more precious hours of your life drawing magic upgrading it so a boss cannot kill you in just one blow. for example, you have to spend about an hour drawing 100 lifes from an enemy just so you can raise your health a couple thousand points.then after this boring proccess you must draw 100 Tornados in order to raise your attack power (I am almost completely CERTAIN this process is required to defeat the final boss)The second complete worst part of this game is the following: THERE IS NO LONGER AN EQUIP OPTION! what happened to equipping weapons and armor? there is a way to upgrade your weapon, but that consumes serious time and involves ridiculous side-quests that are extremely boring. dont even bother going through the stress of completing these questsa ridiculous thing they did in this game is that the characters level up with you, so you can finish the game at level 8 or so (as leveling up is not necessary and bosses give you NO experience points{I completed it at level 7 or 8})GRAPHICS 9.5/10The best part of the game, the graphics. The FMV scenes are superior to every other graphics i have EVER seen in my entire life-span (yes including ps2 graphics), and even during gameplay the graphics are superior (during gameplay they are worse than ps2 graphics i might add), and the only flaw in them is the pixelations, as the characters look a bit fuzzy. but that problem is solved in FFIX.You remember the disgustingly distorted characters in FFVII? well, thank god, they are replaced with actual human-like figures that look like HUMANS at last. no more stubby oversized arms and legs with huge heads that remind me of cartoons.there is only one thing i love about this game, and it is the ending. as i said before, the story is VERY good and is the only reason that i gave it 2 stars instead of 1. the ending is EXTREMELY good (not as good as FFVI's though) and made me feel good.REPLAY VALUE: 0/10as many other people have done, as soon as i finished wasting my time playing this game and finally destroyed the final boss i took out the disk from my playstation, placed it in its case, placed in on a shelf behind my other cds, and it has not been touched ever since. this game was terrible, and i wish i had my 30 hours of gameplay back. i say instead of even thinking of buying this game, look for final fantasy anthology and final fantasy 6 instead.",2,"Worst in the series, get final fantasy anthology instead",1086220800,"06 3, 2004"

Think along the lines of God of War II; it has different fighting styles and blocking system,  but it also incorporates the same ""mini-game"" type of play: during boss battles, etc. The fighting styles have a ranged attack, fast style, and strong style. To block all you have to do is be in the right style. If you're having arrows fired at you, go to the ranged stance to send your blades whirling around you to deflect them.I showed this game to one of my friends recently and he had a blast. Using the Six-axis was a nice addition when doing ""Aftertouch."" For instance, when the 2nd character that you play uses her ""bow"" you fire the arrows and then guide them with the PS3 controller. This takes some getting used to, but is fun. The main character of Heavenly Sword can use Aftertouch when throwing things (or firing from a cannon), which includes bodies.The voice acting and cutscenes are great.

And it fails on both.In terms of gameplay what you have here is an vapid linear blaster with very little in the way of truly challenging moments. It's a 'corridor' romp which provides little to no room to explore your surroundings and invisible walls and impenetrable foliage prevent any sort of chance to leave the devs' intended path. And each level is sprinkled with just enough leaps of faith and death drops to make the going tediously annoying but not actually hard. Frustrating yes, but not rewarding in any sort of sense of achievement. When you have 3D jumping platformer you must be able to see where your character is going to land and with Alice:MR most of the time you can't and it's often pure luck that she hits the silly mushrooms that you're attempting to leap onto. The enemies that you face are predictable and repetitive and can be offed with little more than a few dodges and your pepper grinder. If you see an open area then guess what... you're going to be locked in the room until you deal with exactly the same bad guys that you just killed in the previous locked-off area a mere two minutes ago. Yawn.But by far the biggest criminal here is the camera. Have we really got to 2011 and still have to fight with the camera? There are inexplicable moments in A:MR when the camera locks off or jumps around to show you the action from 180 degrees causing Alice to about-turn and run back the way she came without you actually moving the control stick! It's unforgivable.The story - well what story? The V/O acting was strange and unpleasant and the Cheshire pops up to mumble a few lines which for the most part was unintelligible. The memories you collect (an excuse to get off the rails that the game puts you on) offer nothing to the proceedings. Frankly I had no clue what was going on. There's no narrative, no arc and no point.Graphically things fare a little better thankfully and in many parts, especially the cut scenes, it reminded me of Tim Schaffer's Psychonauts and that's no bad thing. Of course it had to be spoiled with lazy blurry, pop-in textures and clipping errors a plenty. A month of code tweaking could have fixed it but the devs probably hoped we'd think it was all part of the styling of the game's look. I wasn't fooled.A mediocre attempt at regaining previous glory and one that will be at budget price-point within a few weeks.

This game has graphics as great as Tools of Destruction.  It also features the same funny dialogue and top notch voice acting we've come to expect.  Captain Qwark is among my all-time favorite game characters and is hilarious as always here.  Unfortunately, the tools in this game are largely repeats of what we've seen since the first installment.  A pistol and grenades are offered early, but most good weapons are withheld until fairly late in the game.  One powerful weapon, gun turrets, is gone completely, which substantially increases the difficulty.  The best weapon/gadget in video game history, the Groovitron, thankfully came back and never gets tired.  My favorite new weapon is the Rift Inducer 5000, which opens a portal to another dimension, allowing a monster to reach out its tentacles and gobble up any enemy in its vicinity.  I also like the MagNet, an electrified net that automatically locks on its target.  The rest of the weapons are basically rehashes with slight tweaks, and the need to level them all up is a real chore.  Mr. Zurkon is your synthenoid bodyguard, but his one liner taunts get old after a while.  When it came to throwing grenade type weapons, I had lots of trouble aiming; in some cases they went sailing off to the side for no reason at all instead of simply going where I was facing (and where my intended target stood).  Ratchet and Clank are separated for the bulk of the game and alternate missions.  The Clank missions feature awkward fighting and repetitive, unimaginative puzzles.  I couldn't end them fast enough.  Qwark accompanies Ratchet early, but unfortunately it doesn't last long.  The comic relief he provided would have greatly aided in spicing up the repetitive, mindless shooting and shaky platforming.  Far too many times I fell to my death because the game threw me off trajectory during a jump and made me land short of a platform through no fault of my own.  The swingshot likewise failed to deploy at completely random times and led to bug based deaths, including multiple times during one boss fight.  It was terribly frustrating and really took away from the fun factor, especially since I never had these problems in previous titles.  While the characters and story development are as brilliant as ever, this series needs to really look to the future and stop being so redundant.  A game where you primarily play as Captain Qwark would be a comedic gold mine and could offer a chance to fundamentally change the gameplay and breathe fresh air into the series.  This game stands fairly well on its own, but R&C veterans have been here a half dozen times now, and the formula is tired.  Add in the first case of shoddy platforming in the entire series, and I was very disappointed.

While I like to game, much of this time is instead related to data analysis for my job.  I have used the G9x mouse for a while and it is nearly perfect.It has a wire.  This is an obvious point, but there are some fierce battles over whether current technology has taken away the latency advantage of wired mice for gaming and thus made them obsolete.  I understand that viewpoint, but I use wired peripherals to avoid adding noise to our equipment.  The wire with this mouse is thin enough to not interfere, but doesn't feel so flimsy that it will stop working, and I've abused it with no issues.The ability to change the DPI of the mouse quickly on the mouse itself is wonderful.  I tend to use the higher settings to avoid needing to pick up the mouse during large movements, but when I let someone else use my computer, they feel like it is flying out of control.  Now, I can quickly adjust the DPI down for them.  Also, the software allows the DPI to automatically switch based on context, which might come in handy for games or applications in which different tools or views require varying speed or precision.I may be strange, but I like a narrow grip with a light weight.  I find this gives me the best control with the least hand fatigue.  Nice gamer mice are often wide grip and heavy, which is why I give up on them after a while.  With this mouse, both weight and grip are easily changed.  I really like that, though the grips feel a bit too much like sandpaper.  Speaking of customization, profiles can be saved to the mouse, so you don't need to install the software if you want to plug the mouse in to a different PC and be ready to go.  The software is needed for more advanced features like macros, though.If you have not tried the Logitech mouse wheel technology (Microgear), I suggest picking up one of their mice that has it.  It allows smooth, fast scrolling, which may admittedly be more important for web surfing than for gaming.  It has been around for years and it is hard to go back to a mouse without it.There aren't many bells and whistles or shiny aesthetic touches to the G9x.  I find it disappointing that the MW3 version has a logo printed on top, rather than a thoughtful styling that would make it really unique.  The mouse pad is not very interesting either.  However, if you are a fan of the game, you will likely enjoy it.  It is a wide style pad, so it will take up more space than the small standard size mouse pads.The G9x, whether in MW3 dress or standard, is a simple mouse that works extremely well.

X attacks, Y breaks your opponent's shield. Those are the only buttons you really need to know.

12373,215483,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B00B67ZS3U,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[8, 11]","How do you pitch an SRPG in this day and age? Nintendo had a difficult time figuring that out earlier this year, opting to print limited copies of ""Fire Emblem: Awakening"" and pushing for people to buy the digital version. Doing a physical release for a niche type of game is definitely a risky prospect, and more often than not, it doesn't pay off. Unless, of course, the game has a special gimmick. And if that special gimmick is taking major characters from three legendary video game giants and throwing them all into an arena, then you have a fighting chance at success. Enter ""Project X Zone"" (pronounced ""Project Cross Zone""), a funny and frantic experience that houses some of the best strategy gameplay in years.The plot kicks off... uh, well. Yes, there is a plot, but it barely makes any sense. Somehow, portals to different worlds are getting opened, and through these portals slip video game characters. These characters meet and take on each others' foes, along with meeting new enemies, and they... well, they interact... and there's something about time travel? To be perfectly honest, the actual narrative here makes barely any coherent sense, and if you're looking for an emotionally engaging and thought-provoking time, you might want to look elsewhere, because you will find none of that here.But that's actually not a knock on the game, surprisingly, because you won't be buying this for the story. You'll be buying it to watch Dante from ""Devil May Cry"" team up with Arthur from ""Ghosts and Goblins"", and talking about slaying demons. To see Gemini from ""Sakura Wars"" struggling to understand what an online game is when meeting "".hack"" characters, or to see Mega Man... well, see Mega Man do anything, since his franchise is being kicked in the teeth right now (a fact PXZ references rather bluntly.) What you're buying is over 200 characters from a huge variety of franchises being set loose and forced to interact in chaotic situations. And yes, this is as beautiful as it sounds.And that's thanks to some truly clever writing that respects the characters, and elevates the dialogue and interactions beyond typical shallow levels. Untold amounts of effort went into preserving the tone and respecting the legacy of every franchise at play here. Even characters who haven't been getting a lot of love as of late are treated as more than cynical cash grabs, their personalities and experiences intact. There are countless in-jokes that poke fun at fans' favorite franchise moments, and several characters that directly reference events from past games, their travels fueling conversations with other characters. There are some truly unnatural and poorly done crossovers out there, but this is not one of them. Instead, the respect paid to these legacies is truly impressive, equaling the amount of love put into the ""Smash Brothers"" franchise.What also prevents this game from falling into the slump most crossovers do is the gameplay. As astounding as it may sound, it actually drives the core experience so much that people who know nothing about the characters might even enjoy it. It can be described as an SRPG meets turn-based JRPG with elements of fighter and brawler thrown in for good measure. Players traverse maps taken from various games' levels (my personal faves are the faithfully-recreated ""Dead Rising"" and "".hack"" boards), doing so on a grid-based system much like ""Final Fantasy Tactics"" or ""Fire Emblem."" But the similarities stop there, because the battle system here is fast, fresh, and, most importantly, fun.Attacking an enemy instigates a battle which looks like a screen of a typical fighter game. From there players are expected to build combos with a combination of the face buttons and D-Pad/Analog Stick, combos that build up a special meter over time. When the special meter fills, a cinematic and over-the-top move activates, dealing massive damage. Also featured is a robust and impressive support system. Characters move in pairs, but a bonus unit can be tacked on and activated by the L button, dealing extra damage. More crazy still is the ability to call in support from units that are in the immediate vicinity with the R button, which leads to even more crazy combos. At a given point, a player will be able to have a whole swarm of allies on the screen, wailing away on an enemy in a chaotic frenzy, before unleashing a huge finishing blow. It's frantic fun, and while you might not be able to always know what's going on, you'll have fun doing it.The game is a graphical treat as well, with beautiful and polished sprites that bring to mind some of the most high-end SNES and 2D PSone games, all set on top of some well-drawn and cleverly-designed boards. Everything's also very colorful too, so it's certainly a feast for the eyes, and no two places really run together. Sprites on the board are cute and stout, but the real prowess of the animators is shown in battle, with animations that are elaborate and incredibly impressive, especially considering the difficulty with handling so many characters in one game. Yet somehow, no two movesets look alike, and everyone has their own distinct aura about them. Top it off with some really in-depth 3D effects, and you've got a winner in the graphics department, setting a standard for how to do 2D right on the 3DS.While the game has its own musical tracks, and pretty good ones at that, the true highlights are the loving renditions of character and game themes that sound amazingly crisp, considering that they're all jammed onto one little cartridge. This includes an incredibly composed version of Ryu's theme from ""Street Fighter"", and a new instrumental take on the ""Sakura Wars"" series themes, among many, many others. The only slightly irritating thing is the lack of an English vocal track. While I do love the Japanese voice actors, and realize the cost of casting new people would have been risky, it would have been cool to hear new takes on characters who have never spoken in English. Aside from that gripe, though, the sound in this game is routinely great.Typically, a game devoid of a cohesive plot would put something at risk of not being great, but this case is one of the rare exceptions. Driven by the characters and their interactions, this game makes a case for crossover games, a sub-genre that is typically looked upon with disdain in the gamer community. Nothing really feels out of place here, and the silly plot, while pretty wacky, isn't necessarily bad; it's just an excuse to bring all of these beloved characters together. Furthermore, the gameplay is brilliant, and leaves this year's only other competitor on the 3DS, ""Fire Emblem: Awakening"", far behind in the dust.Sure, this game might not be for everybody. Its bizarre story, intricate gameplay, and frantic action could possibly be a turn-off. But for those who adore rich strategy, funny dialogue and gameplay that you can really sink your teeth into, it's definitely a winner. One of the most memorable gaming experiences in recent memory, ""Project X Zone"" is a must-have if you love any of the characters involved, or if you just want a great SRPG.Plot: 8Gameplay: 9.5Graphics: 9Sound: 9.5Overall: 9NOTE: This game marks the first time that certain characters from the ""Sakura Wars"" franchise have been playable in an overseas game.

11194,119883,AFL04X8D4TDG8,B001PU8MVS,"Grady P. ""The Mock Turtle""","[2, 4]","The Munchables is a hard game to write about. It's definitely quirky, which becomes immediately clear just by looking at the boxart. The problem is, despite being enjoyable enough, I felt so conflicted while I was playing it, which is extremely odd for me. Either I know I like a game or not (and regardless, I'll stick it out), but The Munchables had me constantly tipping from one extreme to the other.As you might have guessed, the game's premise is bizarre: on the planet Star Ving lives a species of creature called Munchables, who love nothing more than to eat anything and everything, all day, every day. Their land is a harmonious one, led by the Great Elder, the planet being made up of a series of islands connected by rainbows. That all changes one day when evil space pirates known as Tabemon Monsters invade and steal their sacred jewels. While the Great Elder is greatly chagrined by this, the two star Munchables, Chomper and Munchy, see the invaders as nothing more than a new kind of food, and set off to defeat them by chowing down. The plot largely remains stagnant aside from a few twists and developments down the road, which aren't entirely unexpected.Playing as either Chomper or Munchy, it's your job to make your way through all seven islands and reclaim the jewels before they can be put to use by the game's villain, Don Onion. Each island is comprised of three levels: the first will have varying goals depending on the island, but are generally easy to reach; the second involves taking down the Leader Pirate, a stronger-than-usual guy who commands the others; and the third consists of a boss battle, the bosses not surprisingly referred to as Boss Pirates. (This pattern breaks for the eighth and final world, which is a three-level boss rush.) During the first two levels, you platform and eat your way through the island, the more the better, to raise your score and grow bigger. Along the way, you can collect Acorns, which unlock various costumes (everything from Santa's Hat to a sink faucet), though this is not required. At the end of each level, your protagonist will meet with the Great Elder and humorously, albeit grossly, ""poop"" out orbs as a result of the level's ""meals,"" which the Great Elder takes far too much pleasure in. Boss battles range from pathetically boring to interesting and fun, and the fact that they are so inconsistent is troublesome, because you know that the development team could have done better with the less-than-great ones.Controls aren't broken but still somewhat awkward. You have the option to play with the Wii Remote and the Nunchuk, the Classic Controller, or a GameCube Controller, the foremost of which was my choice. The A button is used to eat your enemies, and the B trigger is used to attack them, which is vital to break them down if their level is higher than yours, which prevents you from swallowing them whole. The control stick is obviously used for movement, and the Z button for locking on to enemies. The awkward part comes into play when you need to jump, which is accomplished by flicking the Wii Remote; it's hard to understand without playing the game yourself, but it disrupts the flow and varies from either being too sensitive or not sensitive enough. As I said earlier, the gameplay and the controls had me swinging from liking to hating it, sometimes finding it dull and at others finding it addictive. It isn't even that the early levels were dull and the later ones were fun; they were all over the place.The game takes an interesting graphical approach, if not entirely original. Not surprisingly, the game is very colorful, and everything pops (although without coming anywhere near taking advantage of the Wii's full potential). While a good portion of the game takes place outdoors, the buildings and various other structures are literally made of cardboard. Well, I suppose since it's a video game, it's not LITERALLY cardboard, but you can see from the detail that this was a deliberate design choice. By contrast, Don Onion and his cohorts rely on more sophisticated technology, likely another design choice to show how different these two sides, good and evil, really are. At occasional spots throughout the game, the framerate stutters, which is mostly caused when you try to attack with a large amount of enemies on screen. However, the 30 frames per second is inexplicably cut in half, presumably not on purpose, for the entirety of levels 7-1 and 7-2, a major and inexcusable error. It doesn't render it unplayable, but it is extremely annoying, especially because the environment isn't that complex to begin with.The sound is, unfortunately, not really worth writing home about. The music fits the mood but isn't outstanding, save for two or three tunes; luckily, those are very catchy, but not worth trying to hunt down the MP3s. Except for three cutscenes, there is no voice acting, and the speech that accompanies the text bubbles is nothing more that unintelligible gibberish. Those three cutscenes with voice acting would have been better off without them, because not only does it sound very cheesy and fake, I could swear it was all voiced by the same guy. Trying to disguise that fact was not at all convincing.The Munchables is by no means a bad game, it's just not a very good one either. Compared to other games marketed to kids, you could do far worse, but even older gamers with something of an affinity for quirky or younger titles (such as myself) likely won't enjoy this. Even as I was writing this review, I forgot a lot of the details about the game... it doesn't stay with you. Namco Bandai did try to provide some replay value with a third character, a mirror mode, and more unlockable costumes after you beat the game, but after that initial five hours spent playing through it, you'll have no real desire to go back. One other criticism I have of the game (aside from a decidedly anticlimactic ending) is that pre-release buzz and the publisher itself mentioned that the game was also an attempt to encourage kids to eat healthier, hence the vegetable-shaped enemies. The Great Elder will even go so far as to randomly break the fourth wall with eating practices and table etiquette. But since the target audience is kids, and kids are impressionable, it would be far easier to take away from The Munchables that the moral of the story is ""to eat everything in sight."" Perhaps this is just nitpicking, but it seems like if you're going to pat yourself on the back for such a thing, you shouldn't be a hypocrite.SCORES:Presentation & Story: 7Gameplay & Controls: 6.5Graphics & Sound: 6Overall: 6",3,"Sometimes, quirkiness doesn't pay off",1275177600,"05 30, 2010"

When he got there MArio wasn't there and then a Ghost comes.  He goes into the next room he sees upstairs, and he sees a little man vacuuming up a ghost.

(For some reason it took the publisher an extra year to release it in the US.) I had been excited about the game since early 2005 when I first heard about it. I'm a big FPS and Western fan, so the prospect of this type of game with modern graphics was incredibly appealing.Well, it's not a great game, but it does certain things so right that it cheers a part of my soul. It is good to know that there are others out there as crazy as I am.In the game you play as two opposing characters, alternating between their viewpoints to fill in their respective sides of the story. Reverend Ray is a tough old codger with a violent past. He is now a preacher, and considers himself to be an instrument of God's vengeance. The other character, Billy, is a stupid kid. Ray is his uncle. Billy is framed for the murder of his parents, and Ray goes after him. That's all you really need to know, story-wise.The Good: Reverend Ray.Marc Alaimo, the actor responsible for voicing Ray, is fantastic. His performance imbues the character with all sorts of interesting nuance and power. One of the better bits of voice-acting I've ever heard, especially in a video game.The character is well-written, too, beyond just the great dialogue. Ray begins the game as a vengeful self-righteous force, but towards the end is finally made to question his ""calling."" The great part about the writing is that instead of questioning God, he questions himself. He acknowledges that it was his own selfish hatred that blinded him rather than attributing his blunder to God either misleading him or not existing. This was an unexpected turn, as stories with characters of this sort usually devolve into some sort of ""people who believe in God are crazy"" message. The character is also visually well-designed. He wears a piece of armor under his coat that actually deflects bullets in the game (complete with ricochet sounds). One of his ""weapons"" is a Bible that he quotes terrifying passages from, Pulp Fiction style. Enemies nearby will freeze when they hear it.The other good bits are the weapons. These guys did their research. While the shotguns and rifle feature no variants, the pistols are pretty great. Included are such unusual guns as the LeMat revolver, an 8-shot percussion pistol with a shotgun barrel under the main; a hold-out barrel-less SAA, which I've seen a picture of in a book before; Volcanic Repeaters, the cool looking precursors to the Winchester rifle.The Bad: Billy, the other main character.He's a wuss, a loser, and his voice acting is pretty weak. It's not horrible, but its mediocrity is highlighted by Ray's excellent performance. His playable segments are also not that fun. The bow is fun, the whip isn't, and sneaking isn't nearly as fun as running-and-gunning like Ray.The Ugly: the character animation. Whenever you're interacting with another character, all they do is stand there and talk at you. If there is ever any body acting, it's an arm movement. Otherwise, they all just stand there with their arms at their sides. Compared with the wonderful full-body acting of the characters in games like [...] it just stands out and makes the game world feel artificial. The graphics engine is actually really detailed and realistic, with dust blowing across the landscape, lots of foliage, etc, but when these barely animated puppets yell bad dialogue at you without moving, it really destroys the illusion.If you're a Western FPS fan, it's worth checking out.

2366,133580,A2YSUZ7R9AGJIU,B002FRIEAE,"R. Reining ""Old School Zinger""","[2, 3]","It seems incomprehensible that Logitech would take the time to build such a heavy and well put-together piece of equipment, ensure sound body construction, turnable guitar pegs and even a false bridge, and fail in the ways that are actually important.#1 - Fret ThisThe biggest and most glaring problem with this guitar is the fret design, feel, and functionality. This and the strum bar are like the most obvious parts of what I think should be considered when taking the time to build a guitar controller, but I guess I have to explain it when talking about this one.I understand that when building guitar controllers, it is all about trade off. Do you make the frets raised or flush, loose or sticky, how far apart do you space them? The first thing I noticed when I took the guitar out of the box was how far apart the fret buttons are spaced. However, I then realized that thinking they were spaced further apart than the normal Guitar Hero guitar controllers is just an illusion created by the extra width and length of the neck of the guitar. The problem is that even though the guitar is the largest controller I have ever used, the buttons are the same size as every other guitar controller from the Guitar Hero people. If you're going to make a larger guitar, make the buttons larger too. They don't have to be abnormally large, but it makes it very difficult to do hammer-ons and pull-offs when the frets are spaced as they are.The second problem with the frets is their shape. They are almost rectangular, which isn't a problem, but the fact that they have sharp sides is. What this means for someone like me, who plays on Expert, is that when I have fast hammer-ons of pull-offs, it's hard to slide my fingers down or up the neck of the guitar. I'm sure in time it is something I could learn to adapt to, but it seems like something that wasn't even considered. A smart guitar controller would be easy to use for people playing on beginner, but be advanced enough to meet the needs of someone playing on expert. The frets should have been more tapered at the edges, and either closer together, of just generally bigger to accommodate faster finger movement.Lastly, as far as the frets go, I have also already experienced problem with the blue button not registering when playing a chord. This is something that takes time with the guitar hero controllers to break in, but honestly, we're about four years past the release of Guitar Hero 2, it's time these people designing the controllers get with the program. From the get, Rock Band guitar controllers have never had problems with the fret buttons. They are plagued by their own set of problems, but the frets are something they do absolutely right.#2 - Strummer? -- I don't even know'er!There isn't a whole lot to complain about as far as the strum bar goes. It is stiff like I like it (that's what she said?), and there is a satisfying click when you strum (I know a lot of people prefer the silent strum bars, and I understand that, I'm not knocking this guitar for trying to please people on both sides of the aisle). This next part is going to be difficult to explain. I, and I don't know how many others do it like this, strum THROUGH the strum bar when I play. I guess picture someone playing the string of a real guitar, brushing their thumb against the string to play the note. That is how I play these guitar controllers. And while I have not yet had any trouble with over-sensitivity (strumming once and having the game read it as a double-strum when the strum bar springs back into place), when I strum through the notes, the controller makes a weird FLOINKing noise that is even more grating than the loud clicking that accompanies most of the first and second gen. Guitar Hero controllers.#3 - A Little Rough Around the EdgesI understand that this controller was designed to mimic a realistic (albeit still scale) guitar. But when you're going to sacrifice comfort for realism, my question is why? I play for maybe an hour or so a day, using this controller has hurt my right wrist, left forearm, and the bottom joints in my fingers. The neck of the guitar has pretty hard and sharp edges, and when you are moving your hand up and down the neck a lot, it is going to hurt your fingers. I ended up taking sandpaper to the edges to round them out and make it easier and more comfortable to play. This was not difficult to do, but the fact remains that it is something that should have been taken into consideration when designing it.Second, the butt of the guitar is the same way. While more rounded, there is no comfortable position to rest your strumming arm on the guitar without rubbing your forearm raw. Again I ended up putting a piece of foam held in place with double sided tape, to stop my arm from getting hurt. If you don't play on expert, you should really be fine with this guitar, and shouldn't experience very many problems, but this thing really wasn't built for the serious guitar gamer. That sounds dumb to say, but it's the truth.The spacing of the frets, and how loose they are, makes it so that you want to press down hard on them to ensure that you don't miss chords because the guitar isn't reading you as pressing the button down enough, really has hurt my wrist as well. The longer neck and the spaced frets places your wrist at an awkward angle. This is the first guitar controller that really has hurt my wrist, and that is a problem. When there are so many stupid problems plaguing something you're going to be using a lot, you eventually start to see that it just isn't worth it to keep using.In conclusion, if you don't play on expert, you will probably love this guitar. It's heavy, solid, and really cool. I mean it really is, I'm not denying it. But it really wasn't built with function at it's core. It's more showy than actually practical.",3,Faceplant,1281052800,"08 6, 2010"

Another game I'm playing these days, Uncharted Drakes fortune, completely rips off the GOW mechanics as well, but the execution is perfect. So if you're going to rip some game off, at least do it well. The shooting controls and mechanics just  feel clunky and uncomfortable. Using the sniper rifle is an exercise in futility. The screen shakes so much you're aiming all over the place and ""No diazepam for you!"" is the motto of the designer Nazis. The rest of the game just feels S L O W. I found myself constantly wondering which way to go. I  just beat Call of duty 4. The difficulty setting in that one was perfect. Want to figure out where to go by yourself? fine. It's your choice. Not a hard core explorer? No problem. They will take you by the hand the whole game. In this one is pretty much a couple of clues on the map, which is like 5 button pushes away if you need it, and pretty much you're on your on. Did I mention S L O W?If you're an RPG fan, you'll love this game. If any of what I mentioned before makes you hesitate, rent if first. This is a AAA title and there's a lot of quality here. Many people just love it. But in my opinion, some fundamental flaws ruin the execution as a whole.

Also there are too many times where an enemy is unseen offscreen, yet he sees you and kills you as soon as you get in his sight. Dying is way too easy with hidden land mines, grenades, and little ""spider"" mines that are impossible to outrun.

Third, the game's ""missions"" and other things become tedious after the 1000th time that you have done them.  Even provoking the police gets boring after a while.  Additionally, there was very little storyline or cinematics to provide an actual story.  For example, the character's ex-girlfriend all the sudden becomes a factor on the last mission.  I wish there were radio or television broadcasts that would display who or what the character affected.  Like if you murdered a mafia boss, the news would display what you did, on television or something.  Also, what's up with NPGs all the suddenly disappearing after the missions are completed?  That's a cheap tactic for the developers to limit the storyline and make it shallower than it already is.

Is it violent?  Yeah, but that sort of gimmickry really only works on the teenagers and Washington DC lobbyists.  The excessive gore gets old quicker than you'll anticipate, but thankfully you'll still be left with an above-average first-person-shooter.The developers called it GHOUL, translated it means the baddies react to wherever they get shot, sometimes hopping on one foot, sometimes covering their nether-regions, or simply revealing some blown-out intestines.  It's interesting about the first dozen times, but afterwards it's just more same-old same-old.  This GHOUL system isn't defined enough to really provide a wealth of anatomically correct reactions, only about 7 or 8.The gameplay itself is based on the now-classic Quake II engine, and while not providing the depth of Rainbow Six, or the intricate plot of Half-Life, it still manages to give the single-player gamer a compelling ride.  The story is fairly thin, almost non-existant, and the gameplay is linear to the point where any deep thought is rarely called for.

Lets be clear right off the back. and honestly i think Amazon should issue a warning under the product info that this game really is for adults only.

For adults however this can be a fun virtual world.

1062,19228,AVX1L42T98R8P,B00005ME6O,"Benjamin S. Sprague ""Broken Hierophant""","[0, 0]","I got SH 2 years ago. For its' time the graphics were great and the story was definetly something original no other game developer team had tried before. If you were to ask which I found more scary..being attacked by flesh eating mutants or receiving a genuine letter from a deceased loved one written AFTER they had died I'd be inclined to say the later.Regardless that is the Dilehma James is faced with. His dead wife has lured him back to Silent-hill and you know THAT is not going to be a happy walk in the park.First of all let me say I think this game really made people ""re-think"" the survival horror genre. It tried being witty, intelligent, and chalked with macabre symbolism as opposed to zombie arms that broke through windows. Even the side characters were more than simply devices to move the plot along. Eddie and Angela have their own interesting inner demons too and Maria looks just like James's deceased wife though her personality is drastically different. If that is not enough to sell you on this premise I could simply say ""Oh yeah this game introduces Pyramid-Head"". That alone will have people lining up in droves.Now putting everything good about the game aside I'm going to be brave and talk about why I think while it deserves ""praise"" it still is not all that and a side order of extra big fries. Yes, I know this is the game the elite Silent Snoots put on a pedestal. The one game no other SH can compare to. The Holy Grail of team silent. Is it that earth shattering?  For me anyway it was not.As with the other games there is a suspenseful build up. First it is sounds. Then it is fleeting shadows. Finally it is full blown creatures. The only problem is often there are not enough monsters and instead you are forced to aimlessly wander around trying to collect keys or pieces of an obscure puzzle. Now I admit sometimes its' fun to run around an enviorment without fear of dying to see those little details. However in a survival horror game you should never begin lulling into a calm sense of security and that's the biggest flaw of the game. In most areas I felt ""safe"" and that the monsters were easy to manuever around. Every once in awhile an eager lurching Pyramid-Head made my heart race a bit but besides for the beloved apron adorned big guy no other creatures instilled in me any amount of dread.The true disturbing factor comes from interacting with Eddie and Angela. I will not divulge why they are so psychologically unstable but talking with them alone requires a few steel nerves. These are normal people that ""snapped"" and you get the feeling you are a participant in their  horrorifying delusions. Things get stranger when you meet Maria, the sultry Dopple-ganger of Mary who embodies all Jame's sexual fantasies given flesh. Is she Jame's wife's ghost? Sadly Silent Hill never makes an explaination that easy so you have to keep playing to find out.As the game slowly drags on it picks up when we find out James has his own dark secret. When you finally get that revelation everything comes together and you know why Silent Hill's foggy streets beckoned to him.Now there is one thing I like to make clear to the fans. Pyramid Head pursued James because James subconciously wanted to be punished for his past misdeeds however  a few references from the other games prove the executioner has been apart of the town history for a long time. PH was not manifested from James, he was merely drawn to James. This is why it is OK PH was in the movie and ok he is in SH V.Examples1. In origins the gillespie house had a picture of PH. Origins took place way before Jame's arrival.2. The Room talked about ""the red devil"" and Jimmy stone. This story ties into PH if you read it carefully.3. Another document in Origins talked about ""the executioner"" as well.4. In SH 3 there is a picture of one of Alessa's past goddess incarnations with PH in the background amongst a few other people. You can view it in the cathedral.I just wanted to clear that up because there is a HUGE DEBATE raging PH should be confined to only this game which I find to be a waste of breath.As you can expect the music in this game is haunting and very befitting of Jame's sad tale and descent into madness to find his redemption. If there is one thing SH 2 gets right it is estabalishing a powerful thought provoking mood.Combat is what you expect from SH. You are not going to be able to fight like a marine. A plank with nails in it is your first weapon. That should tell you something right there. Eventually you get a few guns and a few other melee weapons besides your buddy ""Plank-zorz"".  Aside from stomping on monsters when they're down you are not a golden glove brawling champion. Perhaps it is for this reason it is good why most of the monsters are so gosh darn pathetic. Besides for the acid spewing of the patient monsters and the sheer size of the abstract daddies nothing made me feel over-whelmed that often.So in the end I'll say this game is great for atmosphere and a brilliant story. If you can stomach a horror game with more emphasis placed on wandering around, solving puzles, and talking to crazy lunatics to glean disturbing revelations you can likely over look the fact the combat engine is uninspired and the monsters are more scarce than the items in your inventory.",3,Great game if its' unique flavor is indeed your cup of tea.,1217980800,"08 6, 2008"

I finally set aside a day to completely clean and dust both screens off until they were spotless.  And then, for the first time in my life, I put screen protectors on something without a single flaw (not one bent corner, not one air bubble, and completely straight).  This is amazing and I wish all products offered a more expensive screen protector like this (See my Droid3 where the screen protector is ~20 degrees to the actual screen ahaha).I have gerbils, so my room is incredibly dusty due to their digging in the aspen constantly and tearing up cardboard.  I have to clean my screen daily, even if it stays shut.  I didn't do this for a while and have gotten a slight scratch in the top screen protector.  I wouldn't list this as a fault... because if it wasn't there, it would be in the SCREEN ITSELF.  I'm very OCD about my things, and had my DS for years without ever scratching it.  So this is a must for the first iteration of the 3DS until they get rid of the stupid raised edge around the touch screen.You'll be fine with a regular screen protector... but just know that this one can be applied almost completely perfectly by the shakiest of hands and the worst luck applying screen protectors ever.

I check to see if I can proceed but when I turn around and turn back they are there. Had this same issue on previous games. Also they are just way too good at shooting from long distances through the car when it is moving.Park a car not in exactly the right spot and it will be gone if walk away too long. I just walked around the nearest building and when I cam back it was gone.I consider myself  a slow player.  When others are done in 50 hours I can take 500 hours but this game was just over too quick even for me.  Finished in a couple of weeks after playing a few hours a night.You still can not jump from a car before it stops but you can if it is going 100 MPH?Hiding still is sketchy because the character will hide in plain site even when there is a closer more suitable location right in front of him.  If the game is going to make decisions on it's own it should at least make them correctly.Again I wish the designers would separate the online parts from the game at sale because I will not play online and I would like to not have to pay for those that do.  Also it seems every time they include online play, they take away from the campaign.  They will never learn that some of the most popular games ever (doom) (older GTA's) needed no online content or complicated controls.  I challenge them to separate the 2 types of play see who buys what.  Online could be an add on.There is a casino but you can not enter.  What at tease!On the controls page they still insist on paging through the variations automatically and again too confusingly.  I never found the control designation for throwing a grenade but I did figure out how.Music is not very good or there is not enough so it would have been better had they let us play our own from the hard drive like other games do.In their favor, you can still play the game with no new story progression. You can get and do side jobs still. You can buy properties etc. I found at least one set of Easter eggs in the form of letters. Only found 2 of fifty. This could still be played with.They could sell more new games and not have to worry about people selling used ones if the game was just so long or good that no one would want to give it up.  But they would rather attempt to prevent us from selling used games like XBox tried to do.  That way they don't have to try.  Having a hard time figuring out why it took so long to release this since their seems to be no visible groundbreaking new stuff in this game.  I would still like to see the characters use my name when speaking to me (even if it was synthesized).  Would also like to see my face on the character.  More real cities maybe.

I've been playing Final Fantasy games since 2 on the Super Nintendo (4 in Japan).  At this point, I've beaten IV-IX...Some of them up to 3 times.  Anyways, my point is don't buy this game.  If you play all the other Final Fantasies with their memorable soundtracks, developed characters, unforgettable plotlines, etc and then play this, you'll wonder what you just payed for.

This was one of those games where I would &quot;pretend&quot; that something good was going to happen..You know to make me feel like the game was worth playing.  Nope.

1225,69025,A1LHDO3D99UJSJ,B000FQ2DTA,Vic 2.0,"[0, 0]","After getting some criticism for the linearity and annoying characters in FF10, you'd think Square would never make the same mistakes again.  And especially after FF12, I had some hope for the series.  Not anymore.  Not only did they come back to linearity and annoying characters; they made these things infinitely WORSE than in 10.  Five of the six characters you get are either mildly or extremely annoying, and of course the one that ISN'T is the one you get in your party last (and it takes FOREVER to get your entire party together in one place, BTW).  This could be overlooked, however, if only the gameplay made up for it.But it doesn't come close.  The game is ridiculously linear, with the only chance to do any sort of exploring being near the very end of the game.  And even then, there are only, like, three directions you can split off into (with one of them being the way you have to go to progress the story anyway).  Get the picture?  It's like you're playing Gears of War, with the added expectation that you somehow build your characters up.Which brings me to the Crystarium system.  Wow, what a letdown.  Unlike in FF12, you get practically no freedom to develop each character as you see fit.  Each character has their own list of abilities and stats that can be gained, which means if you want one character to be a Medic (White Mage, for you FF veterans), you can do this in theory with any character but some will never be near as good as others no matter how bad you want it.  And of course, some roles aren't accessible to some players until near the end of the game anyway!  But it is always clear they want you to do it their way, not yours.  There's one character that gets a ridiculous amount of HP while most others fall dramatically behind.  You can find discussions on the internet about how this character is better than that one because he/she can learn an ability the other can't.  It's ridiculous.  Why bother giving us the ""choice"" at all, when it's obvious you think there is only a couple of ""right"" ways to do it?And the linearity doesn't stop with the (lack of) exploration or (lack of) choices when it comes to how you develop your party either.  Even in battle, there is usually a ""right"" and ""wrong"" way to win the fight.  How do you know this?  Well, once you're done fighting and you get to feeling really good about how well you kicked the enemy's ass, a screen pops up with a rating of your performance.  You see it plain as day, 1 out of 5 stars.  The game is essentially telling you you failed at doing it correctly.  And this really means you didn't win the fight FAST enough.  It's all about speed in this game.  And it's more than just a rating; it determines your chances of getting any items after battle.  And even that would be acceptable if it was consistent.  Yet some enemies are noticeably more difficult to get five stars on no matter what strategy you use.  Plus, it's not like you can go back and try most of these battles again because, as I mentioned, the game in general is unbearably linear!  70% (or more) of the locations cannot be revisited, not even near the end of the game.The battles also operate by only allowing you to assign ROLES to two of the characters while in battle; you're never allowed to directly control their actions.  You can switch their roles in the middle of battle, but you can't ever customize what they do like you could in all the others.  And you can't switch to start controlling one of these other two in battle, either.  This effectively means that if the character you're controlling dies, the battle's over.  There's no such thing as reviving the leader.Another thing that sucks about the Crystarium, that I almost forgot, is how it only lets your characters advance to a certain point and then you have to proceed with the storyline before more of it is ""unlocked"".  And it takes FOREVER for every character to be able to even BEGIN learning another set of skills (""job class"" for the veterans once more).  So even if you try to level-grind in this one by running back and forth along the narrow corridor it gives you throughout most of the game, hoping enemies you beat will respawn, there's little point.Let's see here.  Money!  Takes way too long to get the gil you need to do anything of importance.  And you need it in this game to upgrade your weapons and accessories, which you will need to read a guide online or buy the book to do efficiently because you get no hints at what each choice in upgrading your weapon is going to really do to it.  You have to use components to upgrade with, and have no idea how many of each component you'll need to get the job done until you've already used them up.This game is not all bad.  I like how if you die in battle, the game doesn't make you start from the last save point but just outside the battle so it's less frustrating that way.  I also like that you don't have to keep track of MP and the game restores your HP and all that after every battle as well.  It has a pretty good story (though it suffers from awful voice acting and narrative), a good presentation both in and out of menus, and of course amazing graphics.  It really does look gorgeous.  But it is mostly a game for show, not very fun to play at all.  Not IMO, anyway.  And it certainly does not contain half of the things that made the series great all these years.P.S. - I wasn't dissing Gears of War earlier, just pointing out that the linear gameplay doesn't work for RPGs.

The camera is used to (after only minimal, easy setup) read you or your guest's movements from 5-7 feet away.

Due to the novel control scheme, watching people dance and shuck and jive their way through the entertaining but simple minigames is the real payoff here.  The game is pretty state of the art in terms of party games - I cant imagine a better game for 6-8 people - but as fun as it is in groups it is equally slow in solo mode.

It's not terrible, but it's not great.First of all, it's pretty short. 11 missions, and not very long missions at that. The a.i. is tolerable, but the only reason the a.i. gets you is because the game throws wave after wave of them at you, not because they're actually intelligent. I breezed through the first half of the game, but then it got tedious. There's a part where you are out amongst cranes and crates trying to fight off snipers on the roofs. Problem is, you can't really see them, and there's so many of them you can't get out a shot without being torn to shreds. It's sort of like EA thought that part in Half-Life where you fight those fast ninja-like assassins was really great and they'd try knocking it off. It failed.Mostly, the last half of the game felt like that. EA being cheap to make up for poor a.i. and me just speeding through everything I could, taking plenty of damage, but squeezing out nonetheless.You get to drive an underwater version of the Aston Martin in the game too. It's cool for the first minute and a half, but then you have to navigate through an underwater mine field in a very tight tunnel and that's when the icky control problems really make themselves known and next thing you know KABOOM.But there are some fun parts. The tutorial mission is actually quite good. I had a blast on the first rail shooter level, and the first vehicle driving level. The level where you fight your way down the skyscraper is intense and fun.The multiplayer is decent, but EA's little GOOD or BAD thing is here again, as it was in The World is Not Enough for N64. This means Bond is GOOD, and so are the Bond girls, and so they cannot fight each other. Ever. The BAD players can fight each other all they want, because, you know, BAD people do that. But not GOOD. Nope. This is annoying because you get your round setup and everything, and you're like ""THIS IS GONNA BE SO COOL"" and then it tells you that you can't have GOOD players fighting each other. It's even worse than it was in TWINE, too, because TWINE at least had a lot of characters.The multiplayer levels are kinda blah, too. And there's not many of them.The bots are ok because you can alter the characterstics of the generic characters. Sadly, you can't do this for the characters you unlock which is annoying.The gamemodes they introduced probably seemed good when they were making them, but they're not very good here. Goldeneye strike, where you collect two halves of the goldeneye key and one person is automatically struck dead, sounds pretty neat, yeah? Too bad it's kinda confusing, and the deaths are very anticlimatic. King of the Hill would be good if it had a Mobile Hill option instead of just fighting it out in one spot the whole time.But still, there is at least an ounce of fun in here. If you like James Bond, you should get this, because it's cheap and you'll enjoy it every now and then. Or, better yet, if you want an EA Bond, get the first shooter they made, The World is Not Enough on N64.

People tend to put this game as one of the worse Final Fantasy games made Is it really the worse Final Fantasy game though? No. And I'll try to explain it here as best as I can (since I still can't understand the controversy with this game. Then again, I'll never understand this fanbase like how I don't want to understand the Sonic fanbase).Story: Taking place after Final Fantasy X, Yuna is now the main character. She's no longer the Summoner though. Free from her role, she decides to be a sphere hunter with her cousin Rikku. They are joined by Paine and they form a group with other people called the Gullwings. Yuna's mission though is to find Tidus after the end of Final Fantasy X. This is pretty much the main plot but adding the fact that Yuna has to save the world again as there are other problems going on with the people and another conspiracy that is planning to happen. I think the story is inferior to the original X story HOWEVER, this is a great way to pick up after X. Without Sin, people don't live in fear and without fear, people can live on happily and fight over something else.Characters: People's major complaint was how Yuna's personality went 180. Let me tell you know that a few years can change people and at the end of X, Yuna was breaking out of her shell. Why continue living the life of a summoner when she can be someone else and live life to the fullest? The other characters also have to move on with their lives. Rikku is more chirpy now that the discrimination against her race isn't as bad as it was in X. Kimhari has to rebuild the Ronso Tribe again. Wakka and Lulu are married and have to prepare for a family again. So everyone is being developed. This game also introduces new characters of course like Paine so it wasn't just the old cast. So the change in her character is good because they cannot be the same after the incident with Sin.Gameplay: The gameplay is the highlight for me of this game. The battle system isn't turn base now. What you do instead is like in the previous FF games where events go on when you're inputting commands (but you're still going to be standing there) so battles are very fast. What's great is that with the dress sphere system, you can change the way you attack. Don't want Yuna to be the gunner by default? Switch to dancer or vice versa. I think the dress spheres is a beautiful aspect of the game and gives you many ways to play and you'll be choosing which one suits each girl. Now alas some outfits do come off as being fanservice based but I personally thought that Yuna looked pretty as a songstress/lady luck and didn't think of the skin exposure as a little kid. I think the downside is equipping weapons though. Because you focus mainly on dressphere, equipping items are practically worthless given how each dressphere gives you a standard move anyway. Another downside is how Yuna got rid of her summons to be mighty powerful but this is for plot related reasons.Music: Still think the music is one of the best (but it's Final Fantasy). Music is actually a big part of the plot which is why the music has to be top notch. 1000 Words is a powerful song regardless if you don't like the game or not. Very meaningful and deep. Not the crap we get nowadays that is dubbed music.So overall, I give this game a 4/5. In honesty, the only Final Fantasy game I can give a 5 star rating is IX (I'll review that in the future), but this is a good game in its merit and it didn't drop in quality at all. Since the game is cheap now, I would suggest to buy it after you beat X so you won't get confused with the story like I did (I got this game first before X...)",4,Still a Fun Final Fantasy Game,1362009600,"02 28, 2013"

But boy you'd have to go out of your way to ignore the sidequests and ""social"" elements of the gameplay.Just as with Fable 1, there are no hard consequences for anything you do.  So you can be totally evil and then do some good deeds and now you are ""good"" again as if you had never been evil.  Ideally, the game would have at least a few more permanent consequences or permanent rewards for being good and evil.I downloaded the game to the 360's hardrive as one can do now with the recent update to the console and that made a difference in loading times.So, its not a game for everyone.

But straight out of the box she was pretty powerful and a lot of fun to play with among the newest figures available. Initially her earth element attack consists of shooting a crystal out of her curled up tail (like a scorpion). It makes her appear a little more aggressive while she's in battle(for the guys out there). She spins as part of her secondary attack (like Warnado) but seems to be much more powerful and controllable. I have found her to be surprisingly useful when battling the human shields. They can't be attacked from the front, but you can spin ""dash"" behind them and attack. As her third attack she shoots multiple lasers all around her from her wings(they can't be aimed). This doesn't help with enemies straight in front of her, but it does shoot all the way around her sides and from behind which is handy when she becomes surrounded. Over time she increases in damage levels from her crystals, and gets her armor increased by 40 after the third upgrade. She never truly flys, just spins quickly. Her final Soul Gem upgrade can be found in the ""Bringing Order to Kaos"" level. This creates a crystal lighthouse that keeps Flashwing from moving but creates a long range attack from a light emitted from it every few seconds and is her most powerful damaging attack.BEGINNING STATS:MAX HEALTH:260SPEED:43ARMOR:24CRITICAL HIT:10ELEMENTAL POWER:25Choose Your Path Choices:SUPER SHARDS PATH:This attack strengthens her long-range abilities with more rapid fire of her crystal shards. After her fourth upgrade on this path her crystal shards stick into surrounding walls and shoot an additional attack when you press her primary attack button (the X on PS3) a second time. Her last upgrade along this path actually helps her to heal from those wall embedded crystals as she passes closely. Each crystal gives her an increase of 5 HP.SUPER SPINNER PATH:This increases her ability to do more of a spin ""dash"" attack with increased damage and armor while spinning. Eventually with her ""Reflection Deflection"" upgrade her armor increases to over 100 while spinning! This upgrade also reflects her opponent's shots right back at them.KEEP IN MIND WHEN YOU CHOOSE YOUR PATH.. ONLY THE SERIES 2 (OR ORIGINAL RE-RELEASED)FIGURES CAN CHANGE BETWEEN PATHS AT ANY TIME. I GUESS IT'S A BONUS FOR BUYING THE ""NEW"" OLD FIGURES.MY OPINION:In the early stages of the game with all the currently available figures, I'd have to say that Flashwing and Hot Head are my top two new characters that I like! They are my 6 year old son's favorite too! I tend to prefer ones with powerful attacks, not melee attacks, by the way. I was honestly shocked by her beginning critical hit number (being her weakness) but I have really enjoyed playing her and can only guess that she must get powered up rather quickly from her starting numbers or the Pants Hat that looks like red and white spotted boxers made the difference.AMAZON AND OTHER RETAILERS SELL FOR APPROXIMATELY $9.99ANY OTHER AMOUNT IS THIRD PARTY..",5,"A NICE, EARLY, POWERFUL, SURPRISE!!",1351555200,"10 30, 2012"

I ordered 3 of them and they all had the same issues. The pages were all warped and curved so that the cartridges in the center weren't flush with the page, the games were held far too snugly and were extremely difficult to remove, the latch on the case is very poor and popped open constantly by itself, and there are 2 slots per case for memory cards, which I have absolutely no use for and I can't imagine most people do either. It's just wasted space. This may be nitpicking, but I was willing to overlook the two empty memory card slots that I couldn't put my games in, but I was extremely irritated to find the orientation of the games was different on the inside and outside pages. The 3DS games cannot go in the same direction on all pages, meaning some are upright and some are upside down. I wanted this case for easy browsing of my games, and when half of my games are upside down, it kind of defeats the purpose.

I took it home on the weekend and spent a few hours on it, and yes my expectations weren't disappointed.I think everyone by now has got a pretty good idea of what Gears 2 is about - better graphics, more weapons, more Locusts, more collectables, more violence. Although I should reemphasis that the single-player campaign is longer, and as I'm not usually into multiplayer, I find this aspect particularly attractive. However, now that they have added a horde mode, I'll definitely try out multiplayer in due time.I don't want to echo the words of other reviewers so perhaps I'll focus on something else - the packaging and extra stuff of the Limited Edition. I knew right away I was getting the Limited Edition, it comes with a different (better) cover obviously, and the whole package is contained in a metal box that features the Lancer assault rifle. The art and surface finishing on the box are tip top. Opening the box shows two DVDs (game & extra commentaries/footages), one overlaying on the other. On the left are the manual, code for extra maps and an advert. leaflet for Fable 2. There is a transparent inner plastic layer covering the inside of the metal box; the inside of the box shows the original mural illustration of the Gears 2 cover. The whole package just looks and feels fantastic. I love holding it, my wife thinks I'm a bit looney.The meat of this Limited Edition is the hard-cover ""Beneath the Surface: An Inside Look at Gears of War 2"", featuring wonderful art work and brief history of the Gears Universe; the book immerses you into the universe and makes you appreciate the game even further. There's also a small pic of Dom and his wife Maria, which I'm using as a bookmark for Beneath the Surface.As I pre-bought this Limited Edition, the price I paid is the price the normal version is selling now after the release date, so it was definitely worth it.

6170,183511,A3OI05RGQQN33R,B0050SXGU8,Rock Hard,"[5, 12]","Where do I begin?  No, I'm not going to burst forth into a song of melodic melody.  I'll start with the first Crysis game.  Nomad was the main character of the game and he didn't die.  So what happened?  Why didn't he continue onto Crysis 2?Why?  Because the writers are a mass of unimaginative gunk....that's why.  There's no logic whatsoever in putting a character into play that wasn't the main character to begin with.  It's like starting a story with Superman and then in the next issue having Supergirl take over and not even mention Superman.  Or like dumping Drake from Uncharted: Drake's Fortune and having Sully or one of the girls continue the following stories.  That's how dislocated the Crysis series is.  The creators of Crysis are weak when it comes to continuing something--anything in a logical sequence.  It's beyond them.  They have no talent for it and should do us a favor a get out of storytelling.Nomad should have been the character brought back to Crysis 2.  But the fools brought back the Prophet character.No matter, even though it defies logic, he didn't take up much of the story especially since he blew his brains out.  As to Prophet continuing the jagged storyline instead of Nomad, I can safely say it was a great mistake.  And why does Prophet need the Marines to help him find Dr. Gould?  What kind of wimpy super soldier is this bogus creation?  There are not enough fingers to plug-up these bursting dams.Alcatraz (Crysis 2) is the new protagonist and the story is pretty good and has some sense to it, that is, until you come to the ending and a man that committed suicide once again takes over the body of Alcatraz or so I thought until Crysis 3.  The mere fact that Prophet regains his complete mind, body and soul is impossible.  Crytek believes that you and I are so low in our mindset that it didn't even cross their minds that they were feeding the gaming world left over fragments of bad brainstorming.  And if they did, it clearly reflects their lack of respect for the gaming public's ability to perceive a game full of worms.  For me, Prophet is dead.These writers are undeniably moronic or smoke a great deal of bad seaweed.  In Crysis 3 Prophet some how not only takes over the mind of Alcatraz's body but gets his body back!  What lowlife thought up this idea...this urine based tale for consumption?  I could not and would not accept this ridiculous impossibility and illogical story.  Alcatraz, to any normal non-seaweed smoking individual, should have continued to lead the way in Crysis 3.  Prophet is dead.Simply put, it's a stupid and unbelievable story.Nevertheless, if you ignore Cryteks ignorance in story writing, you can still have fun shooting;  but, fun factor in this game is not even close to Crysis 2....not only in story but in the soundtrack as well.  One thing that Crysis 2 had was an amazing soundtrack which was even better than the story itself.  Crysis 3--forget it--nothing--a flat and uninspiring soundtrack.  In fact I can't even remember a single sound byte from this terrible follow-up tale of miserable woe--woe in maniacal writing.In the end what has Crytek given us?  They've given us a trilogy of nonsensical and illogical stories that truly cannot be tied together in any believable or enjoyable way.Also, I expected the bow in Crysis 3 to be something stupendous and it wasn't.  ""Bowhunter Edition,"" is a misnomer.  I forgot about this weapon during game play and only remembered it occasionally and usually, only, after I ran out of ammo for my other weapons--and sometimes I just resorted to the melee function to overcome opponents.  Overall it's one of the weakest weapons in the provided arsenal.  The new upgrade system to the nanosuit is confusing and not easily understood and for most of the game it didn't really seem to make that much of a difference especially when cloaking.  In Crysis 2 when I unlocked all the upgrades for the cloaking ability, I could really tell the difference and it was amazingly useful.  The story is poor in itself and attempts to rationalize the bunk about the Cell taking over when they had been decidedly defeated in Crysis 2 by the military...as I said, nothing adds up after Crysis--the writers/Crytek lost their logic compass and became raving haywires on a mission to create nothing but tangents into every conceivable direction.In summation, if you wish to play a really good game that suddenly becomes stupid at the very end, then play Crysis 2.  If you wish to play a mediocre game that is stupid in every respect, then you must assuredly play Crysis 3.  The first one is good too especially when Nomad goes into the depths of the mountain...the nanosuit is not as good with cloaking but  the game is still a thousand times better than Crysis 3.  Are the graphics as good?  In some ways yes and in others no; nevertheless, it's a much better game.Crytek, you screwed up royally.  There's no way to dig yourself out of this miasma, unless you redo Crysis 2 and Crysis 3 and that's not on the drawing table...what a bunch of boneheads!",1,Illogical...in every way.,1363392000,"03 16, 2013"

4318,149728,A2N60VDBR10N18,B00320JDWG,Tyler Johnson,"[1, 2]","Spec ops the line is a difficult game to review. At first glance, it looks like your standard military shooter, but scratch the surface, and you'll see just how layered it truly is. For one, calling this game ""fun"" is a little misleading. COD and BF are ""fun"". Appropriate phrases to describe Spec ops the line are: haunting, thought provoking, cinematic, stark, jarring, traumatic, eye opening, genre defying, or even artistic achievement. Now, while many of those don't sound like fun, make no mistake, this game is still very enjoyable.You start the game as Captain Martin Walker, accompanied by the rest of your delta squad, Lieutenant Adams and Sergeant Lugo. The game starts with a bang, and establishes exactly what makes this game great. The visuals are breathtaking, showing the faded beauty of Dubai as it is slowly swallowed by ever worsening sand storms. The combat is fast and effective, and the characters are rich and engaging. The main gist of the story consists of Walker and his men going into storm savaged Dubai to investigate a distress call from a colonel Konrad. What starts as a reconnaissance mission, quickly becomes something darker, and far more engaging.Spec ops is based off of the story ""Hearts in Darkness"", the book that inspired ""Apocalypse Now (Apocalypse Now / Apocalypse Now Redux / Hearts of Darkness) (Three-Disc Full Disclosure Edition)  [Blu-ray]"". The biggest surprise about Spec ops is the fact that it's biggest strength is its dark and engaging story, that I won't ruin for you. Needless to say, things are most definitely not as they appear.A quick aside to any parents, Spec ops is not Call of Duty. It is not Battlefield. It is not the game equivalent of a glossy Hollywood blockbuster, though it does have some truly impressive set pieces. Spec ops bucks the trend set by these games by NOT glorifying armed combat. There is blood, cursing, violence, but more than that, the horrors of war are on full display, and I leave it up to you to decide whether or not these scenes are appropriate for your kids. There are no ""good guys"" in the same way there are no ""villains"". The decisions you make are never black and white, but are motivated by the need to survive. Walker and his team are deep in enemy territory with no intel, and nothing is as it seems. This desperate fight for survival and lack of perspective is perfectly encapsulated by a certain segment in the game that has caused some controversy. I won't ruin it, except to say ""willy pete"" is not just a funny name.The combat is straight forward and easy to pick up, and while I had no problem going through this game on the second hardest mode from jump, I have heard from many other people that, even on the lower difficulties, this is not an easy game. Thankfully you have your team to back you up, and I'm happy to say that, for the most part, Adams and Lugo are two of the best friendly AI partners I've ever played with. You can give them targets on the field; Lugo can snipe for long range, and Adams has grenades for entrenched enemies. If the opposition doesn't know you are there, equip a silencer and take them out, or better yet, get your team to do it. They will very ably sneak up and stealthily dispatch your foes for you, without raising the alarm. When things get a hectic, and you find yourself pinned down, have them throw a flash grenade to buy yourself some breathing room, or have them attack the person pinning you down, so that they draw their fire, freeing you up to take care of them yourself. There is an environmental component to the game, where you destroy barriers, dropping sand on them to end the fight, and while it is certainly fun, it is rarely used.The one gripe I do have with the combat is that the cover system isn't as flexible as the situation usually calls for. On the higher difficulties, your opposition is not shy about using grenades, and if you are in cover, healing one of your team, or in the process of throwing your own grenade, it is much harder to get to safety than it should be. Even if you are able to avoid the grenade's kill radius, be prepared to be shredded by enemy fire before you can get back into cover. To be fair, this problem can usually be avoided by playing smart, and using your team effectively, but in a certain part late in the game, your team isn't accessible, and you are vastly outnumbered. Having cruised through the game up to that point, it is jarring to hit a wall of difficulty like that, and does take away from the overall experience.Beside that small issue, Spec ops: The Line is an excellent game that redefines what military shooters can achieve. The action is fast, fun, and for the most part effective, the story is intelligently written and suitably dark, the characters are organic and engaging, and the overall experience is very fulfilling. It is definitely not the feel good game of the year, but it offers a uniquely gratifying experience that, in my book, makes it a solid contender for game of the year.

6850,11553,A3GRU9732S4V1U,B00004TCT3,"Robert Jenkins ""video geek #1""","[17, 17]","Let me just state at the outset here that I am a 32-year old engineer who has been playing and loving electronic video games since he stuck a quarter into a Galaxian machine in 1981.  I first kinda got interested in Pokemon after my young kids fell in love with the TV series.  After watching umpteen episodes with them, I got interested in the different types of Pokemon and how they compared to each other.  I decided to give the Silver version a shot, having never played any of the previous Red, Blue, or Yellow versions.I was hooked immediately!  The plot is easy to follow without getting boring, and there are plenty of little side quests to make things interesting.  You can start out with your choice of Totodile (my pick), Cyndaquil, or Chikorita.  The level of difficulty of the game will be determined by your starting choice.  The game has two basic goals: (1) Acquire all gym badges and defeat the Pokemon League while fighting off your rival and Team Rocket, and (2) collect all 251 Pokemon.  Most of the pokemon are fairly easy to find and catch, some are pretty hard, and there are a few that are almost impossible to catch.  But, they can all be caught with a little time and patience.  Some are only available by trading with other versions of the game, and some are &quot;baby&quot; pokemon that can only be obtained by breeding two adult pokemon together.  And, of course, there are the two &quot;super-rare&quot; Pokemon Mew and Celebi, which can realistically only be obtained through a Game Shark or other similar device.That leads me to my one and only gripe about the game.  If it were possible to obtain all 251 Pokemon, no matter how difficult, without having to resort to things like the Game Shark, I would have happily given this review 5 stars.  I also have kind of a problem with the fact that you have to have access to more than one version of the game to get all the Pokemon.  I know Nintendo talks about how much fun trading is and all, but to me, it just seems like a gimmick to sell more copies of the game.  I know several kids who have purchased both Silver and Gold versions becuase of this.  Not everyone has easy access to trading partners.Since I bought Silver, I have also played through a copy of Pokemon Red.  If you have only played Red, Blue, or Yellow, let me assure you that Silver (and Gold) is a major improvement.  The new versions eliminate many of the more irritating deficiencies of the old version with an improved backpack for item storage and a new device that lets you tell instantly where you are without having to carry a Town Map in the backpack.  Backpack space will definitely be at a premium, so anything that clears up space is a positive feature.After having played through Silver and collected all 251 Pokemon (yes, I actually purchased a Game Shark), I have not played it again.  Why?  Because after all the time and trouble I went through to collect all the Pokemon, I just can't bring myself to erase them all.  (A great improvement for the next Pokemon would be to allow multiple saves on the cartridge.)  For those who are interested, my &quot;dream team&quot; that I used to beat the game were:  Feraligatr, Pidgeot, Magneton, Kadabra, Magmar, and Dragonite.Overall, this is an AWESOME game.  If you enjoy RPG games such as Final Fantasy, then you will enjoy this and the other titles in the Pokemon series.  Enjoy!",4,"Fun for adults, too....",1004486400,"10 31, 2001"

Anyway, your trying to escape from this new island when you get assaulted by people who have the same kind of powers as you, and the big cheese known as Sereum (or something like that) tries killing you and that dame from early... so naturally you want vengenace.... especialyl after he kills your man Doyle from Instincts.Though different stories, both games play exactly a like. Through Jack's eyes you get a lot of weapons from assault rifles, shotguns, .50 caliber machine guns you can rip out of the ground, sniper rifles, and others to destroy numerous enemies - though you can only carry 3 types of weapons, most of the smaller ones can be duel wield. You can also use your animal moves which can be entertaining like when you punch a pirate 100 miles away. There are a lot of vehicles to drive such as hummers, ATVs, hand gliders (that was cool), various types of boats, trucks, and many more.. though there are no tanks. In both games you can set traps, which include laying claymore mines into the ground or tying up branches so when enemies walk near them the branch whips back scoring you an instant kill. It was pretty cool, but got pretty useless later on.There is a multiplayer and it is pretty fun. There are many types of game modes ranging from mere deathmatches & capture the flag games to ""Predator"" games where one person becomes feral and stalks other players. There is also a map editor where you can make your own stages with any kind of box, vehicle, emplacement, or anything which is a really cool feature. Great for X-Box Live.Lets talk difficulty. Far Cry Predator is a pretty hard game for a few reasons: You'll be fighting ALOT of enemies at one time (both in air and on ground), the weapons seem sort of weak when you're using them, and your health depletes WAYYY too fast - for instance you'll get shot like twice with an assault rifle and you're almost dead. However, the boss fights are pretty simplistic and just require you to slash at them with your claws for a few moments.. so its a win-lose situation: It's hard to get up to the boss, but the boss is easy.Graphics are kinda subpar figuring they just used the normal X-Box mechanics, but they still look pretty good. The white beaches, dense jungles, dark caves, and crystal clear water look beautiful... the character models look a little lame and boxy, but one quick glance at the enviroments and you can easily forget about them.Almost all of the sounds were great. The music was really thumbs up and helped add a bit of lonliness & freakyness to the atmosphere. The guns sounded great, and the voice acting was awesome - Jack Carver is the man. He curses, is sarcastic, tough... he has a lot of personality that is shown through his dialouge.Now for endings. Instincts was boring - you beat Crowe, Kreiger gets killed by some mutants, Doyle & Cortez pick you up in a helicopter. You say, ""Cortez - you owe me a damned boat!"" and Doyle gives you a suitcase full of money. You grin and fly away.. thats it. In Evolution, after you beat the leader of the new Feral people (Sereum), you meet the dame who hired you and tried to kill you near the end of the game, and she starts freaking out because..well...she tried to kill you and you survived. You throw her money at her and she says,"" There was nothing else I could do Jack."" and your character looks at her and goes, ""There was a time when I used to think like that too."" and kicks open a door to reveal a way off the island. Thats it.... sadly, Doyle dies. Sort of lackluster, but every game's ending has been bad so far.To finish it up Far Cry is a pretty run of the mill FPS with only a FEW qualities that make it stand out slightly. Sure its intense, and sure the multiplayer is good but the game is kinda short, the ending doesn't feel rewarding, and when your done with the stoy (and don't have X-Box Live) then there really isn't much reason to play Predator again.

2159,144426,A1FVN80HHHR3RA,B002LARYGA,P. Killion,"[2, 2]","While this may have been considered somewhat of a niche remote, I think when you take into account how many PS3s have been sold, it really shouldn't be. So, it's surprising to take into account the lack of options one has for controlling the PS3 as a Blu-Ray/DVD player. Now right off the bat, there's always the Sony PS3 remote; it's not badly priced, and may fit the bill for some. But for many, it's just yet another remote to have. Universal remotes won't work with the PS3; they require a Bluetooth capability to control the PS3, which means you can either get an adapter for nicer universal remotes (costly), or get an infrared device for the PS3 (lacks options).The Blu-Link Universal Remote fills that niche however, meaning it can control your PS3 just like the Sony version, yet is also an infrared universal remote that control all (up to 5) other devices. Typically, when a product is the sole product in a niche environment, it suffers from either poor quality, or high cost. Fortunately, the Blu-Link remote is neither, as it functions as it should, and while not the cheapest universal remote, is far from being on the high-range or really mid-range in cost.Overall, the functions of the remote are very nice. Programming was a snap for me, first was setting up the PS3, which works just like setting up the Sony remote (on the PS3, go to accessory settings).Next, I programmed the TV, an LG plasma, which required a 4 digit code to be input (merely hold down the device button you wish to control to enter setup mode); the first code didn't control all functions, but the second one did perfectly. I setup my cable box, which had most major service providers listed; I chose Comcast (my provider), and it works perfectly.Finally, I wanted to setup my HTPC, which surprisingly this remote has codes for as well, so a typical Windows Remote should be a snap to setup. Mine is controlled via Logitech Z-Cinema, so I had to use the remote's learning function. Learning is probably the greatest thing to happen to universal remotes since the invention of universal remotes, and the Blu-Link's learning mode is easy to use. Essentially, just hold down the device you wish to control to enter setup, hit the record button, hit the button you want to program on the remote (such as volume up), then hit volume up on the device's remote you're learning from while aiming the two remotes at each other, and that's it. You can then select another button to learn, or you can switch to a different device to exit learning mode (note: you can only learn 50 functions total I'm told from another review). Simple.I had all my devices FULLY programmed in under 5 minutes. That's impressive, even my nice URC remote took a lot longer to program and was slightly more annoying to setup.There are some downsides to this remote. First, I have to say, the buttons are tiny, and I mean that. Like smaller than cellphone buttons tiny. The remote itself is pretty darn small; I have small hands, but wouldn't have minded an extra half inch on the remote for bigger buttons. The buttons are also small dots, where they could have easily used wide buttons; my URC remote that this is replacing (the touch screen cracked, eek!) had a much better feel on the buttons. Second, light-up buttons are a nice feature they should have added, something my cheap Panasonic universal I purchased from Wally-world for under 20 even has.All in all, this was an excellent remote, from a company I've never heard of, and they made an excellent product. I hope they come out with a version 2 (which I imagine they might since the remotes are going down in price quickly), it'd be nice to see them update this device. I should also note, the controls work flawless. Everything is snappy, no delayed or missed presses, something you'd think should be the number-one priority in a remote, but you'd be surprised, this is one of the snappiest remotes I've ever used to be honest. I'd definitely recommend it, but big paws will probably want to steer clear.",4,"Nice little remote, emphasis on the little...",1294099200,"01 4, 2011"

It was one of the first (if not the first) game to use light and shadow as part of the gameplay, not just for visual effect. I was impressed with the enemy AI, the robust gameplay, the responsive controls, interactive environments, and impressive real-time shadows. At the time it was released, it was all very cutting edge. The sequel, Pandora Tomorrow, was a decent game, but did nothing to progress the series forward. Then came Chaos Theory, the (still) best game in the series, and one of the greatest games of last gen. Chaos Theory improved in every area, from the AI and graphics to the story and level design, and was a significant leap forward for the series.Double Agent, the next game in the series, and the first SC game developed for next-gen, had some high standards to live up to. Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations, and although it wasn't a bad game, it did nothing to move the series forward and did not feel like a next-gen game. Conviction, the 5th game in the series, was a drastic change for the series, but that change was not for the better. All of the stealth elements that I enjoyed were tossed out the window for a manic run-n-gun approach. As SC games go, this was the worst in the series. And that brings us to Blacklist.Blacklist has been described as a cross between Chaos Theory and Conviction. The truth is it's a cross between Double Agent and Conviction. That is to say, it combines some of the action elements of Conviction, like automatic Execution kills, and cover-to-cover run, and the stealth elements the series is known for. Unlike Conviction, however, you don't have to use or rely on these gameplay mechanics. If you prefer to go in quiet and use stealth, you can take out enemies one by one, quietly, lethal or non-lethal. Or, if you're really good, you can sneak by enemies unnoticed, and never even touch them. Of course, you have to option to go in guns blazing, but you probably won't last long. I appreciated the freedom of choices I was given, and only during a few moments did I feel like the game forced me play a certain way.The gameplay has almost everything you'd expect from a SC game, from climbing upside-down on pipes to peering under doors with fiber-optics, you really feel like a super spy. Unfortunately, the level design wasn't very impressive. Each level felt like the same thing over and over. Yes, there are multiple paths and approaches for each mission, but from level to level I never really felt challenged to change my thinking. I found the most effective approach for me was to hide in a doorway, make a noise to lure in the nearest enemy, then subdue him when he got close. This worked 99% of time, and the enemies wouldn't really care much that their friends were disappearing one by one. Even if an enemy comes across one of the bodies you left behind, they'll search around a 10 foot radius and if they don't find you in 60 seconds, they'll assume everything is fine and go back to not caring. Granted, I was playing on Normal difficulty, but I played previous SC games on normal as well, and I don't remember enemies being so careless. The AI felt like a step back from Chaos Theory.The controls feel a bit stiff and unresponsive when compared to most modern games, and although it's been years since I played Chaos Theory, I remember the controls in that game being more intuitive and responsive than Blacklist. In previous SC games, how far you push the control stick had a direct effect on Sam Fisher's movement speed. Push the stick 35% of the way, Sam moves at 35% speed. Push it 89% of the way, Sam moves 89% speed. Not in Blacklist. Sam has two speeds: slow and fast. Push the stick anywhere between 1% and 50%, Sam moves 50% speed. Push the stick anywhere between 51% and 100%, Sam moves 100% speed. WHAT THE HECK!? Analog sticks have been around since the N64 days, I'd think we'd move past this two speed crap. The fact that previous SC games had 1:1 movement responsiveness makes Blacklist's controls unacceptable. Besides that there were moments where buttons would not respond, and moments where shooting over obstacles would not respond until I released the Aim button, which caused me to inexplicably miss shots and give away my position. None of this made the game unplayable. The game is playable. It just felt dated and awkward for a big budget game from a major publisher in the year 2013. I expect better.The graphics in Blacklist are also disappointing. They're not terrible, but they're not as good as you could reasonably expect from a big budget game in 2013. Characters look plastic and shiny, shadows often look badly pixelated, and frame rate hiccups and screen tearing are frequent. Textures are a bit blurry and some of the poly-counts looks a little low. The animations during cut scenes are really, really good, but during gameplay they look stiff.Sound design is the best aspect of Blacklist. The music is great, and fits with the tone and mood of the game. It reacts to your situation and heightens the tension, whether you're sneaking up on a group of terrorists or running for your life from a firefight, the music enhances each moment of your adventure and never sounds mismatched or out of place. The sound effects are also well done, and many of the classic sounds like the start-up buzz of your night vision goggles return from previous games. The voice acting is great as well, and each actor plays their character with complete believability. When the excellent voice acting combines with the excellent animations in the cut scenes, it really brings the characters to life and made them compelling to watch. The sound balance is perfect, too. I frequently notice weird audio balance in games and I have to go into the audio options to balance the music, sound effects and voice levels. Blacklist does not have separate levels for the audio, but does have settings for Headphones, Stereo, and 5.1 Surround. All three are perfectly balanced for whatever your home audio setup.Blacklist's story is pretty good. It's basically an excuse to travel around the world fighting bad guys, but the plot makes just enough sense to not make it feel arbitrary. What really works in Blacklist is the dialog. The interaction between the characters is strong, and the technical jargon is plausible yet not confusing. Each character has a strong personality and a good reason for being in the story. Even the villains felt like human beings with motives instead of just being evil for the sake of being evil like so many videogame badguys tend to be.The multiplayer component of Blacklist is strong, with the co-op being a highlight. They don't always utilize cooperation like the co-op missions in Chaos Theory did. You can pretty much play like two lone wolves and still get through the missions, but playing cooperatively will make some parts easier. Unfortunately, the graphics, animation, controls, and frame rate all have the same problems in multiplayer that are present in single player. The whole time I was playing I couldn't help feeling like it should and could have been better.It's a shame that the good parts of Blacklist don't outweigh the mediocre parts. The gameplay, graphics, animation, and controls all fail to impress, and feel like a step backward. The sound and writing are great but can't save what is ultimately a forgettable game.",3,Forgettable,1377734400,"08 29, 2013"

Although it is rated Teen, it uses some ""choice"" language at times, and there's a couple of jokes or lines of dialogue that run a more sexually-inclined course.That being said, Enslaved is at it's core a very fun game. The platforming harkins back to the Prince of Persia games with the added tweak of grabbable spots being highlighted, something that is helpful to gamers who may be new to the genre. The combat might seem a bit like a button masher at times, but there are enough enemies who need a different approach that it doesn't get too repetitive. And the story; the meat of the game, is interesting albeit not as influenced by Journey to the West as the developers want you to believe (though this isn't a bad thing, it just makes one wonder why the emphasis on the supposed similarities).That being said, there are a few things holding it back only slightly, and not enough to warrant anything less than 5 stars. The camera is rather fussy at times, particularly when platforming. This can get agitating when a player wishes to see an area from behind them for example, only to have have the camera fight to stay fixed, and swing back to their side. This becomes more of a minor annoyance than an actual problem though. A few times the controls can be a bit screwy as well, although not very often and never in a gamebreaking way. A somewhat disappointing (in my opinion) ending ruins what was otherwise an interesting story. Arguably the only good from the ending is it could be said that it leaves a potential for a sequel, but one can hope they won't as the game is fine by itself.I bought this game during the sale when it was 35 dollars and think it was well worth the price. I'd even go so far as to say I think it's worth the regular price of 60 dollars.

Daneker,"[1, 1]","Uncharted 3 easily takes the best of story-telling, animation and graphics that set the first two apart while correcting most of the little issues at the same time. The graphics are more varied and the color pallet is deep and rich, the sound is spot on and the voice acting pitch perfect. Now that Drake's a full-fledged franchise game and a flagship title for Playstation the story is deeper and better fleshed out without being just an explanation for the action. The bad guys are more than shallow evil menaces and the overall scope is on par with any big-money action film.There are some negatives here though. Nathans movement feels stiff, he didn't seem to turn well and when he walks he looks like his back is bothering him. At the same time, Sully, who needed Nathan to open an easy walking path for him in the first two games is suddenly much spry and though you don't see him, he must be performing much of the same acrobatics as Drake to keep up. Also Sully moves from side-kick to father figure, we see sully pull young Nathan off the streets and mentor him in flashbacks, and in present time we see him more assertive and certain than in the previous games.The one other issue is the sudden onslaught of enemies. There are a few points in the game that have Drake dying over and over and over as he is swarmed from all sides, something I expect at every moment in Halo but here it seems a bit much. The mercenaries have a large, unending army of clones that seem to attack perpetually at times and shooting them can feel like a game of wak-a-mole. Less enemies, more strategy would serve the game better.The last issue is exploration. There's more vast, excellent locations to explore, except mostly you run through them. I only got about 30% of the artifacts on my first run because the game just isn't geared towards exploration. More options for explorations and more tangible rewards could have added hours to the game play. Given the style of game, trying to work it like a FPS just isn't the best approach.Like the first two, this is a fun game, looks good, sounds good and is highly addicting, but the payoff comes too fast and the treasure hunter aspect is once again left behind for long, drawn out firefights with the clone-army.

A Link Between Worlds is a direct sequel to the 1992 Super Nintendo game A Link to the Past, and if you&#8217;ve played that game, you&#8217;ll immediately recognize the world this game takes place in. The land of Hyrule is nearly identical between the two games. The game doesn&#8217;t assume you are familiar, but rewards you if you are.Zelda games traditionally are all about puzzle solving, and I&#8217;ve found the puzzles in this game to be some of the most challenging I&#8217;ve played, but not so challenging as to become frustrating. The level design is clever, and often takes advantage of the 3DS&#8217;s stereoscopic 3D feature.Where this game differs from most Zelda games is that, instead of having to work through dungeons in order to collect the right tools you need to complete the puzzles, you have access to nearly the full arsenal from the very start, and can move through the stages in whatever order you discover them in. Additionally, instead of having to walk back and forth across the large world in this game, you can choose to instantly travel to any save point you&#8217;ve previously visited.These new features make many tasks common in Zelda games far less monotonous.The perfection of the gameplay could be criticized by some as Nintendo simply walking a victory lap and not really taking any risks with the formula - this is the 17th Zelda game, after all. But rather than a rehash of old ideas, I consider it a distillation.

Eventually I came across Persona 4 and noticed it was getting rave reviews and was said to have improved on aspects of Persona 3. Awesome! I thought. I was wrong.My biggest qualm with P4 is it's unbelievably restrictive time-line based gameplay. I've always loved RPG's for their sense of freedom, exploration and the fact that you are encouraged to play how you want, hence ""Role-play"". I even enjoy time based games as well, Dark Cloud had aspects of this, but to a less stringent degree. However in P4, your ""day"" is chopped into segments sometimes only containing cut-scenes and small dialogue. Other times you have to make decisions that could ultimately be the wrong one, which you can never recover from. Missed something from a previous day? You'll never get it back. I don't enjoy games that encourage you to have to replay them to truly complete them because of game design. If I want to dungeon grind for a while, I should be able to do so. Run out of SP?

The DualShock 3 has always felt like a compromise so small kid hands can hold it.  I think a small kid hand would have trouble with the Pro Elite.The next thing you notice is a step up in quality.  Nearly all the controls on a PS3 controller are progressive / pressure sensitive, and that action feels a lot more definite and well regulated on the Pro Elite.  This is true of the sticks, the 4-pad, and all of the buttons.  The sticks also have better pots - it is much easier to control twitchy games like Afterburner Climax or some of the old arcade adaptations with these sticks.  The rumble is not very strong; I was expecting a beefier rumble than the Dualshock but instead it is noticeably weaker.The major layout difference between the Dualshock and the Pro Elite is that the left stick and 4-pad have switched places.  HAWX 2 uses the left stick as a joystick for aircraft control (aileron/elevator), and frankly you have to hyperextend your thumb.  Combine that with the fact that HAWX uses L1 as a rudder and L2 as a brake, and after an hour piloting, my left hand was cramped and stiff, something that doesn't happen with the DualShock 3.  This lost the Pro Elite one star.Syncing the controller with the PS3 was non-intuitive; there is a little dongle that you have to plug in between the controller and the PS3 and press a button on it for first sync.  Even after that, I was never able to power-on the PS3 with the Pro-Elite; I had to power-on with a Dualshock and then pair the Pro-Elite to use it.  I do not know whether the Pro Elite can be somehow made to power-on the PS3; if it can, it's some arcane secret I wasn't able to learn.  This lost the Pro Elite another star, as it cannot be used as a substitute control.I liked the look of the Pro Elite and the backlit orange glow on the buttons is a definite step up.  Looks exciting, a little diabolical.In summary, better control quality, poorer ergonomics, difficult pairing, doesn't power-on the PS3 by itself, looks cool.  3 stars.

4421,187754,AJ2OU10N9SXF8,B0050SZE2G,Amazon Customer,"[16, 26]","One of the first quotes I heard regarding Far Cry 3 is that it was like ""Skyrim with Guns.""  That perked my interest so I read some previews about the game which said it was very deep in exploration, item gathering and crafting.  I found that to be fairly misleading.  The only craftable items you will gather are plants and animal skins.  That's it.  Plants can be combined to make syringes of various effects such as health restoration, being able to see enemies through walls, resistance to fire, increased damage, etc.  The animal skins are combined to unlock certain perks like the ability to carry more weapons, carry more ammo, carry more loot, carry more money, carry more syringes and carry more grenades.The only other items you can pick up are enemies' weapons, which are almost always worse than what you're already carrying, and loot, which you can sell for money.  So while yes it's a little deeper than a straight forward shooter, the ""Skyrim with Guns"" label does a disservice to Skyrim.  This game is still a shooter, it merely has a couple of extra perks.The enemies also lack in variety.  Outside of one instance which I won't spoil, you'll only ever battle humans and animals.  I'm not sure what else they could have done to provide more variety while keeping the realistic setting, but shooting the same group of tribesman over and over becomes a bit boring, and once you have upgraded all of your gear there's no reason to hunt animals anymore outside of selling their skins, which is less profitable than simply looking for loot.There are a couple of other features that attempt to break up the monotony such as a knife throwing mini game, poker, a ""pass through all the check points in time"" race on ATV's or vehicles, and climbing radio towers which will open up portions of the map and display their loot locations and topography, much like the Assassin's Creed series.  You can also hang glide around the islands which is fairly fun the first few times, but they never really work it in as a mandatory thing for any missions, such as hang gliding into an otherwise impenetrable enemy fortress to raise hell.  I kept expecting that to happen and it never did, it's merely a tacked on feature that serves no real purpose other than taking in the sights and traveling a little faster if you're headed downhill.The guns in the game feel good to shoot but nothing mind blowing about them.  Pistols, SMG's, Assault Rifles, Shotguns, LMG's, Sniper Rifles, bow and arrows, a flame thrower, an RPG and a grenade launcher will be at your disposal, as well as a melee knife.  There are a handful of different guns per category, each of which has different levels of customization such as adding a silencer, extended magazine, scopes, etc.  You can also add a paint job to most guns which shows up on the in-game skin.Leveling up through gaining experience will allow you to unlock perks such as the ability to silently take down enemies from above or below with your knife, silently take down multiple enemies with your knife, reload faster, switch weapons faster, hold your breath longer under water, drag enemies' bodies, acquire more loot, etc.The story line is a bit unbelievable, you seem to be a spoiled rich kid on vacation in the tropics who gets abducted by the local warlord.  You somehow escape and then it's your mission to free your friends and exact vengeance on the warlord.  The problem is that the whiny rich kid instantly knows how to handle all of these weapons like a pro despite no combat experience.  This is partially explained later on in the story but the main character just never felt believable.  The friends you're trying to save also hardly seem worth saving, from the controlling and bitchy girlfriend to the stoner who doesn't want to leave the island anyway.In the end the game is still fun and definitely worth playing because it handles the shooter mechanics well and there's enough of an RPG style system in place to make it more than a mindless shooter.  Running and gunning will get you killed quickly so planning out your assault and using some stealth is ideal in most situations and will reward you with more experience as well as keep you alive.

It takes about 15 in game years to get both farms upgraded 100%. But thats only if you work hard and always make sure you have alot of money to pay for the upgrades as the requests appear each month. You will need to earn over a billion in gold if you are interested in collecting everthing in the game such as the changes in carts and outfits. Here is a method that i used to help speed up the time that it takes to complete things in the game. Keep your work days short do only the things you need to do on your farm and talk to which ever charactor(s) you interact with then skip to the next day. It drasticly speeds things up in the game and makes it more tolerable to play. Also There is a way to control the game days that rain. Put on the wild outfit before you go to bed if its going to rain the next day.

The other characters respond to general orders, however, and have descent enough AI to help you out from time to time.As for the RPG aspects of the game, you're given choices of how to respond to dialogs during conversations and depending upon your answer it can push your towards the dark side or the light side... err I mean a renegade or a paragon (very similar to Knights of the Old Republic; same dialog system). Leveling is also very similar where you only need concern yourself with leveling up one character because the others get the experience regardless. This is nice because you don't want to waste time leveling up certain characters but at the same time it trivializes the whole idea of an experience system.There are some huge flaws which I think this game has (some who play may agree or not here but personally these killed a lot of my enjoyment). The biggest being that while there are tons of side quests and planets to explore... There are barely any enemies on any of the planets. You'll find yourself spending hours in the stupid land rover trying to climb up mountains to get to your destination but never having to fight one living creature most of the time. It's just a huge waste to have a full planet to explore and yet never bumping into any form of life.The next annoyance is the fact that whenever you want to take an elevator (and the game is loaded with these) you have to spend at least 30 seconds on it each time. Forcing the user to sit and wait to go anywhere. Perhaps this is realistic but it's a trivial and useless thing that just wastes the users time and the developers should have given an easy way to skip these.That said, you spend a lot of the side quest time driving around or waiting in elevators so it becomes a bit of a hassle and unless you're a completionist you probably will get bored of the lot of them quickly and give up on the side quests altogether.The main quest, however, is luckily filled with fighting and even the land rover scenes do have a good supply of enemies to fight. The only drawback to the main quest itself is how short it really is. Each main quest area is decent enough but if you remove all the side quests (and the time spent in the elevators) you could finish the game in under a day.That said, it's worth buying if you're into the Action RPG genre and likely will have some fun with the game. You can always ignore the side quests or complete them over time as needed.",3,Mass Effect - Review,1207440000,"04 6, 2008"

Not that they weren't fun, but while they were out I was in college, working a full time job, raising a kid on my own, I just didn't have a lot of time to play.  I'm not whining about that, thats life, but because of that I was more than a bit unforgiving when a game started to feel stale (usually all games about halfway).  I have shelved great games in the past just because I wasn't able to invent enough time to play through the less than exciting middle of games. I have to say that Kingdom Hearts 3d is the first handheld that I have tried that feels like the original ps2 games.  Where 358 might of been sending you on endless missions, Dream drop you get a sense of a deep story line.  I don't just want to pick back up from my last save game, I am have found myself once again finding time in the day to play kingdom hearts dream drop.

I recently finished my first playthrough on normal and the game is a bit challenging early on but after you get to the second act and become geared up in all rares/uniques it becomes a complete CAKEWALK, at least on normal difficulty.I really grew to appreciate the added dodge ability and it can be a lifesaver for classes like the Demon Hunter letting them place a slowing trap while backing up thus making it nearly impossible for non-ranged demons to even stand a chance in most situations.

2162,189609,A369XPXR47NQPZ,B00542ZR4I,Core,"[2, 16]","Okay, going to keep this short, and bitter sweet.Do not buy this game, like at least one more person said, if your easily frustrated, and don't buy this game even if you have a lot of patience, because it will break you and bend you over and pound you when your down on your knees crying.Their is no pause button, and the game, since this is still the 1990's has an auto save feature...No saving at a convenient spot and then dying and going back to that spot and starting over... no sir, that'd be to nice.If you get the urge to use the bathroom at a point where enemies are around, you better hold it unless you want to die. Getting an important phone call that real life is throwing at you? But your in a serious situation in the game, some where your working hard to accomplish a goal? Well the director says tinkle on you... better decide quick!You will have to sacrifice both your real life and your in game life to make it anywhere in this game. Like literally the amount of souls, even with the soul ring.. that they give out is pitiful. So this game requires a TON.. A TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON of time and farming. I can't emphasize this enough. The way the summoning is set up.. its like a gate. If you defeat the boss you can't someone anyone to farm with you. If you defeat the boss though, no one can invade you.. so your humanity is safe.This isn't the first multiplayer game I have played. So I am not going to heap praise on this system like every everyone else, going to go against the flow here. As a matter of fact, it down right sucks. I know there are a bunch of fan boys that would hoop and holler being able to summon friends whenever would break the game. TO them I say, no sir it wouldn't! The system is already in place to summon people, randoms whenever you want, but it sucks and doesn't work all the time. Its already broken.And speaking of summoning, you can only summon people near your rank, so if you want to have your friend who's a higher rank, help you? forget it... want to help your lower ranking friend? forget it. This is truly a broken system. Now the director of the game can state he had this vision that he didn't want ruined, personally I think he wanted to troll people and make money from it at the same time. No seriously, from what I understand the Director was inspired by the ' Berserk Manga Series' its pretty awesome! But even in the dang manga, Gatts has a ton of help from Nakama.Oh also, in this game, YOU CANNOT PARTY CHAT.. I can't emphasize this enough. This game, if you try and go into a freaking party chat it will boot you to offline mode. What a crock of *Insert some serious cursing here since amazon censors or will not allow strong adult language* you know what. So not only will this game not allow you to play with friends unless you get lucky and can summon them.. But it won't even allow you to talk to your friends either..!? (two freaking huge steps backwards for gaming) unless private chat, and then its just one person. I guess the Director was afraid of all the rage combined in one party chat might destroy the universe? Not sure.The gameplay, do you like your character, kicking or doing a plunging attack at the worse possible time? Even though you didn't activate the attack sequence? Yeah, me either. Really makes you rage, when it causes you to get killed. Like your character to start an attack animation that you can't interrupt that causes him to die? Well better get used to it. Welcome TO DARK SOULS.. the game that will indeed turn your soul bitter black.The controls of the game, need re-worked, moves during combat need to be easier to pull off. The programming behind the moves needs to be vastly improved, so that a player doesn't have to fight against the controls.Now to another topic. . . In game experience/resources.The way you level up your character, in game, is you kill enemies, and you gain soul points. The way you level up your weaponry in game, and your armor, is you kill enemies and get soul points.So, we have, You, your weapon, and your armor. That is three things competing for souls. The enemies, are far and few. Your weapons, armor, yourself... all require a ridiculous amount of souls to get anywhere useful. SO, we have a MAJOR, MAJOOOOOR broken game, and this is even with the patches that has come out. You go help someone kill a boss,if your lucky and can get summoned and you might be lucky to pull 15,000 souls or something. And do what with them? Not much, maybe buy a titan shard.. repair your equipment? But that's about all. Its a 3 to 1 ratio not in your favor.You get a 'Covetous Silver Serpent ring', about 3/4 of a way into the game.. which I guess is not accurate since you can go anywhere in the game as long as you can survive. Actually you have access to the catacombs right from the get go, If as a level 1 right at the beginning of the game you can make it all the way to that ring, I commend you! For anyone who has played the game, pinwheel skeletons probably come to mind and a horrible cheap death as well.The thing about it this whole concept of this game.. and summoning system, is its all broken.. its great in theory, but in execution, the game director or whoever was ultimately in charge, didn't have any common sense what so ever... nor good judgement. Now I know a lot of people, or it seems to at least be quite a few, have made the game work, they've beaten it, and probably caused grief by invading others worlds. They have manage to over come all the difficulties, and strive ahead. How? besides the skill part, I would say a bit of dumb luck as well and a ton of time.Armor and skill and weapon attack power play such a crucial role in this game.. and so do ranged attacks with the bow. And you'll constantly be struggling to literally both climb up hill as well as get your gear up to snuff.And it will be a long climb. It will be difficult, and it will not quote :""Extremely Deep, Dark & Difficult - Unforgiving in its punishment, yet rewarding for the determined - learn to strategize freely and conquer seemingly impossible challenges.""Yeah anyone would be happy when torture is over..The enemies have an uncanny ability to lock onto you.. from close combat, to long range combat, not to mention, long range combatants, well their arrows will be slightly homing, thus making them a little harder to dodge, than an arrow that's just going straight like its supposed to.I think the biggest kicker though, is you know those soul's I mentioned? the one's that you use to upgrade yourself, your weapons and armor? Well if you die, they don't stick with you, they fall out on the ground. Now you have once chance to make it back, WITH OUT DYING, to get them back. Because you see, their is no way to store them at the bonfire, or in an item, and losing real time trying to get somewhere in game, is not punishment enough. SO you screw up and lose a lot of souls, you know the one's you were trying to save up to buy an item, or level up? Well YOUR S.O.L!Okay, now onto the good things about the game. Because indeed their are some wonderful aspects to this game.Pros:+You have this massive world that you can't explore, because everything beats you to a pulp, so if you like to explore/adventure? tough poop!+You have a wonderful variety and colorful group of enemies and bosses(some of said bosses are really cheap, actually most of them are in their abilities)+You can have a mishmash of classes.. another words cleric mage, fighter mage, fighter cleric etc.. but you really wont get anywhere, since it takes a ridiculous amount of souls to level up.+You have these wonderful bonfires that you can rest at, but even if your setting at one you can still be invaded if your human by some grief inducing fool.+You can warp amongst bon fires once you manage to get lucky and summon some help to defeat probably the most annoying bossess in the game.. er well, some of the most annoying bosses. That one with the two dogs is pretty bad.Also you can only warp to limited bon fires..not all of them+The Armor sets in this game are truly awesome, and I really do like how you can layer them to get different benefits. That truly is a pro. No sarcasm here this time.+The weapons you can get, quite a variety (and if you can actually find the resources whether its souls or titan chunks or whatever, you can get some pretty cool stuff, good luck heh)If they would fix the multiplayer, the leveling of yourself and your armor and weapons, basically the lack of resources in game... and make it where you could actually grow your character in a consistent time frame...to face the threats that exist. . . (I'm honestly surprised they didn't have micro purchases in this game, they probably wanted to) This struggle for resources is partially what makes this game so freaking difficult. If they made the bosses.. where they were actually on par with you, as opposed to freaks of nature, that would be nice as well. When you face a boss that's literally hopping all over the place, and you can't keep up with ranged weapons, or magic attacks.. etc.. its a real balance issue..So, Welcome to the world of Dark Souls! Try not to go hollow playing this game. Also, might I suggest you buy this as wellEverlast 70-Pound MMA Heavy-Bag Kit. This will save you on LCD TV's and Game controllers.P.S. I never said the game couldn't be beat the way it is. I never said you couldn't make it anywhere in game. You can. It'll devour your real life time like a world eating champ at an all you can eat buffet though.P.s.sIf you want a game that truly rewards you for leveling up your character, and that really gives you a sense of satisfaction as you grow, and has pretty good balance, but not perfect.

7370,82579,AGR4LKC72JEQ8,B000OLSJLC,coopertex,"[13, 20]","Shadowrun is a FPS for the XBOX 360 with some unique elements because it combines magical powers with modern weaponry and fantasy creatures playable as characters in contemporary level maps. One thing that you should be absolutely clear on is that this is an arcadey type shooter, very unrealistic- this is not a simulation like (Graw 2 or Rainbow Six).Even the graphics will cue you in to the fantasy elements since the characters and level maps look cartooney.So you will be shooting guns and killing rival team members with the usual assortment of weapons found in any FPS (pistols, smg, shotgun, sniper rifle, rocket launcher)... but you can also use Magic spells such as ressurecting allied players, summoning minion, teleporting, invisibility,  and many more. You can also purchase Tech upgrades which can help you be more accurate or see enemies through wall, and even speed and agility augmentation. Before the match begins all players are given the option to buy weapons, magic or tech of their choice. The players can budget and accumalate money after each round if they want to buy more expensive items, or they don't have to buy anyhing at all. Once the match begins  and the bullets start flying, you cannot purchase items from the shop until the next round begins (this is why some people associate to Pc game called Counter-Strike).To prevent overuse of magic in the game, you have a meter called Essence which drains and recharges slowly overtime each time you cast a magic spell. When players are short on Essence charge, they can just pull out their guns and start blasting away. If your guns run out of ammo you can resort to your magic spells or you can pick up weapons that a dead ally or enemy had dropped. Everything is about timming and learning the best way to defeat certain opponents.Shadowrun makes excellent use of attacks and counter attacks, every character, weapon and magic has a counter to defeat it, so it is important that your team consists of mixed characters using different magical spells and weapons. Even the characters you pick from have the counters. From the beginning of the game you can pick from one of four different character classes; humans, elves, trolls or dwarves. Each character class has their own strengths and weakness, just like the weapons and magical spells. Humans drain little magic when they use it, elves move fast and regenerate health, trolls can take a lot of abuse, and dwarves can steal other people's Essences.Shadowrun does not have a single player story mode (which is a huge let down) but instead features single player skirmish matches with BOTS and XBOX live multiplayer which is the main draw of the game. There are only three game modes for multiplayer (another let down), Extraction is basically like capture the flag, Raid is like attack and defend, Attrition is same as team deathmatch. The game only has nine (9) damned maps! This unfair to us gamers who paid lots of money for a game that offers very little content!I'm not saying that Shadowrun is not fun, because it actually is fun.The matches are fast paced and full of wild sights! Just picture a game in multiplayer where people and monsters are shooting guns, teleporting, coming back from the dead, getting sliced by sword with blood splattering on the walls!This combination of first person shooting with fantasy elements is what gives it a unique flavor and sets it apart from the many FPS clones out there. However, the lack of game modes and the lack of single player story mode, and only nine maps hurts its overall score and replay value. I think the novelty will wear off on a lot of people faster than other FPS games, but it is still a good purchase, if you are bored and want to try something different.Pros:+playing online is tons of fun+magic spells are freakin' cool+BOTS are good+good controls+bloody+ragdoll physics+good maps designsCons-no sinlge player story mode-only three damned game modes-only nine damned maps-cartoony graphics",3,FPS with Fantasy elements,1180569600,"05 31, 2007"

Frankly, Bungie had let it get pretty stale and that is what 343 inherited. Although there have been some significant improvements in some areas, they usually lose ground in another, which keeps the game from really shining. Some folks have complained about continuity issues such as Master Chief being asleep for over four years, and yet he wakes up with upgraded armor etc. Who cares? I can overlook that, and frankly so should you. If they didn't upgrade them, folks would be pissed about that too. :) So let it go and enjoy the changes for what they are, many of them are good.The good news is that Master Chief is back, and he's ready to kick some tail. The bad news is that the covenant is back too. If you are one of the eight people in the world that still looks forward to seeing them, good for you. But I was thrilled at the end of Halo 3 when Master Chief said--it's over. I'm tired of the covenant and had really hoped they would take the series in a different direction. Yes, they introduced the Forerunners, but they brought back the covenant. Once again--the good with the bad.The weapons have been redone nicely. I've hated the covenant weapons in every game; they have been terrible. But this time around they are actually a pleasure to use, in most instances. And the new Forerunner weapons are pretty cool as well. Now for the bad part: if you really like the UNSC weapons like I do--too bad, because more often than not you won't have enough ammo to hold onto them for long. They seem to have cut the ammo you can carry in most UNSC weapons in half, which makes little sense to me. Spartans can carry untold amounts of weight and armor, but only 32 rounds for their pistol and only a couple of hundred rounds for their assault rifle? Ummmmm, okay. His shields also seem particularly fragile, so don't expect to take too much of a pounding, because you can't.Some folks are a bit upset about the lack of theater mode in Campaign, which is supposed to be added later. So if this feature is important to you, then you've been warned. Personally, I don't care too much. I enjoyed it well enough. It was cool to watch some epic moments in one of your games, but I wouldn't have wanted them to delay release for this.Visual presentation is astounding, and this is one area where the game is NOT showing its age. It is heads and shoulders above any previous versions. Graphics, colors, textures--all gorgeous. Cutscenes are top notch and well done. Sounds have been redone--thank goodness. The assault rifle actually sounds like a rifle now, and the warthog engine rumbles instead of sounding like a battery powered toy. Unfortunately the music score is flat, dull, uninspired and really takes away from the game. Marty O'Donnell did such a fantastic job with the past scores. The music really added to the game. I noticed right away how poorly done this score was, and it hasn't improved in the first five hours.Campaign supports four-player cooperative play--bravo!!! It's well done so far and seems to be noticeably more difficult than previous installments, but that is too be expected with four players. They say it is a 10 hour campaign, but I'm not sure I believe that. We'll see when I'm done.Multiplayer: I've never liked Halo multiplayer. They have one of the most active communities, unfortunately they also have the WORST community I've ever seen. I've encountered more rude, offensive and obnoxious players in Halo games than anywhere else in my multiplayer gaming. So if you enjoy it, I'm sure you'll get plenty of action from this title, but I won't touch it.Spartan Ops: Thank goodness they put something in to support cooperative play beyond the campaign. Well done! And even better is that they got rid of that terrible fire fight mode from ODST and Reach. That was the worst excuse for a game mode I've ever seen. For me, Spartan Ops is what will give this game some longevity, but it remains to be seen how strongly 343 will support it. I really hope they do, and I have faith that they will, but you never know. They may just pander to the multiplayer community and let Spartan Ops fade into obscurity. In the coming weeks I may bump my review up to four stars if this mode continues to impress me, but so far this is a very, very solid three and a half star game but really doesn't do enough to make me want to give it four stars quite yet. Am I being overly critical? Yes, I probably am. I've been playing Halo since the beginning and I have come to expect the best.Good luck spartans.",3,"Franchise is losing steam, but a solid game",1352160000,"11 6, 2012"

However, I was pleasntly surprised. So, without further delay, here is my breakdown of this game.CONCEPT: Lead a 4-man CT (counter-terrorism) team in a variety of missions, including sweep and clear, bomb disposal, and hostage rescue, with a WIDE selection of weapons and gear to assist you.GRAPHICS: Weapon detail is excellent. You can actually &quot;see&quot; the &quot;correct&quot; way to reload the various rifles and pistols in the game. The night and thermal vision modes look very sweet and are actually very useful. Environments are great as well, although tangos look a bit redundant after a while (they either wear leisure suits or Hawaiian shirts. Kinda like blowing away John Travolta or Jimmy Buffett...).SOUND: The weapon's sounds are very authentic. You can tell the difference between an M-4 and an AK-47, as well as the other weapons. Radio chatter amongst teammates is also a tad repetitive, as is tango voices (both living and dying). However, a nice feature is the ability to hear radio chatter only through the headset, which adds to the ambiance and realism (especially when playing alone). Environmental sounds are also very realistic.CONTROLS: Not bad. Tends to be a bit frustrating at first, but you get the hang of it very quickly. Issueing team commands is good either with or without the headset, although without is a bit easier.OVERALL: A good, solid combat/tactical sim worthy of the &quot;Tom Clancy&quot; title. I think that there are a few issues here and there, like not being able to pick your teammate's weapons and gear, or the sometimes dumb mistakes your teammates can make resulting in their injury or demise. Also, it would have been nice to be able to pick your team from a wider pool of operatives (like the PC versions). If you like this type of game, you will not be disappointed. Replay value is good, as trying missions over again with new weapons and tactics is a blast. Military/weapons buffs (like me) will enjoy the realism and there is no shortage of action for the the shooter-game junkies. OK. This concludes my pre-op briefing. Any questions? No? Then you have the green light for insertion. Good luck!",4,"Lock N Load, Gentlemen...",1080604800,"03 30, 2004"
5438,195309,A19OZV4OY58ASH,B006FRNAAE,Gabby_Jay,"[10, 12]","Namco's venerable racer makes its debut on Vita and fades faster than the trails from its tail-lights.Ridge Racer ships with three courses and five cars, attempting a new transaction model to insult the fans of a once flagship series. And not to give Namco too much credit, the tracks aren't even new.Realizing this was a sure-fire way to alienate the few fans remaining, a ""Gold Pass"" is included which features three additional courses, a few more cars, and some new tunes. Only two courses are available in the store at the time of writing. The cars aren't as big of a deal because all cars can be customized and have their drift settings altered.So, that's five courses. Five courses for 30 dollars, with the expectation of more available, for a fee of course, in the future.Give me a @#$&ing; break. Everyone has their own line of bull$@% a developer has to cross before DLC is less of a supplement to the main game and is more of the actual game, and Namco has officially crossed it.Forget the pathetic course selection for a moment, the game also ships with a 299MB patch that's required. Memory = money, and going retail is a way for me to limit memory card usage. A 299MB day one patch is large even for a PS3 title, let alone a Vita game -- a Vita game straight out of the box! After you've downloaded the patch, you get to download the tracks and cars, too.So, let's be clear: the low ranking of this game is strictly because of the transaction model. The entry price for this game should not be 30 dollars. If anything, it should be free to play with the additional tracks coming with a fee. At the least, that would create a bevy of players which would encourage the team warfare Namco is going for in RR.Speaking of Namco's intent, RR is a peculiar addition to the series, focusing on online play and your affiliation with a team that's chosen at the start. The gameplay model has been attempted before with better results (see From Software's excellent Chromehounds), and the foundation is there for something cool; the issue is the game shipped with the ideas half-baked. I like being part of a team; I like working towards a goal with my fellow teammates, but I also like incentive to do so. There's no sense of community in this game; there's no reason to get back behind the wheel to help.You have your five tracks and that's it. Ghost battles, time trial, spot races (one-off races against seven AI opponents) and online battles await you ... but for what? You unlock points as you play to upgrade your car, but the upgrade map is full of filler content, that's not even actual content. You'll have to use your hard earned points to unlock absolutely nothing ... no joke. You unlock a piece of nothing to move on to the next piece of nothing. No artwork. No songs. I would have been happy unlocking a picture of one of the RR devs giving me the finger after an hour of doing this.Anyway, think you'll enjoy online races? Newp. The online play is surprisingly good, but there is no way to filter races. Let me rephrase: you can select rooms that were started by a host at a certain level, but anyone can join the room. As you play, you upgrade your machine, which makes it faster. This is good. What's bad is there's no way to filter out racers who are at a faster level than you, so the online play isn't about skill; it's only about how fast your damn car is. This will no longer be an issue once you're max level, but I've played nearly five hours of offline racing, and I'm just now getting to max speed. I think I am, anyway. Five hours of grinding the same five tracks to be able to enjoy the online portion. I'm surprised this game doesn't kick me in the nuts at random as well. (Also, avoid the 30 lap time trial mode. You get no points. You race for 25 minutes straight and the game rewards you with nothing. Why am I surprised about this?)The core game is still fun. Ridge Racer has always been one of my favorites. The game is 30 fps after the patch, but it isn't locked down. Several racers on-screen can cause it to chug, though overall, it is consistent.  Graphics are great, especially the imagery in the foreground, with sharp textures and nice lighting; background imagery has a soft depth of field effect going on but it isn't distracting. The menus are slick. In fact, the entire presentation is slick. It's just a damn shame the content is so slim and the execution so poor.Namco should be ashamed. I feel like I've been taken advantage of, and not in a way I want to tell my friends about. This series has a solid core fan base and Namco is bending them over, and I was first in line. I didn't even get a t-shirt.",2,Reward Customers by Making Them Pay,1331510400,"03 12, 2012"
11246,98457,A2L7XBXW29NL3V,B000ZKA0KA,R. Rangel,"[1, 1]","Ok, let me start of by saying: I have played dozens of tactical shooters in my life, Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield would have to be the best shooter I've played (online & single player). So I understand how they work...but this game just utterly fails as a tactical-shooter from the start.INSTALLATION:How you ask? Well, for one - once you open the game and pop the disc in, it automatically starts. So what you say? Not when a message tells you, you need to QUIT THE GAME and install it from your XMB...why would they make a game, once you start up you have to quit and install it separately? I mean I don't mind installs, BUT why couldn't they have just made the install while in the game? Doesn't make sense if you ask me, especially since the install is 2 GBs long! But that's nothing too bad, unless you need conserve space. So after that you need to install the patch, which is where the extra 1GB comes from (3GB are needed for the game)...all in all it took about an hour or so and it was 1:00 AM when I finished all that...now comes even more failure...SERVERS:The servers would have to be one of the worst. They tried to make the server lobbies like other PC games, but the thing is this is PS3, you cannot mix PC with PS3. It takes a while to join a game, and at times you can't join a channel - it would tell you that it failed to join and you need to join foreign channels (Japan etc)...you think that's bad? Not even close.GAMEPLAY:The game play is not the worst I have encountered but it is BAD. It is it too slow. Most tactical-shooters are somewhat what you would call slow, but the game play in this is TOO SLOW. There are too many button configurations to do one simple thing. Aiming is a pain, there are 3 types of zoom, but it doesn't work - it's pointless. To switch weapons is also annoying, you can only switch 2 weapons ON-OFF with the L1 button, but to switch to grenades or your secondary weapon you have to hold O move with the D-Pad on what you want, and release O while holding the D-Pad button. What a great concept, especially when you run out of out of ammo and switch and your grenades come up instead of your handgun (while getting shot at) [/sarcasm] - that just takes up too much time! Grenade tossing is a joke, it's like I said, SLOW and the blast is so weak, hardly anyone would die with the grenades you throw at them...The reticule is also a disappointment; when you start shooting your crosshairs jumps all over the place, you cannot really get a steady aim - not even when you are still. And not just that but the 3rd person view just gets in the way...the camera is too close to your character and when you have your crosshairs to the left-right your guy will get in the way the person you are shooting and can't see where he is at; this mostly happens when he is close to you. What a joke! You can also peek left/right by moving the SIXAXIS, but what's the point? It doesn't work with 3rd person shooters like this. Not to mention the response is slow, turning around is a pain since most of the time when I die I get shot from behind and to turn around takes forever, by the time I do I'm already dead. Not to mention there too many glitches in this game, there is lag but nothing too bad just getting in the game sucks. Although the game play is bad, I ended up getting used to it and it was somewhat ""fun"" playing at first, then I got disconnected after an hour playing because of ""server-maintenance"" -- what a crock. Then there are the maps:The maps are too big for the style of the game, too little people hiding and too much time is wasted looking for someone. The spawn points are also ridiculous, you can easily get spawn raped. Not to mention the maps are terribly designed, which moves onto the next flaw.GRAPHICS/TEXTURES:Ok, I usually don't care for graphics in a game, to me it's all about gameplay / story - but since the game play wasn't anywhere near good. I have to look at graphics, which aren't that great either. In fact, SOCOM looks like a beefed up PS2 game. Heck, a majority of PS2 games look much better than this. The texture for the maps were bad, looked really crummy and there was so little detail in the game...I don't know what the real resolution of the game was but I was running it in 1080p and the game still looked choppy.BLUETOOTH HEADSET:You probably already know the game comes with a bluetooth headset, which is awesome at first but somewhat pointless. No one in the game really uses it except clans. I only used it once, and that was in another game. But other than that, it's good to have so you can use on your cell phone - which is exactly how I am going to use mine. The headset is a very sleek design, very cool and not bulky or ugly like other headsets.CONCLUSION:Overall, SOCOM: Confrontation is not the worst game for PS3; with it's outdated, confusing, slow gameplay and choppy graphics...it is pretty bad. Let's just put it this way, Ghost Recon 2 for PS3 was far more worse than this.The game fails to interest, there is nothing new at all. And like I said, it's bad gameplay would probably make you want turn the game off. The sad thing about this is that this was Christmas gift from my brother in which I told him the game was decent the first day I played it, and it was true it WAS decent at first, and within a period of 3 days I have come to dislike the game but NOT hate it...I would probably not pick up and play the game again anytime soon.I would not really recommend this game for a friend or as a gift to someone, it's a game you should RENT before thinking of buying it. In the end, this game fails as a tactical-shooter...they wanted a PC-like-game for the PS3 but it didn't succeed, this is another fail on SONY's part.",2,A Tactical Shooter That Fails...,1230508800,"12 29, 2008"

The Hip Hop Dance Experience has some repetition but it feels more like a casual concert performance with all of the quirks and variations and personal style of the avatar rather than feeling like a choreographed effort.  Whole songs do not feel like that, but their are a few moments like that in each song and it derails my rhythm just enough that I have a hard time getting back on track.The music is ok.  It doesn't have the balance of the Just Dance games, between old and new.  If it did, it might appeal to me a bit more.  I enjoyed the few tracks I recognized (I'm in my late 30's) but there were only a handful and most of the songs were newer, which may appeal to younger hip hop music and dance fans, but I had little interest in trying that many songs that I just don't know (I recognize the artists and song titles, but not the music or at least not enough to propel me through more songs).I think this might be a good match for someone who is more of a current hip hop music fan.

I'm playing it in 3D on a 55 inch Sony LED and the experience is totally immersive. You feel that you're there. I also played the campaign mode of Call of Duty Black ops in 3D and it was OK. But as soon as I fired Crysis 2 and you get the suit and the HUD display on your helmet is activated, I was speechless. The info displayed by the helmet feels like it's literally right there in front of you, floating in mid air, and you can almost touch it. And further in your field of vision, you see your weapon, crystal clear and when you aim down the sights, it's just perfect. I wish black ops looked this good in 3d. The only game that comes close to the 3d experience Crysis offers in killzone 3.As for the story, it reminded me a lot of the convoluted metal gear story lines, but I enjoy that kind of thing. I also though it was pretty cool that you get to absorb the very thing that makes your enemies powerful (a type of alien virus) and assimilate it in the suit making you, more powerful. The suit powers are awesome and the gun play is a blast.My favorite thing is popping headshots using the Ranged Scar. A scoped weapon that when you aim and look down the sights, specially in 3D, and you put that thin crosshairs from a distance on the heads of you enemies, makes you feel like the freaking weapon is actually in your hands.And I loved that they kept the Call of Duty control scheme intact. From minute 1, I was able to crouch, melee, shoot and evade baddies effortlessly, without even thinking, and without having to get used to a whole new control scheme. COD Is the most popular shooter on the planet whether you like it or not. I hate it when games like killzone try to go all rebel and different on you just for the sake of it and switch how crouching or aiming work unnecessarily, just to go against the mainstream. Playing FPS games is like driving. Why do some developers like to make me learn how to drive all over again just to play their game?

Since this is almost just a little repeat of the first it makes the first pretty much useless (unless you want just a few different options).Other than that small complaint this is a pretty good game. I'm usually picky about my 'personal' choices of shooter games (either FPS of 3PS) but I do like this. It has a guided lock on type mechanism which helps you shoot (which is always good in a 3PS). It doesn't lock on to enemies, it just helps you by leading the target some if you have them in a general sight range and they're strafing. There's quite a bit of versitility except no customations (which is fine). It's a mild paced game, not that slow to bore most players, but not to crazy for some to die all the time and not even know what hit them.

So why only 2 stars you might ask?Well first off, (MESSAGE TO SONY!) for the love of god, make the Move controls customizable!  Especially the move controls!  I don't care how well you think the controls work for you, they may not make sense to anybody else.  And with every other developer thinking they know the best way to map them, they are always different from game to game.  Look, you have X amount of buttons to map to, and the SAME X amount of commands available; how hard is it to let the user decide how they want play the game?  PC games have been allowing this since the beginning of PC games.  Please take note!Also, whatever stupid slowdown algorithm they use when zooming in absolutely does not work with the move.  I have tried every combination of settings and still can't look down the sights and enjoy it.  Get rid of that for the move!  I take off 2 whole stars for those two problems alone.Everything else is pretty enjoyable when you put down the waste of money that is the move controllers and sharpshooter.  The game plays pretty well and is always action packed.  The graphics and sound are top notch, especially with the intensity of everything going on.  The cooperative and multiplayer are also very fun.The story is very mediocre though, as is any FPS game like this.  It basically boils down to go from point A to point B while shooting everything in sight.  I think the whole point of the game is to give your little kid back the mitten he dropped in the beginning of the game?  I honestly stopped caring, and there is nothing memorable in the story to follow.The game is also extremely easy on the hardest difficulty.  Well maybe not extremely easy, but at no point did I feel really challenged.  The AI is laughable too.  At times they will be standing right next to you, but not even see you at all.Also, the giant middle finger from Sony charging you $10 for an online pass... WTF?  Here is a giant middle finger back at you!  Granted you get a free pass when you buy the game, but if you just happen to be a person that is renting it then you are S.O.L.

Climbing buildings, jumping from roof to roof, taking leap of faith etc. can be real fun.OPEN WORLD: I truly like open world games. Between three major cities, there are plenty of open world exploration you can do. My favorite part was to get on top of tall buildings and just admire the beauty of the well designed cities.TOOLS FOR ASSASSINATION: As the title of the game implies, it is about assassinating targeted individual and to do so, they give you some pretty good weapons. My favorites are hidden blades. Loved taking down enemies with them.STORY: Have to say, the game has somewhat confusing, but never the less decent story. Can't tell you much without spoiling it.CONS.EXTREMELY REDUNDANT MISSIONS: I was expecting they will challenge you with variety of assassination mission, however, most of them are exactly the same. Unfortunate part is they are also very easy. So the first few assassinations were fun; however, after that I was bored to death killing the targets same way over and over again. And difficulty only increases slightly from initial missions to later missions.EXTREMELY REDUNDANT CHORES: In order to get your mission,  you have to do some chores. These chores are EXACTLY THE SAME IN ALL CITIES. By the time you finish the game, you will hate them.ANNOYING CHORES: Some chores involve annoying task like collecting the flags. HATE IT, ABSOLUTELY HATE IT.LIMITED VARIETY IN WEAPONS AND UPGRADES: They have few different weapons and upgrades for these weapons, but I was expecting more. Much more.LIMITED VARIETY IN ENEMIES: There are very few different types of enemies in the game. Again, I was expecting a lot more.ANNOYING CHASES: So after you assassinate someone, you get chased by the guards, very understandable. If you get caught in public doing something stupid, you get chased, acceptable. Initially, all of these didn't bother me, but as the game get more and more redundant, these chases started to annoy me more and more. What was fun before, became torture now.WATER = INSTANT DEATH: What the...?? You are master of so many different weapons and skills, but you can't swim!!!! This would not be a problem if some missions and assassination required travel over the water.To me, Cons easily outweighed the Pros and what was supposed to be an enjoyable experience, turned out to be a great punishment.

I was excited as hell for Capcom's release of Mega Man 9, but with the 360 the D-Pad is too terrible to play it with, the PS3's controller created too much lag for it to be accurate when jumping platform to platform or turbo shoot (u know; old school push the fire button like a madman), and I don't have a Wii so my hopes for a good side scroller were sadly gone. Then I got this and Holy Crap! Shadow Complex blew my mind. I've wasted hours on this game and it was worth every bit of my life I'll never get back. This game has excellent pacing. It's not too hard and not too easy. It was like a mix of Bionic Commando and Metroid. You go through sections of this complex, much like levels in Metroid and have the capabilities (as you upgrade) of Samus, Sonic the Hedgehog (I'm sure there is a better example, but nothing is coming to mind), and Nathan Spencer. The gameplay was a blast. There's not much to the story, but this is a game that doesn't really need a lot of story.

I mean you can't expect it to compare to Gears 2 or COD4: MW, but it's exceptional for a game that's only for download and set a new benchmark for XBLA file size. Oh speaking of the file size. Make sure you have the HDD space for this. It's pretty hefty, 835 mb. So it's going to take up a bit of space, but totally worth it. The only thing that would have enriched the experience is if there was a co-op story mode, but this game wasn't designed around that, so maybe with the next one.

I played the game for two days and im already sick of the maps.none of the maps really have any kind of a THEME like black ops does (like black ops has a golf course or missle launch site, etc)intermissions: same as before, the game still always makes you wait a full, long, 60 seconds in between games, even when everyone is ready to play.its so dumb, because if you need an intermission, YOU CAN JUST LEAVE THE LOBBY and give one to yourself. why they dont realize how dumb theirintermission system is, i dont know. so usually if you dont want to wait, you end up quiting during intermission to find another game ready to go,and end up joining the game right as its about to END. so you just cant win.server issues and lag:which brings me to other issues. the game will try to put you in a game in progress often times, and load it up for like I dunno, FOREVER, and thencome back and say, lost connection to host. THERE IS NEVER A WAY TO ABORT JOINING A GAME, There is no manual override.So if its taking FOREVER and you know its going to error out(some server error), you still cant do ANYTHING about it except wait, which is really dumb.My nat is moderate or open on every other fps i own, including black ops, but on this game the nat type is always strict!it tells you to go to [...] for help. all that does it give you a link to router companies websites!it doesnt ever tell you anything about opening certain ports on your router! you have to bypass your router to get anopen nat, and even then there is still lag! lag ruins this kind of game!when you play, you often get a lot of lag, and the game is often so dumb it often WONT EVEN TRY to migrate the hostwhen it obviously needs too since you have obvious lag. other timesit keeps migrating the host like constantly, maybe 3 or 4 times until it finally gets it right. other times the game will be over but before you can get the score to displayit stops and says MIGRATING host and makes you wait just to be free to quit and find another lobby to join.it doesnt seem to matter about your connection either, because i bypassed my router to get an open nat and i STILL had lag.its something else, probably has alot to do with who is actually hosting the game. 99% of the time i had some type of lag.This bug existed before in mw2 too, its like using the same exact engine as mw2. the bug is, alot of times, but notconsistantly, just alot of times: you will be low on ammo, go to reload, and it will show your dude reloading, andwhen he is done, you still have NOT reloaded-and you need to reload yet AGAIN in order to actually reload!pros:they added alot of killstreak awards, though only a few are cool.they let you change killstreaks per each loadout.they let you choose when to use which killstreak award, it doesnt have to be ""use last one(acheived) first"" anymore(it depends on which killstreak it is, some do require you to use it last one first).survival mode:aside from it being 2 player max which is pretty lame.it takes a long time to find a player to play with(cuz many will just quit), then theres a stupid built in 30 second intermission when you do, as if itdidnt take long enough to find a player, now it forces you to wait longer! how dumb is that!all the enemies show up on the minimap which also makes it too easy sometimes.it lets you call in an AI squad to help you fight the AI, which is dumb-because why would you want AI allies to help you killother AI enemies? and if your teammate calls them in you cant prevent it. Its like letting the computer play against itself. If you are playingits because you want to shoot at things, not watch the AI troops shoot other AI troops, wow!if theres any lag for 3 seconds it will stop the game and wont let you continue on solo either.if your teammate sucks and keeps dying you must keep reviving him or else you LOSE. you cant just finish the roundby yourself like you can in black ops zombies.----back to multiplayer:doesnt stop to balance teams on team matches, like when its 6 people vs 2 people for instance, it just keeps going like that!!lame!!!still bs miracle kills from them while you shoot them plus claymore them and they survive and run away or shoot you twice and kill you insteadstill appears to be a miss but counts it as a hit ,especilly with snipersflashbangs still burn your eyes out instead of just turning screen black or something (trying to be too realistic in annoying ways)still wont just let you spectate without kicking you outchanged from 2 claymores at one time to only one like blak ops. why!all knife weapons still too strongonly one setting for sound instead of different types of sound like black ops hasadditional issues:can see thru walls sometimes, glitchysome cover provides no protection at all, some weak cover (like glass that never breaks)provides way too much protectionthey kill with one or two shots after taking huge damage and no shields could possibly be obtained yetwhen it recovers from host mirgration, you can lose effects and messes up gamedoesnt count kills toward streak sometimes, especially if it happens rite before you dieprone still can get stuk way too easily and you cant turn, as if your virtual body has no JOINTS in itsometimes you get completely stuck on pixels of things like cranes forklifts random obstacles, etccant jump on top of almost anything depsite it being lowgun still auto changes when it gets empty, so if you try to change guns manually you end up with the same empty gun again!!javelin appears huger than a man on screen,blocks view etc!javelin only weapon that doesnt change to full gun when empty sometimes wowjavelin will often hit the ceiling and kill u but not themno MUTE all STILL, so if you want to mute people you have to do it one at a time constantlythe speaker icon when people yap, is in bad place -its annnoying seeing speaker icon come up on your screenwhen you try to mute people it unmutes other people at the same time, must be a glitch/bug.ONE OF THE DUMBEST things in the game- you can lay down and walk into fire!!!!!wow, does that fact alone just sum up how lame this game is?you can crawl thru dead bodies and you have to because they dont disapear fast enoughno access to all maps unless you play team games, really dumb ideathe maps are all boring and lack any themes, most have few rooms to even to go into.overall, black ops is a much better game, and zombies is way better than survival mode. the best thing about survival mode is you can get sentry guns.i wish zombies had sentry guns in it haha.i hope you appreciate the time i took to write you this review, so click ""yes it was helpful"" below somewhere.i know there are tons of other reviews though, but mine is probably the most detailed!",1,same old broken mw2 engine.ps3 has nothing but lag on multiplayer,1321747200,"11 20, 2011"

I'm saying it does track your motion in a very precise way (in most cases) so you will really have fun on it. This can be a revolution of gameplay for the coming years.The system takes quite a long time to set up and adjust because the system takes quite a while to recognize you. Another problem is you must keep your room's lights in a fix condition. We set up the system with 3 light sources on, then we turn of one light, then the lag is much more notable. Same result when we keep the amount of light but change the location of light source. So note this, this guy is fairly light sensitive.Talking about the lag, it depends on games. With the ""sonic rider"", there's no big deal of lagging. However, for the included ""adventure"" game, the time between your motion and the motion on the screen can be as big as 0.5 sec, which is very frustrating occasionally.The biggest issue for kinect right now is it lacks supporting games.

7667,120223,A1Y7JKCYPRXPNW,B001QXNBJM,"R. Whitelaw ""Rebel Broker""","[5, 7]","I have been kicking around in the Battlefield franchise for a long while now. It all started with Battlefield: 1942 and kept my attention for other releases such as Battlefield:Vietnam, Battlefield 2 and Battlefield:2142. Once you add in all the various expansion packs, that is a heck of a lot of Battlefield! I skipped the first Bad Company release, but have been completely won over by the latest addition to the franchise, Battlefield: Bad Company 2.Unlike some of the older entries in the Battlefield franchise, this one sports a robust single player campaign in addition to its unique online gameplay. Before we get into that, lets talk about some of the common features.Graphics:You will not be disappointed here. Characters and environments feel as real as they come in any game. From dust storms in the desert maps to snow drifts on the arctic maps, you get a good feel for the maps as you play them. Render distances are amazing here. On maps that are free of fog or other line of sight limiting factors, you are going to be able to see enemies at amazing distances. With the 12x scope on my sniper rifle, I have been able to spot pinhead sized enemies and engage them, but more on that later!I have been playing regularly and have not experienced any issues aside from a handful of aesthetic snafus like rocks that seem to hover off the ground by a few inches.SINGLE PLAYER:I am only a few hours into the single player story line, but so far, I am enjoying the challenge. You start the story as a WWII soldier on a mission which ends with some sort of secret weapon reveal. I am not sure what the thing is yet, but I like where things are going. One of the best parts of the single player game play is sitting back and listening to the verbal interactions between the other members of your team. Take the time to sit idle just before a checkpoint and wait for the chatter to get going - you won't regret it.MULTI-PLAYER:This is where things get good.  Where BC2 really shines is in its multi-player action. Many people are going to be comparing this to the record breaking Modern Warfare 2. In many ways, BC 2 offers us game play that is simply not available in Modern Warfare 2. Since this comparison is one folks are likely to not only make, but want to see, let me break it down:- MAP SIZE: BC2 supports much larger maps. As mentioned earlier, you can be on a map in BC 2 and have enemies so far away that even when using a 12x scope, they appear to be rice grain sized. You simply do not get this kind of scope in Modern Warfare 2. The battles feel far more encompassing and involved in BC2.- VEHICLES: BC2 has a wide variety of vehicles you can jump into and pilot. Whether we are talking land, sea or air vehicles, BC2 has something for you. Even if the idea of risking your virtual skin in an actual aircraft worries you, there are UAVs you can pilot around. Nothing like this exists in Modern Warfare 2 aside from the killstreak awards you get in the form of Predator missles, AC130 airstrikes, etc. Aside from the ones I have mentioned and perhaps a couple of others, these awards in MW2 are not even ones where you get to do the shooting yourself.-SNIPING: Whenever I jump into one of these games, I usually gravitate toward the sniper or recon class. This is probably the only area where I think that BC2 has missed the boat. While you can go prone in MW2, you cannot in BC2. The closest you can come in BC2 is crouching. While this is going to annoy any aspiring sniper at first, you will slowly but surely find yourself being won over enough to overlook this horrible gameplay sin by everything else that BC2 has to offer.- PHYSICS: BC2 takes the prize in this category. First, there is fairly realistic bullet drop in BC2. If you explore the sniper route as I have, you will eventually be making some amazing shots at astounding ranges, only after you have mastered the ability to compensate for bullet drop. Once you do, you are going to have more ""I cannot believe I made that shot!"" moments than you can count. There is nothing quite like lining up your shot on a target that appears no bigger than the head of a pin and firing off one shot and getting the satisfying points report that you have made a headshot! The physics does not end there. Just about everything in this BC world is destructible. I don't just mean a little bit destructible either. Buildings can be completely brought down with enough damage. Trust me, nothing creates an ""Uh oh."" moment more than hearing an explosion nearby followed by the creaking moan of the building you are inside just before it collapses on you! Whether it is a pesky tree blocking your view of a likely enemy route of approach or a shack, you can deal with it with some well placed explosives or calling in a mortar strike to clear your line of sight!- GAME MODES: Multiplayer offers conquest and rush modes. Conquest is the classic most are used to. A series of areas to capture and hold. Rush offers an ever evolving battlefield. Once you destroy the ""Widget"" at points A and B, then the battle advances to the next area with two more targets to be attacked. One side in offense, the other in defense.  This play mode is well developed and the maps provide different types of challenges. I found myself enjoying rush a lot more than I expected, having really grown comfortable with the conquest style of gameplay.- HARDCORE: Hate killcams, higher hit points and slowly autohealing? Then hardcore mode is for you. Nothing will ruin a snipers day quicker than your position being given away after every kill. The real gaming goodness is to be had on the hardcore servers. However, if your an assault kinda guy who loves jumping into the fray with your automatic weapon blazing away, you will get lots of fun in the normal mode.- ACHIEVEMENTS: Both MW2 and BC2 have tons of achievements and un-lockables. You are not going to feel left out regardless of which world you choose to fight in. However, MW2 does let you pick special graphics and icons to go with your online character once you earn them. I think this is kind of cool and enjoy that little customization - which is not available in BC2.So is this game going to be good for everyone? I would say yes actually. If you are brand new to first person shooters and feel a little intimidated by the online multiplayer facet, you can play through the single player story line and end up with a very good comfort level with all the weapons.  With the single player game under your belt, you should be well equipped to start enjoying online play with others. If you are looking for your first game of this type and are trying to decide between BC2 and Modern Warfare 2, let me suggest that you go ahead and start with BC2. There is just more to do in the BC2 world. Don't get me wrong, MW2 is an outstanding game and one I am sure to go back to time and again - even with BC2 in the rotation. However, if you are just starting out, I think you are going to get more enjoyment out of BC 2 to start off.Parents thinking about buying this for younger children should think about that. There are grown up words being used in the single player story line. Online play means that your child is potentially being exposed to every smut mouthed teenager (and 'Grown Up' for that matter) out there. Consider carefully if that kind of thing is appropriate for the child you are shopping for. The violence is what it is. You can shoot, knife, blowup and drive over just about anyone. However there is no real gore. The closest you get is a pink ""poof"" when someone is shot.Downloadable content is already on the way for Bad Company 2. The best part is that if you  bought the game new, you will get these new maps for free!So why did I take away a star? The prone thing. That still just annoys me and is the one glaring thing in this game that simply makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. I imagine a meeting in which folks argued that allowing going prone would prolong gameplay and make sniping too powerful. Of course, all those folks are wrong and need to make going prone possible.

No. If you're looking for chills as opposed to thrills, seek out any of the Fatal Frame or Silent Hill series.But if you've played all of those and are looking for something to tide you over until the PS2 release of Resident Evil 4, then consider the often-overlooked 'Clock Tower 3'. Set in England, you play Alyssa (what is it about that name and the Survival Horror genre??), a fifteen year-old schoolgirl on the trail of her missing mother, travelling through time and reality and evading the unwanted attacks of a number of ghosts and serial killers.GRAPHICS: 5Beautiful big characters, gorgeous scenery and excellent design make this one a pleasure to watch. Some of the lowlier ghosts are a bit chintzy (but after all, they can be dispersed with a ""Sentimental Item"", so what was I expecting??) and the overall visual impression lacks a Horror-style punch, but what the game does, it does very well.SOUND: 3Average music and average sound effects provide the backdrop for some of the most outlandishly bad voice acting in a video game. Ever. Remember Resident Evil 1? ""It's. A. Monster. Run. "". This is worse. Cheesy and OTT with no effort given to atmosphere, this really does drag the game atmosphere right down.PLAYABILITY: 4There are no weapons and no means of killing your pursuers until the actual boss battle, so running and hiding and using pre-set 'Evade' points is a very fun way of keeping Alyssa alive. Also this adds to the tension like nothing I've ever seen before. Simplistic controls and a really good camera system kae this one good fun to play, even if it does get a bit repetitive later on. Nothing to upgrade and plenty of special items means that there's no real challenge, though.LASTING FACTOR: 2This is a very short (4 hours and sixteen minutes first play, subsequent plays are less), very easy game. The final Boss is a b*stard to beat, and you need to keep every single special arrow you find in the game to even be in with a chance - he is unfairly tough, given the game's remedial difficulty levels. Replay value is low - though there is a replay mode, but it's not that different from the actual game.OVERALL: 3Fun, flashy, and tense, this is a great deal if you can get it cheap. What it does, it does very well, and even though it's a total one-trick pony, the fact that it's so short means it never becomes stale.

If you speed up, they speed up. In theory, this keeps races close, and exciting.In Sled Storm, it makes them obnoxiously difficult, and takes any semblance of &quot;fun&quot; out of racing. It takes the &quot;race&quot; out of racing, in fact. You can hit every shortcut, every turbo boost, and not make a single mistake throughout the entireity of a 10 minute long race, and if you make a minor mistake at the end, you can go from 1st place to 6th in less than half a second, with no way to recover. This isn't an issue of making a huge mistake, and falling behind, it's an issue that no matter how well you know a track, and can exploit it, you'll *never* get more than half a second ahead of last place.As a result, Sled Storm isn't a racing game, it's a game about not making any mistakes, ever. It's not fun, it's not interesting, it's a horrible way to have implemented the computer &quot;AI&quot;, and it makes the game so utterly pointless and worthless that it's not likely I will ever play it again.",1,"The worst computer &quot;AI&quot; in any racing game, ever.",1034726400,"10 16, 2002"

So I'm reviewing this game on face value and not taking into account how this game has aged or how it may have compared to games back when this was released. As always my video game reviews revolve around 3 things. Story, Gameplay, and characters with order of importance in that order. For reference I played this game on Steam.Story: 7/10The story was great. As usual Bioware does a good job on the story and the progression. It kept me interested all the way through. The difficult decisions without the knowledge of how it would impact my future was greatly appreciated and provided another level intensity. The constant irritation with political motives versus what is good for the galaxy kept things interesting all the way through. There really isn't anything to criticize about the story. It wasn't completely epic or anything but just a good overall story. Like I said it kept my interest. Was it the best story ever? No but it was good.Gameplay: 5.5/10This may be the weakest portion of the game. It's possibly because this section has not aged well but there are several weaknesses to the game. The mining for minerals portion of this game was rather boring and really was just a giant time suck. The number of items you picked up in this game was ridiculous. You were constantly picking up weapons and armors and upgrades to the point where they just became way too much to deal with and you were tempted to just sell everything to clear room. While the weapon system wasn't too bad, the ammo system was awful. You had to constantly switch back and forth between different types of ammo depending on what type of enemy (synthetic vs. organic) you were fighting. And when you have 50 different ammos..it can be rather difficult to swim through all of them to find what you want. Overall the gameplay wasn't awful and for the timing of the release it may have been really good...but after a while some of the elements of the gameplay just became taxing and distractingCharacters: 7/10The characters weren't overly bad but weren't overly good either. My favorite characters were easily Wrex and Tali with Garrus being pretty good as well. However, the human characters, with shephard included, were just overly boring. Williams was the best of the three but to a larger degree all three playable humans were just stale. Shephard was almost robotic as far as emotions at some points. Character development was average. Some characters had really interesting backgrounds while some were snooze fests. Some characters were so boring an uninteresting that I couldn't force myself to care about their backstory (here's looking at you alenko). The supportive characters were pretty good..namely joker. Overall the characters weren't awful but weren't really noteworthy either.Overall: 6.5/10Overall this game was pretty good. If you can get through it before some of the gameplay elements start to really tax you, this game is rather enjoyable. If you are a fan of RPG's and well developed stories, do yourself a favor and give it a shot. Play it on steam though.",3,Great story that started the franchise.

But in my opinion, it does not offer a lot of improvement in gameplay/gamefun.  The graphics are better than ever and the in-game map editor is a welcome addition.  So much for the good news.  Frankly, I like good graphics, but it's the -game- I'm interested in.  I find the tech tree too long and  needlessly complex.  The number of combt units seems excessive and you really have to advance pretty far to get to the good ones; the advance from one unit to the next higher one gives you a marginal increase, at best.  After a while, I found myself wondering ""what's the point?""  City management is best done using the AI, otherwise it's too troublesome - unless you really like micro-management.  The editor in Civ 3, while limited in some ways, seemed (to me) easier to figure out than the edit functions available with Civ 4 (except for, as noted, the in-game map editor function).  Never could figure out how to edit individual Civ4 units.Overall, I did not find the game as fun to play as Civ 3.

10453,112513,AMZCQIDUWDHLC,B001CYBXMC,John. N,"[0, 0]","During my later grade school years, the 16-bit machines were at the height of the industry. To most, and because of Sega's more than successful advertising, the in-thing was to own a Sega Genesis over a Super Nintendo. Seriously, anyone who grew up during this era has to remember that the ""Genesis did what Nintendon't."" While the Genesis would be doomed to live out its final days as the guinea pig for failed add-ons, I have to admit there were Genesis titles I was fond of despite my love for the Super Nintendo.As if one has to guess, Sonic the Hedgehog was at the top of that list, and at the top of the Sonic the Hedgehog list was Sonic 3. While I can't remember what I had for breakfast yesterday, I can sure as hell remember playing the hell out of this game during the brief time I had access to Genesis when my friend and I temporarily traded consoles in the sixth grade. As blasphemous as some would consider it, Sonic 3 ultimately became the Sega equivalent of Donkey Kong Country to me, easily amongst the best titles the console had to offer. Yet, of course, my friend and I would eventually reacquire our respective consoles and thus I wouldn't touch Sonic 3 - let alone a Genesis - for more than a decade.Fast forward to 2010 and I would again procure a Sega Genesis and Sonic 3. Needless to say those fond memories of playing the game remained crystal clear in the back of my mind and I was more than looking forward to reliving what I considering a gaming triumph. Unfortunately, a decade is a sizable portion of time and one can only imagine how many games I encountered and played within that frame of time - especially with the lifespan of the original PlayStation in there. So here I was, Sonic 3 in hand once again. Would it live up to the memories? Could it? I was more than curious, I was ecstatic.So what do I think of Sonic 3 now? Well, the game is as beautiful now as it was back then (at least graphically), but time has certainly thrown it two cents into the equation. For better or worse, Sonic 3 is not the juggernaut I remember. Sure, it's enjoyable but there are several things about the Sonic formula that are way more apparent now than they were back in 1994. The first (and most surprising) is how the game's sense of speed systematically puts a limit on exploration. There are tons of hidden areas within each zone (some of which lead to the insanely awesome Chaos Emerald levels) and their respective acts but there's always an abstract force that constantly reminds you this is not your objective. The levels may be huge and ingeniously designed but with the speed fed ""drive-by"" approach so ingrained in the gameplay you never truly get to experience your surroundings like you would in a Mario game. I'm sure to some I'm missing the point but the game obviously wants but can't seem to juggle both.The game also runs into a hitch with Knuckles the Echidna. As a character, I really love Knuckles despite his lack of development here. And that's the problem. I can't fathom introducing such a clever creature and only using him as a prop. This is what makes Sonic 3 feel unfinished in more ways than one, something that was more than proved when Sonic and Knuckles came out. This and the final zone somewhat unhinge all the good the game manages to do with it's new trio of elemental shields, the previously mentioned Chaos Emerald levels and the soundtrack which skillfully hides the deficiencies of the Genesis' sound processor.When all is said and done, if you still have access to a Sega Genesis it goes without saying that any of the cartridge based Sonic titles would make worthy additions to any growing collection. Still, as should be more than obvious to anyone that's lived a few decades, just be aware that current realities may not much up to the rosy images that have been taking up residence in your mind since your last playthrough. That said, it's somewhat revealing that I feel I have to tread with caution within the era that's billed as the ""golden age of Sonic.""",4,"Good, but not as good as I remember...",1318896000,"10 18, 2011"

1595,45179,A2OAG0NE83ODBD,B0001CJCE2,Rachel Higgins,"[1, 2]","This game had many faults in my opinion. There was almost no storyline. You could talk to characters to play minigames, solve puzzles and problems, and move to new areas, and although they gave you a necessary collectible item, they had no affect on events in the storyline. In fact, only Hunter, Spyro, Sparx, Professor, and Red had any effect on the main storyline. Only Spyro, Professor, and Red would be considered main characters. As for the actual characters, about seventy-five percent or more had annoying voices, comments, characteristics, speech, ways of talking, mini games, puzzles and problems, and tasks. Some had five out of seven annoyances. It made you not want to even bother listening to most the characters. The mini games were usually terrible. With Sparx you had to avoid getting squashed, crushed, eaten, run over, or attacked more than three times. You had about three weapons, but usually only the standard weapon was useful. You could speed up or slow down, but only temporarily. The last Sparx games were easier than the first ones since all you had to do was shoot and dodge enemies instead of also avoiding obstacles and opening doors in addition to fighting. Blink's mini games were also boring, since basically you either shot, squashed, tackled, or bombed enemies. Most could be shot far away by zooming in, so the only challenges were making sure you didn't get to close to some enemies, jumping at the right time for something to land or grab on to, and having bombs left over to destroy the dark gems. St. Byrd mini games were a little better, though not much. Basically, you used bombs and missiles to destroy enemies who often couldn't fight back, and either targets or cannons. You also flew through gates and hoops. Spyro's mini game was the worst, if that is possible. You aimed and fired at a certain amount of enemies before they killed, passed, or stole from you. Hunter's game play was okay, but usually you could zoom and shoot enemies before they knew you were there, so the main obstacle was not falling off a cliff or getting knocked off one by an obstacle. Spyro's adventure mode was fun since you could use electric, fire, water, and ice breath and bombs, charge, and horn dive enemies while gliding, jumping, or running to defeat enemies. Environments were varied and skills could be learned from elders. Some of the puzzles were boring, but for most part, playing Spyro or one of the other two dragons was fun. Objective is to destroy dark gems and collect eggs and light gems throughout game. Overall, Spyro was fun, mini games were boring, most characters were annoying in one way or another, and the storyline was too short and silly. If you want Spyro with more action(combat), realistic graphics, good characters and storyline, and no mini games, try the legend of spyro trilogy. It focuses more on fighting, than exploration and puzzles, but is much better(especially for kids older than ten or younger kids who like action without blood).",1,Spyro:a Hero's Tale,1260662400,"12 13, 2009"

They have used a 3D interface, but the graphics suffer for that.  It would have perhaps been better to use 2D graphics.  The graphics are reminiscent of Final Fantasy VII, even though that was made four years earlier.  The 3D interface is very cool however.  You can spin most rooms around to take any perspective.  This is useful for spotting hidden objects.  I wish all 3D games would allow you to view from all perspectives!  You can also sometimes 'zoom out' to get an overview of the area.  The effect is actually quite breathtaking if you can get into an overlooking tower or high building and especially at the monastery.  So that's a positive.Story:  The story at first seems very simplistic and made-for-kids.  The protagonists are all teenagers and they tend to view things in a childish way.  However, the subject matter is very rich and sometimes dark.  It's very interesting to combine adult subject matter with a childish viewpoint.  It really produces a strong emotional effect.  The children can't fully comprehend these situations, but YOU as the player can!  What you do in this game is to travel to many different islands and continents where you will have to solve their specific issues.  So it is more like a collection of short stories than one big story (although there is an overarching theme connecting the smaller stories).The townspeople are very talkative!  They will usually change what they say after very small story events.  So if you are big on talking to the townspeople, you should check for fresh responses often.  There is a huge, huge amount of dialogue here!  As an added bonus, after talking to each townsperson, try talking to your companions.  They will sometimes generate a unique response to each townsperson's response.Gameplay: Excellent!  That essential Dragon Warrior feeling is there.  As you wander over the world map or in dungeons, you will be attacked by random, wandering monsters.  You kill the monsters to gain experience and gold.  You take the gold to nearby towns to exchange for better and better weapons and armour.  You will have to make tough choices as to which weapons and armour you can buy with limited funds.There have only been a couple places so far where I had to level grind in order to progress.  (By level grind, I mean setting time aside to raise levels before moving on with the story.)  This is very different from Dragon Warrior (original) where you had to level grind all the time!  I like it!  The story seems to flow very smoothly instead of start/stopping all the time like in the original.In order to progress the story, you must find shards that you put into special altars.  If you do not have all the shards you need to reach the next area, you will be stuck until you locate them.  It is therefore important to explore every nook and cranny possible in every town and dungeon you are given access to.  This comes naturally to me in my own style of RPG playing.  Most RPGs make this optional to find all of the hidden treasures and goodies, but in this RPG you must seek them out so as to avoid missing a shard.  If you are thorough in your searches, you should be able to avoid missing a shard and getting stuck.At a certain point in the game, you will be able to choose classes.  There are some standard kinds of classes, like fighter, mage, cleric, etc.  There are also some offbeat ones like jester and shepherd.  It's fun to choose a class and learn its unique abilities.  However, your stats are sometimes negatively affected by a class choice.  For example, choosing to be a mage will lower your attack and defence power, but raise your intelligence for magical attacks.  For this reason, I felt that choosing classes made gaining levels from experience somewhat irrelevant.",5,Excellent!,1330473600,"02 29, 2012"

Since the system features and functionality are easily found from other reviews and various web sites, I won't comment on these. I would like to share my thoughts on the bronze version of this unit based on personal experience.When I was looking to purchase this item, I was undecided between the blue and bronze. Surprisingly, there are limited number of photos/videos on the web for bronze; many look different than what it actually looks in terms of the color depth. The product box itself does not show the overall color scheme very well, which made the decision tough for me. I decided to take the leap of faith and go with the bronze anyhow since blue seemed to ""kid-like"" and I'm a middle-age male gamer.When I opened the box, the top of the unit appeared to be a dark brown, almost black. It's very glossy and will get finger prints but that's not a big deal to me. When I opened up the unit, I was slightly surprised that the color of the ""face"" is actually closer to a dark coffee/mocha rather than black as it had appeared in photos online or on the box; the photo on the box as it is shown is much darker than the real unit. Some reviewers have written it is black inside; I don't know how they could think so since it is definitely NOT black; maybe they got an import model? The overall theme/feel is under-stated and sleek. Although I was never a big fan of the color ""brown"", especially when it comes to gadgets/tech, I'm beginning to get used to this after a few days of use. When compared to blue or burgundy, I think bronze appears to be much more sophisticated for a mature gamer as myself.Ok enough about the color. Just one comment on the texture of the DS. I found the back of the unit to have a harsh texture, which makes holding it not very comfortable over a long period of time.

After 2 years, our original remotes with the add-on MotionPlus attachment were getting glitchy  so we decided it was time for an upgrade. And when we saw these new Wii remotes in blue, we just couldn't resist! Truth be told, they're more turquoise than blue, but they are still a really great color. So much nicer than our old black ones. Plus, the add-on MotionPlus attachment on our old remotes were cumbersome, and often came loose. They were a real pain.These new blue ones have the MotionPlus built right in, so the remote is a bit shorter, and feels better in the hand. They even came with clear (sort of) silicone covers. We didn't know those were included, but really, it makes no difference, since we were already  looking forward to using these remotes without them. The silicone covers are neat, but really seem to erode  the remote's accuracy. But we're still glad to have them, just in case. Also, we decided to ditch the Energizer Induction charger and just opt for rechargeable AA batteries. The induction charger could be buggy at times, so we figure the rechargeable AAs will be a nice change. Plus, not using the silicone covers on the remotes makes it easier to deal with battery changes.We traded-in our old remotes and charger for Amazon gift cards, which covered most of the rechargeables.  We got 2 of these blue remotes and really love them. Syncing them to out Wii was easy; just open the small door on the Wii and push the red sync button, then push the red button on the back of the remotes.  Easy peasy.  These new remotes are Pawesome!UPDATE: Battery life seems to be much better with these new remotes.  It's been over a month, and we're still on the first set that came with the remotes, and we play almost daily, a few hours at a pop.  I think having the Wii Motion built in somehow uses less power than having the add-on dongle.  Whatever it is, love the new battery life!

As you can see, you can pick up used versions of this unit for fairly cheap (I got mine for $20).  Microsoft continues to support the players, so even with the latest xbox update, you can rest assured that this unit will still work.  In addition, many of the HD-DVD movies can be found fairly easily for pretty cheap.  Most movies can be found for less than $5, many of them even 2 or 3.  Obviously, most people won't want all of the movies that were released on HD-DVD, but you'll definitely find a few favorites.  I've saved over $170 from buying HD-DVD movies verses Blu Ray.  There are even a select few that have yet to be released on Blu Ray.As far as sound and picture quality goes, they are every bit as good as their Blu Ray counterparts.  Due to the xbox's capibilities, you don't actually get the full audio quality, but the difference is so minimal that you would only know if you had a $1,000 sound system and the two movies side by side.  The picture quality is amazing.  Most titles, you won't even need to find the DVD to compare, you'll know instantly that it's a vast improvement.  Since the drive is an extension to your xbox, most universal remotes will work with the play, pause, skip, etc. functions on the movies.If nothing else, you can consider this an extra drive for your xbox to quickly switch from playing a game to watching a movie.

Of course, I enjoy it even more when they transition over to a video game platform as well. The trouble with games that tie-in with movie releases is that there usually not great games to enjoy and only end up being mediocre. Some end up being down right awful and completely frustrating.I am always pretty lenient with video games reviews and despite the fact that some games really deserve three or three and a half stars. I'll end up giving four stars out of generosity, but Hellboy was a bit of a letdown. My only real complaint is the camera angle and control.Almost every game these days has the ability to rotate the camera 360 degree with the 2nd analog stick. This is such an important feature. However, this is not the case with Hellboy. The camera is always at one point of a view in this game and does change based on what you're doing, but it doesn't let you control it. If you are going inside a building it will zoom in a bit closer, but you can't control that zoom. It just happens when it wants to. We all know Hellboy involves the supernatural and supernatural things usually happen at night, so the majority of the game all takes place when the sun is down which results in a dark creepy atmosphere. Considering how dark every level is, everything happens at night, and the fact you can't control the camera only makes seeing Hellboy and the villains in the game a bit more complicated. Also, some of the objectives for each level are very unclear as well. I guess the only way to change this is to turn up the light setting on your TV, so you can see where Hellboy and the villains are on screen.In the first level you have to defeat the witch, who just happens to be flying above in the sky. The camera is set a  overview. Kinda like Zelda back in the Super Nintendo days, so you can't really see where she is. The instructions on screen actually tell you to throw the goblins that she throws at you, back at her. It's kinda complicated to do so when you can't see her and you can't control the camera in order to see her.That is my only real grievance with this game. Other than that, the visuals are very pretty and I found the game to not be at the point where it was so horrific that it was unplayable.

I really wanted to like this game, but it left me wanting more. I felt that although the game markets it as a game where you can control your team and how the team does, there really isn't that much control. It's more like you just choose the players, crunching the fancy numbers, but have little to no control on the outcome.* You can play as a coach during gamedays, calling hit and runs, bunts, pitching around a hitter, walking, etc., but that's as deep as it gets. Why couldn't more managerial powers be implemented? I felt that more choices could be worked into the game like : running bunt, hitting the other way, hitting a certain location with a good control hitter, pitching only to certain location to a hitter, etc. I was hoping that the mangerial aspect of the game could have been deeper.* I wasn't expecting to be able to actually control how the hitter or pitcher plays during the game, but the simulation and graphic sequences seemed questionable. Essentially, you chose among basic options like, hit, bunt, pitch, walk, pitch around. When you make your option, automatically they will animate and show you what will happen. I found this very pointless, especially if the player had no control. I suggest that that the manager should at least be able to chose where the location of the pitch, or how the hitter approaches the pitcher, not just simple hit, pitch, etc.* Real life ratings have little to do with success of player. You'll likely see more differences between someone like Tim Lincecum and Bartolo Colon, but even the best pitchers fail most of the time. With such a shallow set of choices, the game isn't letting the best pitchers or hitters, be the best players.It's unfortunate, I really wanted to like this game, but I am heavily disappointed.",2,"Number crunching, inabililty to play with players, lack of managing power leaves gamer in the dust",1320624000,"11 7, 2011"

I can't believe this title -- the PS3 version -- is still in the top 100. Oh, how I loathe this game's glitches and how I now loathe Bethesda -- in the past, my favorite developer.Not only did my Skyrim saves all become corrupted after freezing a billion times -- my PS3's HDD was destroyed by Skyrim. Literally everything on the hard drive was corrupted and the HDD needed to be replaced. The guy at Sony said he never had calls for broken HDD's until Skyrim. He said that is now the # 1 reason people call tech support.If you buy this game for the PS3, you have my word it will not work. It may take 10 hours to break. It may take as many as 35. But it will break. And there's a chance it will corrupt your PS3's HDD as well -- because when it freezes you need to physically shut the PS3 off and do a hard reset (sometimes it freezes so bad even pressing the power button doesn't turn the console off and you have to unplug it with the game frozen and disc still spinning).If you buy the game this will happen:First, it will stutter and have frame-rate issues.Second, it will start freezing up and freezing your PS3.Third, it will start moving so slow you cannot play -- literally 5 or 6 frames a second (there are tons of videos on YouTube showing this).Fourth, you'll clear your cache and try again.Fifth, if you experience what I did, the game will finally freeze and corrupt ALL saves on your PS3.Skyrim felt like a fun game during the first 10 hours while it worked. There was definite potential. It was WAY too close to Oblivion for comfort and basically felt like a remake, but Oblivion was a great game and I didn't mind the fact there was nothing new -- outside of the occasional giant or dragon -- in Skyrim. I considered buying another copy for my 360, but I cannot bring myself to pay for this game again when it has damaged my PS3 and when I already paid sixty for it on launch day.Bethesda should be ashamed, should be apologizing publicly to all PS3 owners who spent their hard earned money on this title and should be issuing a RECALL. This game is NOT fit to be sold. Bethesda knowingly sold a broken game. I will never buy another Bethesda title again. I no longer trust them. If you've played this on a PS3, you no longer trust them. If you buy this and have all these things happen, you will stop trusting them, too. What this company did wasn't just unethical -- it was devious. They hire game testers. They obviously knew it was broken. Yet they claimed, time and again, that the PS3 and 360 versions were virtually ""identical."" All that mattered to Bethesda was setting sales records. Not releasing a game that worked.Please, do yourself a favor and save your cash and your PS3. There is a 100% chance this game will eventually stop working. If anyone posts below saying they played for 300 hours without a glitch? They are lying (most likely Bethesda employees hoping to avoid a class action lawsuit). There is far more than anecdotal evidence that this game just doesn't work on the PS3.I am sick about this. It's inexcusable. Bethesda -- PLEASE do the right thing and recall this game and issue a full refund to those who want it or a credit for another game you publish for those who want something else.Here are a few tips that may help delay the game's breaking:1. Never play online. Ever. Make sure your Ethernet cable is unplugged and WiFi is disabled.2. Turn off ALL auto-saving (which is a huge headache, as it's hard to remember to save constantly on your own and you may end up finding yourself an hour or two back if you are killed in the game or if the game freezes without being saved). Turning off ALL auto-saving (it auto-saves on fast travel, on rest and on sleeping) reduces the freezing by about 50%.3. Take the game out of your PS3 and use it as a coaster for drinks as you play RELIABLE games released by COMPETENT and ETHICAL companies.If this review saves even one person from buying this broken game, I've been of help. There are a TON of great games right now for all 3 major consoles and for the PC. More than you could play in the next year. Why even flirt with buying the one that was released broken? There are too many good developers who took the time to make sure their games WORKED out of the box. Bethesda hasn't even fixed the game with a patch (the patch they did release actually broke it further). I doubt they ever will. Shame.",1,Why is anyone still buying this?

Even though Sid's name has jumped ship, this is a solid sequel to a great game. The premise is simple enough: Build a railroad, buy some trains, ship stuff from where it is to where it's needed. Get rich.From humble concepts mighty games are grown, and enriching this basic idea are things like: train quality, which forces you to choose between [cost], fast, good on slopes, or reliable; keeping demand high by supplying only small amounts versus the cost of connecting other places where demand is high; short routes with small payloads and fast turnarounds versus long routes with big payloads; buying and selling stocks to take advantage of economic trends; buying the businesses whose materials you're transporting; defending against train robbers or hiring shady characters and exploiting legal loopholes; and so on.Basically, this premise works, and supplies hours of good, addictive fun. There's a lot of replay value as well, since you can take a different approach to each game. The graphics are (still, even in 2003) pleasant and communicative, and the sound is mostly good. The scenarios are pretty challenging without (for the most part) being crushingly hard, and the three levels of victories encourages replay as you try to ""go for the gold"".The are a number of hitches, unfortunately. The manual and tutorial are really inadequate--which tends to sting given that most of the fan-supplied data on the Web is gone. The supply-and-demand process is actually somewhat opaque. (I did figure it out, but it took me a while and some research on the 'net.) Your board of directors is very gullible, not able to look ahead even a month (this makes them easy to manipulate). The stock market stuff makes it easy to lose with a thriving railroad and doesn't add much to the game that I've experienced.Further, trains really only go from point A to point B. That is, say you have cattle yard (B) that needs grain and two grain farms (A1 and A2) that supply grain, you can't set up a train to pick up grain at A1, travel to A2 to pick up more grain, and then travel to B to drop it off. When the train stops, it's completely unloaded. This is never spelled out anywhere, and certain ways of setting up a train's route suggest otherwise. But in the above situation, your train will actually unload grain at a grain farm (for no money) rather than haul it another ten miles to the cattle yard, where it's actually needed.The scale of the game is such that each train moves about 1/50th-1/100th of its actual speed. In other words, a trip that should take a week takes a year. This is probably a necessary abstraction(train-model fans will want to keep in mind that this game has NOTHING to do with their hobby) but it has the effect of exaggerating every mistake or mishap. Jesse James didn't just rob a single train, he robbed your entire route for the year.All of this detracts a bit, but it's a testament to the strength of the concept and execution that this would still be a five-star game, even with these issues. The killer--the thing that made me subtract a star--is the track-laying interface. It's really easy to lay track you didn't mean to. There's no undo. It actually costs you to remove it. The way the UI figures out the smoothest route is dubious, and there's really no decent handling for the fact that finding the smoothest track is best done at the closest zoom while finding the shortest route is best done at the furthest zoom.Coupled with some bugs that make stations seem disconnected, you can end up in a situation where you lose a game because the track-laying interface was not up to the task. And that's the only =real= sour lemon in this package. Again, though, even with this, there's still a lot of fun.It'll definitely whet your apetite for ""Railroad Tycoon 3"".",4,Promising...,1055289600,"06 11, 2003"

As we well know though graphics alone do not make a great or fun game.The initial parts are fun and quite challenging and to keep it mysterious for anyone still thinking about purchasing this I'm not going to go through them. I'm going to focus on what has made this game not fun for me and totally different from any other single player rpg I've ever played.1) The PC UI is horrible totally horrible. It truely shows this game was made for the XBOX and ported over to the PC with XBOX controls, you have to go through several functions to get to the page of the game you want like inventory or journal etc. etc. There's no ability to ""set"" hotkeys to these function like you normally would with a PC where ""I"" = Inventory or ""M"" = Map or ""C"" equals character stats or ""J"" = journal etc etc. You are forced to use what the game offers you and must memorize and learn a console system to play a PC game.2) This one takes the cake the scaled npc/mob leveling system where no matter what level you are the majority of the npc/mobs are the same level or better. If you happened to find something you think would be extremely tough at level 1 like a DRAGON guess what? It's level ONE also. Only a handful of things don't scale level with you, but, things like wolves have a counter part like timberwolves that will be your level. It's kind of funny when you level up something that was a wolf when you wake from leveling up will be a timberwolf just like that.3) Instant guard omni-presence constantly. Those of you who enjoyed playing a theif in Morrowind are in for a shock and surprise this time around. If you so much as ""touch"" an item that is not yours and belongs to another, gang bang guard(s) are going to appear and cart you off to jail (unless you pay the fine). Also as a thief ""what you see is not what you get"" You may see some glass weapons, they look like they would bring a fortune and you go through all the trouble to steal them and get away only to find out you can't use them or they are an illusion and nothing more than a cardboard copy of the real thing.4) Sadly just like npc/mobs LOOT also scales by your level in this game now. You can forget daedric armor or any decent armor/weapons for a long time, and it doesn't matter if you clear out what you think is the toughest dungeon you ever saw, if you ain't the right level yet, you are going to get trash from the drops and trash from the chests and things you have to use lockpicks to open.It almost feels like many mmorpgs where you have level restrictions on weapons and armor,the only open endedness of this game is where you explore. Everything else is predetermined from the getgo to the end. Now in Everquest I enjoyed tweaking out my level 1 character in level 50 gear and then soloing through the game as far as I could. Well, you can forget that in Oblivion, you're only going to get and find stuff and fight stuff at your level period.I'm certainly glad that the store I buy my games from has a 7 day return policy, because this one certainly went back before the 7 days were up. I know there are many out there that like this game (mostly xboxers), but, the PC version was horribly designed and the design elements of the game do not allow roleplaying or godlike characters to be created through their adventure. Sadly as you level up instead of things getting easier by your level everything gets harder because it's always equal. 45 arrows to kill one goblin is rather rediculous when you could kill the same goblin with 3 to 5 arrows at a much lower level. Stuff like that just makes this game a poor effort in the ""roleplaying"" minded aspects of it.",1,If it isn't fun it can't be good,1143676800,"03 30, 2006"

I played WOW when it first came out and then on and off for years after. I enjoyed the game immensely when it first came out right up and sometime after Lich King. What killed the enjoyment was the repetition of the same quests and zones when starting over with a different race and class.  I felt that each race and class should have their own zones or quests till a certain level like 50+. So after awhile I called it quits. Then Cataclysm arrived and I played the worgen like crazy. The worgon  in the beginning quests  where a joy, but after that I was in the night elves city Darnassus (huh?).  Why cannot the Worgon have their own city and continent? So they lost their capital city, build another one or retake it! I quit the game soon after. Then Mist of Pandaria came out and I figure why not try again? Yet it turned out to be the same thing with the Worgon now it's Panda's. Anddd.. My capital for my Pandarian is Stormwind? I want my own city to hang out in like the humans, night elves, dwarves, etc! It is nice to know you can choose sides, but so what.I love exploring and adventuring in new zones.  It is an enriching experience. So I will explore Pandaria and enjoy the game for 3 months then call it quits and go back to Guild Wars 2. So Blizzard got my cash and a sucker for 3 months.

It's not the greatest game of all time.  Most importantly, the only mark it has made on history is single day sales.That said, let's get to the bottom line about Halo 2.The Good:-Graphics-A good online multiplayer setup-Fun-Sound/Soundtrack-Dual Wielding is pretty cool.The Bad:-The Ending.-Weapons are still unbalanced, just in a different way.-Levels are still repetitive.-Some Xbox live players are, for lack of a better term, annoying as sin.-No tanks in Multiplayer (in optimatch, at least).Some Elaboration on the Bad Points:I will not discuss the ending, as to not spoil it.  It's just bad.  Really, really, really bad.The weapons are kinda irksome.  If they had left the pistol as what it was in Halo 1, it might have balanced out what they've created.  The problem is the energy sword.  Most of the maps have 1.  Short of the rocket launcher, or a well placed grenade (and that is assuming they don't hit you from behind), good luck getting off enough shots to kill someone with the sword.  Granted, if you can keep your distance, sniping is an option.  Or if you're lucky the shotgun will do it, but for the most part, it's pretty unstopable.  Which is annoying.Equally annoying is the lack of tanks in the multiplayer.  The tank balances out the warthog, ghost, and banshee.  Without it, the only balancing item is the rocket launcher.  Just seems lacking.One big complaint in Halo 1 was the levels you had to repeat backwards.  While this never happens in Halo 2, the levels themselves are internally repetitive.  For example, big room, corridor, identical big room, identical corridor, slightly different big room, slightly different corridor, etc.  There could definately be more variety.Finally, while I like xbox live and the rank/optimatch system, there are a lot of annoying people on xbox live who you'll run into.  It's unavoidable, and there's no real way to fix it, but it's there, so be ready for it.Bonus DVD: While cool, it's not essential.  Pretty interesting to watch, though, and makes a lot of sense of the news and delays we saw waiting for this game.

It looks fun and Mickey Rourke lends his voice for Dick and does a great job.  The writing...yeah, not so much.  WAY too much profanity and they are programmed so horribly, that it triggers in the dumbest of places.  You are supposed to be stealthy, but after snapping someone's neck, he stands there cursing and calling them names for about an hour.  Hello, who are you talking to?  Good thing the AI is dumb otherwise you would so break stealth.  Then other times, 20 guys are gunning for you and Mickey will say ""Oh ___"" quietly to himself.  THAT is when you should be swearing up a storm.  Not Mickey's fault, its the programmers.OVERALL:  Don't get me wrong, this game is a blast to play though, but with no one playing Multiplayer (which is so buggy and broken, its not even worth mentioning) I would so wait until this puppy goes down to $20.  Don't even waste coupons or a Christmas wish on it.  The fact that its only 2 weeks old and already $45 is proof there.  You have killer take downs, fun locales, neat achievements, and decent graphics-  but Multiplayer is broken, the AI is useless, story makes no sense, and a script that ruins the mood with gameplay over in a couple hours.  Pretty much bargain bin ready.  Good news is, you can rent it and return it fast, which is what you'll do anyway is there is no reason to visit this again - unless you want to dance to Mickey's rap at the end credits.",2,Shameful waste of talent,1260230400,"12 8, 2009"

Growing ...","[75, 81]","I couldn't help but think that, over and over, when I made the jump fromWorld of Warcraft(WoW) to Lord of the Rings Online (LotRO).  If you've never seen the original Japanese Iron Chef show, when one of the judges describes what they're eating as being ""for grown-ups,"" it usually means that it's restrained in seasoning, elegant, subtle.  A fruit ice cream that gives you more of a floral, fruity taste than a sugar rush, or an expertly-grilled cut of meat that requires you do nothing more than sit there and let it melt in your mouth.  Art, in a word, the sheer beauty of which is beyond the comprehension of children.It's sad, in a way, that it's impossible to talk about a modern Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) game without talking about WoW.  In essence, WoW more or less fails to be the very best at any one thing in order to be second best at almost everything.  It's kind of like McDonald's.  It's probably not going to ever be your favorite place to eat, but you'll probably eat there more than any other single place in your life.  It's the game that everyone can agree on.  When the topic is MMOs, it's a point of reference; the question isn't, ""how good is the game,"" it's, ""how is it, compared to WoW?""What makes LotRO really shine is not that it does things in unique ways, but that it does that with a purpose, and it does it extremely well.  Everything is about serving the story and the atmosphere.  I cannot stress that enough.  More than any of the myriad MMOs I've played to date, LotRO is an unabashed worshiper of the art of telling a good story, and telling it well.Right off the bat, as you're making your character, you are not just told to make a ""good, appropriate fantasy setting name"" for your character -- you're given a primer on who those people are and where they come from, as well as a long sample list of names, suffixes, and prefixes to work with.  Some MMOs will just pay some lip service to the idea of story-compatible names, for example, saying that certain character names are inappropriate, and then giving hypocritically mind-boggling examples.  WoW says that you shouldn't make a character named ""Technotron,"" but before very long, you'll come face-to-face with the quest mob (enemy character), Techbot.  LotRO makes character creation fun, participatory, and dare I say it, even creative.  You'll be given some food for thought as you make your avatar, with hints like, (quoting from memory) ""Elven women often have names ending in -riel, -wen..."" and so on.The realistic bent to the style of the whole game makes the fantasy elements seem almost that much more extraordinary.  As you're choosing skin, hair, and eye colors for your character, notice that the relatively limited palette for each selection is itself limited by where your character hails from.  Will you be a dark-haired son of Gondor, or a red-headed horse-lord from Rohan?  Every little thing serves the story, the atmosphere.You don't have Hit Points (HP) and Mana, you have Morale and Power.  On the surface, it sounds like a cheap distinction, but it goes deeper than that.  Your Morale (roughly equivalent to HP) can be capped by powerful evils that inspire Dread, for example.  When this happens, not only does your Morale total drop in proportion to just HOW evil the big bad you're fighting really is, but the whole screen rushes towards you and blurs for a moment, before settling back into place with an even MORE muted color palette.  It's really wonderful theater, brilliantly designed and flawlessly executed.  These little touches are everywhere in LotRO, and they add a level of polish that makes the odd bit of dodgy dialogue stand at attention and read like Tolkien.Turbine must be given credit for their very bold art style.  It's bold in a counterintuitive way; the artwork itself isn't highly stylized, in fact, it's as nearly photorealistic as it can be while still depicting a fantasy setting.  The palette is restrained, drab... real.  This relative dullness allows the game to really highlight visuals in the same simple way that reality does, if you let it.  Run up the side of a hill in LotRO, and find yourself in a field of gently swaying white flowers, and you will stop, and just look.  It's beautiful, and there is absolutely nothing remarkable about it.Water effects are similarly mesmerizing, but the little bits of the stage that peek through here and there are more obvious with the water's surface than anything else.  It handles reflectivity of objects near the surface relative to your point of view, meaning that if you are standing next to a bright copper node and you angle your point of view so that it sits before a distant pool of water, the water will appear to reflect the copper node, which is of course impossible.  It is one of only two egregious examples of broken illusion I have found yet in this game; the other was an invisible wall I ran into while swimming down a stream.I've expressed my love of random map dungeon crawls in other game reviews (likeAlien SyndromeandPhantasy Star Portable), and an MMORPG (MMO Role-Playing Game) is nothing if not a truly enormous dungeon crawl.  The problem with that is often how to get the user to understand where to go next without talking down to them.  In the latest update to the game, which was released about a week after I started playing, you can select up to five quests to track with some text on your screen.  With each of those, you can click the little ring icon next to the text and examine the quest log entry for that quest, in case you need to re-read some of the content and figure out what to do next.  As far as where to go next, this is handled with a simple arrow pointing towards the nearest quest-related area for the quest(s) you are tracking.  It's not quite talking down to the player, because the arrow points straight in that direction, and does not account for changes in terrain or elevation, what kind of hostile forces you may run into on the way, and so on.  It's a brilliantly simple solution, though I am occasionally annoyed that I haven't figured out how to select which quest I want to get directions to, as it's not always the one that's closest.Customization is not quite as deep as it is in WoW, with no user-created add-on support (to my knowledge), but what's there is certainly serviceable.  So far, I've found myself missing only the auction-house tracking add-on, as I now have to try to guess at the value of my goods to sell to other players, and can't build a long-term reference of the market on my server.  You can scale the entire user interface (UI) to your liking, and move the components around by entering a UI-editing mode with a simple key command, and then keying back out of it when you're satisfied with where things are.MMOs are often about loot, which means you need space to carry things that you pick up.  LotRO starts you off with all the bag space you will ever have, which is good and bad.  For the beginner, it's great, especially if you're familiar with WoW and the very limited bag space you start out with.  As you progress, I imagine it's quite limiting, because you can never replace your starting bags with much more generous ones.  You do have immediate access to a vault, and you can purchase additional vault space at certain levels.Combat seems, in a general sense, pretty standard; you target (or get targeted by) enemies who are near enough, you fight them or you run away, and it's basically Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots with 3D models until someone runs out of steam and drops dead.  Between just the two classes I've played with so far, there is plenty of variety in the specifics of how this happens.  Combat in modern MMOs seems in large part to be how to make each class its own minigame when the battle is joined.  All I've seen in LotRO so far convinces me beyond any doubt that I will have a very unique (and likely enjoyable) experience as I make my way through all the classes.My Minstrel uses ranged song attacks and can't take very many melee hits, but she also has strong heals, so she's reasonably survivable against single enemies of a similar level.  The Warden has a unique UI widget to handle ""gambits,"" LotRO's word for the combo-and-finisher system of play they've developed.  As your Warden progresses, more gambits become available to them, and the number of moves you can drop into the gambit widget grows.  The gambit widget fills automatically as you perform any of your basic types of attacks -- a quick thrust, a shield bash, or a battle cry, to start -- and once you've created a combination out of at least two of them, your finishing move becomes available, with enhanced effectiveness that relates to how the gambit was built.  For example, you may use your shield bash twice, and then clear the gambit with a finishing move that improves your block rating temporarily.Another given for the modern A-list MMO is crafting -- give players components, tools, etc. and allow them to make their own loot.  LotRO again goes for the unique factor by combining sets of the basic trades (which you cannot select individually) into careers made of three parts.  For example, the Armourer (British spelling abounds) is a Prospector, able to mine and smelt ore, a Metalsmith, able to fashion their ingots into chains, plates, and ultimately, armor (I mean ""armour""), and a Tailor, able to take prepared leathers and create various lighter forms of clothing, as well as the connective pieces used in the heavier gear you can fashion with your Metalsmithing.  At first, this system feels limiting, but in reality, it's no more limiting than any other MMO that imposes limits on how many tradeskills you can take, and it's another example of the atmospheric, story-centric approach that LotRO has taken to the MMO.Still one more truly singular aspect to LotRO that stands with one foot outside of the game world is the developer's relationship with the user community.  They flat-out ask the community what feature(s) they want most, and have actually changed the course of their development plans in order to satisfy those user requests.  The biggest example so far is the inclusion of player-owned housing and guild halls.  While this was always a feature intended for inclusion at SOME point in the game's future, my understanding from what I have read and heard to date is that it was the user community clamoring for it that caused Turbine to put it at the top of the feature list, and implement it more or less immediately (that is, before just about anything else).  If you really get caught up in the expertly crafted world that Turbine has made for you to play with, you can literally move in to your own house within LotRO.You can even join with your friends for some impromptu in-character jamming, as equipping any of the various instruments (even for non-Minstrels) will let you type /music and then press numbers 1-8 to play notes in an octave.  You can shift them up or down with the ctrl or shift keys, and there's even some polyphony.  It's clunky if you want to take it as an instrument, but this sort of feature is everywhere in LotRO, and the complete effect is pretty amazing.  For a few silver pieces, you can even establish familial relationships between characters.  The in-game support for roleplayers is fantastically deep.Sometimes it seems like they've gone overboard in skinning the game to make it really unique.  They've renamed just about everything but the mailbox and the Auction House, like ""Fellowships,"" instead of groups or parties, ""Kinships"" instead of Guilds, and so on, but it cannot be said that they've gone about their mission half-heartedly.If you felt like WoW was too cartoony for you, but you shuddered when you thought back to how obfuscated everything was back inEverquest I: The Anniversary Edition, give LotRO a crack.  It's not just a good-enough fantasy MMO to distract yourself between WoW expansions.  It's an elevation of MMO development to art, and it's not likely you'll find anything quite like it anywhere else.  The one exception, and you can be glad for it, is that like most major MMOs these days, there's a free downloadable 10-day trial.  If you can't wait to upgrade, like me, your 30 free days that come with the game itself are just tacked on to the 9 trial days you'll have left when you realize you just want to subscribe and dive in headfirst.",5,"A Fantasy MMO, but for Grown-Ups",1240531200,"04 24, 2009"

Since I often had to travel with work, I thought it would be good to check it out and play a few games. And... since Katamari had a PSP game along with Grand Theft Auto (there's two contrasting experiences!!!), I figured I'd make the plunge.It's a fun little system with loads of capabilities thanks to the memory sticks & battery. I haven't had that many problems with my battery life (knock on wood), but I'd always recommend to carefully check out the manual before you even think about plugging it in anywhere. Also, if you get the core system, just be on the lookout for all the materials you need. You end up paying for more than the core system - you need something to protect the screen & system itself. I picked up a bundle with a memory card, pouch & hard-case variants - one of which has a mask that screws onto the system itself. The graphics on the system are great though - better than I expected with outstanding detail. And the clarity with the movies is pretty neat too although to be honest, I'm still not into watching movies on a portable device like this or an MP3 player. But it's very cool that you can have pictures on it, even change the background of the core system, listen to music or do whatever you want, really. The pictures come out very very clear and it's easy to load them onto the system - provided you have an organizer.The negatives would have to be the total price associated with this (the accessories, etc.) and the games can be kind of expensive, IMO, for a portable device. Brand new games can run up to $50! It helps to get a management system for it to organize your media here (which is another expense). Finally, maybe it's just that I'm getting old, but my fingers can get tired playing this. Not hours of play, but aftre maybe 15-20 minutes. In some games, the control isn't so great and it isn't so responsive. And then, with the GTA games, they ended up coming out for the PS2 anyway, so I shouldn't have spent the dough on the game for the PSP and just gotten it for 15 bucks for the PS2. Finally, it might be a turn-off to some that it's got a bit of weight to it... but the size doesn't bother me with it sinc eit does so much & I just set it in my backpack anyway.I recommend it if you travel. I'm not so sure it was geared at a much younger crowd (10 and under). For me and the occasional usage, it does a good job and makes 'waiting rooms' or wherever a bit easier to tolerate. I use mine almost exclusively for the video games however with a small library and not the most traction, I'm ont so sure how long the PSP will last. If you're into music more, then I'd recommend an MP3 player like a Creative Zen or iPod instead. If you do have this, I'd recommend reading up on some of the sights and seeing all the things you can download onto the memory cards and use for your PSP - that also makes it a cool little gadget (playing some old video games on it, etc. and maybe foregoing high prices for the UMD movies).",4,I Like It,1173398400,"03 9, 2007"

It doesn't seem that the Wii Remote senses true 3d motion. What is meant by that (Check my Amazon profile because I discuss it on my website.) is when you swing it doesn't record the 3d position of your arm, instead it just records the swing as a slash motion in most games. That is so that when you swing you sword in Zelda: Twilight Princess the character (Link) just swings his sword. It is not like you are involved in a 3d sword battle.

He's a college student who enjoys playing video games and has a side interest in American battles.  He purchased CIVIL WAR: A NATION DIVIDED soon after it came out.  He played it through and when asked afterwards about it, said the game was ""just okay"".  I, too, enjoy playing video games from time to time and I am an amateur history buff, but I don't have as much time on my hands so I didn't get around playing CIVIL WAR: A NATION DIVIDED until recently (about a year after it came out).The game is a first person shooter game.  There are twelve different battles that you can fight in, six that you fight in as a Union soldier and six that you fight in as a Johnny Reb.  Only one of the battles is available to play at the start; you unlock more battles once you ""win"" a battle.  I use the term ""win"" rather lightly because there isn't much winning going on.  On each of the levels you are given specific missions to complete.  The visuals of the game are quite impressive and the sounds of gunfire, shouting, and sometimes cannons roaring give the impression of being in the heat of the action.  However, usually your character isn't.  Instead your character is set on a linear course to complete the various objectives.  Sometimes a random shooter from the sidelines will fire upon you, but other than that the only fighting you encounter are the pawn-like soldiers that stand upon the trail as you attempt to complete your objectives.  I was really disappointed by this.  I had hoped, from the description of the box (which includes pictures that turn out to be nothing but still shots from scenes you don't fight in) and advertisements about the game on the History Channel (which was a co-creator of the game) that when you play CIVIL WAR: A NATION DIVIDED you would be involved in massive battles or at least would have the opportunity to direct the movement of troops or something.  The only exploring off the beaten path that your character gets to do is find an the occasional alcove or hidden alley.From a historical perspective, CIVIL WAR: A NATION DIVIDED does have some value.  Before each battle a narrator explains why the battle came about and after each battle he explains the aftermath of each conflict. Depending on versions of the game, there are some discrepancies (for instance I know that on some versions it says that 50,000 men were killed at Gettysburg, but on the version I played it said 50,000 casualties).  I also know that there's also an issue with the visuals and the overall set up of the battle, for instance the battle of Shiloh is terrible and except for the brown and blue uniforms has no distinction in it being a Civil War battle at all.  Despite these inaccuracies, I still believe the game has some educational value because children--through teens are the ones that will probably be the people most likely to play the game and there's just enough interest here that might incite in them a desire to learn more about American history, especially the Civil War.As far as games go, CIVIL WAR: A NATION DIVIDED is just a typical first-person shooter video game.  In regards to educational games, it does have some flaws, but there just might be enough here to interest in kids about the Civil War that they'll do more research on their own.  Recommended for kids through teenagers.  If you're a Civil War buff you might also enjoy the game, but you might be disappointed in how limited the game is or upset by the flaws.",3,Nothing Spectacular,1201824000,"02 1, 2008"
11816,197659,AJUQ7HXYDQB3Z,B006W41W4Q,"Amazon Addict ""JD""","[0, 0]","As an adult gamer I have purchased so many headsets over the past couple years it's not funny. I have yet to keep one beyond 30 days until now. I have owned Tritton's, Astro's and TB's and each time I end up returning them either because they have been defective, had unacceptable interference issues, or just flat out weren't worth the exuberant price being charged for them. I would have never even considered the 400's after buying and returning the catastrophical failure that the XP500's were, but a trustworthy friend insisted the 400's were different. I must admit I am pleasantly surprised at the 400's.The sound quality is very good to me. Honestly sound quality is a very subjective matter. If you buy a GAMER headset and expect audiophile quality then you are foolish, especially at this price point. The set has decent punch, good quality mids and highs, and with some tweaking pretty good directional sound placement. As with any product there is always room for improvement but unless your expectations are too high or you are overly finicky then this headset should meet your expectations in regards to sound quality.My favorite feature is that they are really wireless. The included Bluetooth dongle means I don't have that annoying little wire running to my 360 controller. I can actually set my controller down and go grab a drink or use the head without having to take the headset off. I can also take a call if need be right in the middle of gaming since it pairs right up to my phone as well. Such a simple but awesome feature. I cannot understand why EVERY manufaturer hasn't included this yet. I have read some complaints about the chat sounding horrible with this set. I have had no such complaints with my 400's by people in game chat or those I have taken calls from. It's a non-issue for me and makes me wonder if those that had this issue even bothered trying to tweak the mic gain at all?Another great feature that I like is the built in-rechargeable battery. I know some people have penned concerns about this but I LOVE the fact that I do not have to constantly change batteries. I get a good 10-12 hours of gaming in with each charge and when it get's low I just plug in the supplied charging cable and it's all good. You can even continue to use the headset while it's charging. As for the worry about the battery eventually failing, it's a legitimate concern. It's the one reason I chose to buy these from Amazons competitor the big ""W mart."" I hated to do it but they offered a 3 year replacement plan for less than $20 so if the battery fails I'll be protected.Last but not least is the new dual frequency transmitter. All I can say is that I have had ZERO issues with interference with this model. I have two kids and a wife, all with numerous wireless devices battling for airspace in my house and I haven't had a single snap, crackle, or pop in my ear yet. The dual frequency feature WORKS as advertised.Overall this set is awesome considering all the past disasters I have purchased. Turtle Beach has made some enemies in the past and after my experiences with some of their past models I can completely understand. The XP400's have changed my tune completely. They have finally come up with a product that lives up to the hype. I still feel they could be cheaper and we all know that we pay far too high of a markup for these things but at least I don't feel buyers remorse with this set. So if your in the market for a new set of GAMER headphones then give this set a try.EDIT: 01/01/13  The headset is still going strong. One minor annoyance for my son is that he sometimes rest the controller in his lap and inadvertently turns the chat off because the button is located on the bottom of the BT pod that hooks into the controller. It hasn't been a problem for myself but if I were to change one thing about the headset it would be to relocate that button to the top of the pod in order to avoid accidentally hitting it. It still doesn't change my rating of the headset overall.",5,"A very solid headset. No wires, and no interference!!",1354233600,"11 30, 2012"
7644,98223,A3FNSUI9WMOD9D,B000ZKA0J6,Anthony Kopczyk,"[0, 1]","The original StarCraft game created in 1998 caused a tidal wave of tournaments, still happening at least up to StarCraft II's original release(And probably still continuing).  That being said, StarCraft II needed to be great for me to like it.If you haven't played StarCraft 1:1. The game is smooth, and there are hotkeys for everything. Thus the gameplay feels like it's moving quickly and smoothly.2. If you're not a fan of fast gameplay, you can turn the game speed down giving you more time to make decisions (Though multiplayer is by default on the fastest setting).3. The Story and environment of the game is the most important part. You enter the StarCraft Universe and you want more and more of it. (Hence the StarCraft Universe game some people want to make through StarCraft II)If you like StarCraft 1 here's a list of what they've improved:1. General smoothness of units (No more 2D sprites. 3D graphics causing smoother animations and higher framerates)2. Queued orders (By holding shift+click you can order a worker to go from one place to the next and build 4 different types of building in a row, greatly reducing wasted time)3. Multiple Buildings as control groups (Allowing mass rally points, etc.)- There are probably more but the list will become too long.Story:This game provides a great RTS approach to gameplay. While the campaign doesn't really teach the player how to play online against AI or human players, the campaign has a good storyline ( Continuing from StarCraft: Brood War). I can't remember if there was a prologue or not for new players. In any case the story follows the story of Jim Raynor. He's basically a Space Cowboy and it's fun to play through the missions, which are largely story based rather than game player based.Cons:1. The Pros were too large for me to really make this a decent review.2. This game is purely competitive online. If you search for StarCraft II strategies online or youtube, you'll find numerous different strategies. Some people who play online simply take pro-strategies (Strategies pros won in World class tournaments) and use them everytime. While it's an RTS game, the ability for people to just copy other strategies makes it less of a strategy and more of an &#34;identify their strategy, use this other strategy to defend it&#34;.",4,"Starcraft II - Wonderful, but too competitive",1380499200,"09 30, 2013"

You can certainly install the software from the included CD, but it is best to use the latest revision from the website.I think the key selling point of this product is flexibility: it can be switched from DirectInput mode (older games)to XInput mode (newer games) and back again.  Plus it includes the Profiler software.  This Windows software lets you customize the controls for use with games that do not have native gamepad support.  Basically, you can program the 510 to emulate keyboard and mouse tasks.I cannot think of a single downside to this controller.  It is simple to connect, comfortable, easy to use, and its programmable, if you simply have to have this or that key set up some particular way you like.The vibrations produced by the controller are typical of a ""rumble pad"".  They work fine and they aren't weak.Price-wise, you can find less expensive product, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.By the way, Logitech warranties the 510 for 2 years.

The DLC has been good so far but in the end it will be an extra $60 of stuff that should've been in it from the beginning. The only thing that's not good here is the off-balanced knifing and the characters.Multiplayer:Horrible community consisting mostly of aim bots and boosters, The weapons aren't that interesting, The maps have much less variety (not a single snow map, you have to get the DLC to get ""one"" snow map which is tiny) And most of the time, I get plauged with ""error connecting to server"" or ""switching host"" every several minutes, this cuts away from play time more than you could possibly imagine.WORST PART OF THIS GAME:The knifing. I don't know how they managed to mess it up this bad but the knifing mechanics are horrible! There is a 1/10 chance that a knife kill will actually kill. Back in Black Ops and every Modern Warfare game, the knifes actually kill when timed out. In this game, it looks like all that timing and skill went out the window and you now have to rely only on luck to get it, but there will usually be a person with a silenced shotgun killing you before you can knife them (in Black Ops 1, a well timed knife attack would kill a shotgun wielder when that close) and for some reason, you notice in every single killcam that the person getting knifed was way off screen when they died from the knife, but the person right in range of the knife never gets hurt.All in all, Treyarch did a pretty good job with this game but they need to stop counting the money for a second and fix the many glitches and errors that infest this game.Nuketown 2025 - The worst gimmick, don't expect to survive 5 seconds in this junky map.

I (thankfully) rented this game first so at least I didn't drop 60 bucks on this pile.  I'll start with the two good things about this title... well sort of.  You see even what this game does good it at the same time sucks at.Superstar mode is a nice idea but is not executed very well.  I started off as a halfback which I thought was going to be a blast.  Unfortunity I was wrong.  The shotty camera makes it almost impossible to see anyone coming at you.  You basically are just running in the direction of the play and hoping to gain some yards.  After one game of that I started over as a quarterback.  Playing as a quarterback is much much better than halfback.  You actually feel like you have some control over the game, calling audibles and moving players around feels great.  But you never have control over which plays are picked, which wouldn't be a huge problem but it seems like the computer is picking plays at random from a list of five or six plays.  I found myself changing the play with audibles a lot.  Also if you put the computer in charge of the rest of the team (defense) side of the ball your going to loss some games.  One game I scored 35 points and lost to the chargers 35-52.  LaDainian Tomlinson had 265 rushing yards and four touchdowns.  My defense couldn't stop him!  Philip Rivers threw three touchdowns on top of that.  In other words the computer AI stinks.Okay, now for the graphics.  During gameplay they are great, but after a play has ended the camera switches to closeups of a group of players (seems to be only a couple of shots).  When it does this you notice the game chugging real hard.  Its horrible slow down that is unforgivable.  This slow down is even more apparent in superstar mode.  Before each possession you are given a chance to pick your role for that drive.  This enables you to boost stats for your players or lower the opposing team stats.  This screen pops up as your coming to the line for the first play.  However, due to the slowdown many times I was able to start the play before it came up.  When it eventually caught back up it paused the game mid play.  That is laughable.The annoucer in the game does a good job giving the play by play but sounds like he is broadcasting from a tin can.  Other than that the sound is fine.So as you can tell I hate this game... don't buy it, don't rent it.  As for me I guess I will have to play ESPN Football 2005 for the rest of my life because EA doesn't know how to make a decent football game anymore... or anyother sports game for that matter.  EA should have got MLB rights and visual concepts and sega should have gotten rights to the NFL... only in a perfect world I guess.

Does Bond ever age? Does he ever get a vacation without it turning into a firefight? How many mysterious foreign chicks does he need to bang before he realizes he should retire and get married already? Seriously, no one will be as good as Sean Connery and Daniel Craig can't even pull off Bond to save his life. This dude is a serious joke, but thankfully you won't even care when you play this stupid, yet fun, game. This is one of those sleeper hits that has a retarded story and game play yet you still finish the whole thing because it's just stupid fun. Kind of like bathroom jokes; they don't do any harm, or good, yet they are still fun to say and laugh about over and over again. Quantum of Solace is like the bathroom joke of sleeper hit FPS's; you have your basic follow up and the punchline is what keeps you laughing. While you can completely forget about the retarded story about Bond and some terrorists dudes who are doing this and that I have no freaking clue and I didn't care. Daniel Craig has bit parts of his voice in the game and his model has one expression and never seems to change.While this game is seriously flawed there are a lot of good things to keep you playing (RENT IT ONLY!) The game looks really good, while not superb, it can pass off as an above average next-gen game which is a plus. Secondly, the game has super awesome guns and they all feel really powerful. While they has more acronyms than a NASA space launch you have your pistols, silenced pistols, sub machine guns, sniper rifles etc etc yada yada. While they aren't anything new they look cool, feel powerful, and sound cool and they all go BOOM! You also have grenades which are kind of retarded since you only get to carry ONE GRENADE AT A TIME!!! The game actually has a semi-useful cover system that is both great and flawed at the same time. While you can sprint around and stuff you can hit A to dash into cover (think Gears of War) and you have your typical blind firing, and all that covering crap. The flawed part is that when you get hit by a grenade you suddenly stand up, also if you aim to far to your sides Bond tends to stick his head out and you can easily get killed this way.Basically, the gun play is your typical standard FPS stuff with retarded AI to boot. You'll have swarms of guys coming after you and they just stand there and let you blow them apart. Speaking of blowing apart the game has an ""environmental damage"" system where you can shoot flashing objects to damage enemies (like we haven't seen that before!) This actually does help when you have seven guys under a wooden platform full of explosive barrels. Shooting those support beams is just oh-so-awesome. The game is full of adrenaline pumping sequences like your OMG!! button pressing cut scenes (which are actually fun) and this is where you really feel like Bond so that's always a plus on the cinematic side. Since this is a Bond game you can use stealth in a lot of the levels, but it's very shallow and not implemented well. It really feels like an old PlayStation or N64 game where you just hide behind a wall, dodge this camera's spotlight, disable that camera, and shoot that guard. The cameras don't even notice when you pop some lead into a guys head right in the camera's view. I don't know what the developers were trying to prove except for the fact that using old mechanics in 2008 doesn't work too well.A lot of times you'll not know what to do and you'll blow your cover due to trial and error (again a 10 year old thing) and you have to restart all over again (if you want to stay stealthy). So, you can sneak around, but it feels really old and doesn't really work out too well. Of course you have to have some Bond moves to perform and this is done by pressing the L stick and pushing the on screen button and watching a 2-3 hit instant kill! While this is cool the animations get repetitive, when the camera pulls back into first person mode you get disoriented since sometimes the game will flip you around, and it's too easy to do. It's cool sneaking up behind a guy and pulling off a Bond move, but after about twenty times you'll get sick of it. Another thing I didn't like is there were no driving sequences. What's a Bond game with no DRIVING!!?!?! There is, however, a cool train sequence that is pretty cool with you decoupling cars, jumping from decoupled cars, and just all that cool Bond stuff. While that's the basic game play you can see there is a lot missing that should have been in here.With the mechanics feeling about 10 years old this really drags the experience down and after awhile the game feels more like a chore that you're forced to play. Thankfully, the game isn't very long at all since you can beat it in about 6-7 hours. The multiplayer is OK, but nothing super special just your standard FPS online action and you won't be coming back for this often since the mechanics are somewhat flawed. I really loved this game though since there was a lot of explosions, shooting, sneaking, Bond moves, and cool locales.

Not only does Bethesda employEpic FAIL.the very same, glitch-prone ""Gamebryo"" engine, but they've already had to ""patch"" the darned thing, and it hasn't been out for 60 days yet! Talk about CRAPPY design and quality controls! ""EPIC FAIL"", as my Kids would say.Now before all of you die-hard Elder Scroll devotees jump on me I'll just save your breath. I've been gaming for longer than most of you have been alive.

So, you wanna vent your spleen on someone? Either talk to those lack-luster production thieves at Bethesda...like Pete Hines, or better still; go look in the mirror, since its thanks to suckers like you that they keep getting away with making a small fortune spitting out crapola like this!European disdain of Americans as ""suckers"" is well justified when we allow our Manufacturers to get away continually producing such low-quality, but high glitz products as these, and paying gobs of money for the privilege. Had this game not been a gift, I would have already returned it as defective. And frankly, I think its high time we, the Consumer start demanding the same accountability of our game manufacturers as we do of our automotive makers; i.e.- If they issue a defective product - Force them either recall it, fix it, or pay the Buyer a full refund! To date, NO ""patches"" Bethesda has issued have fully resolved the problems in their previous games, such as Morrowind and Oblivion. and from what we can tell, they have no intention of fixing those games, but have in fact ""Moved on past that..."". Nice, huh? don't fix your crappy product, just push out another one!The bugs are many, but here are just a few more notorious ones encountered in less than 100 hrs. of game time:- Screen freeze and total system lock-up requiring restart of the console. This happens often when transitioning through doors, etc.- Items and characters sometimes disappear completely for no apparent reason leaving quests unresolved.- While everyone ""Ooohs and Ahhhs"" about the graphics, there are whole sections of scenery, walls, etc which simply disappear and show-up blank.- If you've played the previous Elder Scrolls, you will immediately note that you can do far less with your characters in Skyrim than before. Example: In Oblivion you could equip at least 2 rings with various enchantments to help your character - Now it's only 1. Previously you could craft a ""Chameleon Suit"" which would give you 100+ undetectability; no more, gone, nada... ""Go Fish"".- While not a ""glitch"", it is still annoying to some that while prices are generally high on everything in game, the bounties, rewards, and loot are relatively poor considering what you must sometimes go through to get it.Over-all I think Bethesda has ""majored in the minors"" here while ignoring the 800 lb. ""Gorilla in the room""; i.e. - Their game engine SUCKS! They need to revamp it, and until they have worked ALL of the bugs out of it, STOP producing these irritatingly buggy games! Stop worry about incorporating and ""exploring"" clever lil' social ""paradigm shifts"" in player scripting, like homosexual marriage (yuk!)...which I'm sure pleased a number of deviants to the tune of more $$$, and stick to getting the basics worked out! BTW - Anyone who knows zip about true Nordic history knows that sodomy was a capital offense. So much for in-game realism and immersion... better to go ""immerse"" your head in a toilet rather than incorporate those ideas.Anyway, ""caveat emptor"" ""Let the Buyer beware"". This game is glitchy, annoyingly so, and it's doubtful given their past history that Bethesda will ever truly fix it to your satisfaction.",2,Disappointing Rush-Job,1325116800,"12 29, 2011"

4061,168574,A2UO60B9P7MAK3,B00488PZ2S,D. A. Theisen,"[3, 5]","Though I was not really a fan of the original Shift (though it offered some fun), I walked into Shift 2 thinking ""well, they could take the first and just make some changes that the community was very vocal about, it'll be better than the first, and we'll have another serious racing sim franchise!"" ...Setting the bar as low as ""some changes"" was apparently far too much. The only thing more disappointing than the experience of this EA racing offering is that it's clear that a great deal of time and effort was spent developing it to be this miserable.Follow-up: After a good deal more play (I like to finish 'career' modes in all games, just for completion purposes), most problems below became progressively worse at the endgame stuff as the cars got faster and the AI more aggressive.Well, what did I get myself into? One aspect I've respected is that the Shift series is a Racing sim, not a driving sim. It's about the whole driving experience and not just moving the car on the track, and there are important differences between the two. In this respect, I suppose Shift 2 does what it's billed to be... ""the driver's battle"" (as stated on the case) with significant ""immersion"". Problem is, it's an implementation in all the wrong ways. In trying to make the cars sound more ""race-like"", extremely overdone and obviously faked sound effects of gears and suspension clanking around are thrown in. Engines sound reasonable, but kind of generalized per type, like V8s, V12s, Turbo L4s, etc all sound familiar regardless of car and could vary on an exhaust tweak at best. I've run into various audio bugs, as well... when there are many cars within range, the sound simply cuts out, with the game apparently too confused on how to mix all the samples.To make the player further feel as though he/she were driving in a racing situation, bugs splatter and splashes of water come to the front of the car, but this happens even away from in-car view, and is not something that can be turned off. When making contact with something, the screen goes to gray and becomes blurry to ""simulate"" a driver's reaction to an incident, but it makes seeing ahead impossible, takes 5+ seconds to go away, and is another something that cannot be turned off.Such details are impossible not to notice, and eventually become humorous in the ironic ""wow, won't this go away yet?"" sort of way.Exceptionally annoying is Shift 2's attempt at a Career Mode, and is yet another feature implemented for all the wrong reasons in all the wrong ways. In this case, a Formula D champion gives you orders/instructions/tips no matter what mode or event you're participating in. Okay, so I'm sure he can help me with drifting events, but how is he offering me track tips when I take a GT1 car around the timeless Monza or Spa? Though there are rivals (bosses) at points during the career mode, why is he my rival in the ""Muscle"" category events? How is he giving me tips while I'm racing against him?Again, the sort of thing that becomes funny over time because of its sheer stupidity.Speaking of GT1 cars, the game does sport an official FIA license for the series, which one would think could add some credibility. Alas, no, as the races in the 'official series' lack such basics as pitstops and run about 10-20% the length of a true feature race. ""Endurance"" in Shift 2 means 20 laps, and despite the fact that the folks at EA figure you'd appreciate a GT1 license, they fail to connect the dots to realize that players might want the experience, too. Personally, as someone who enjoys the 2-4+ hour events offered in other games, I'm flat-out insulted that the developers assume I have a maximum attention span of about 30 minutes for a race. Then again, without the ability to repair damage or need to change tires, I guess dragging it on more would be pointless. The signature championships are generally 5-10 race series of measly 3 lap races.Soundtrack? Catchy, but in a bad way. Graphics? Nothing special sticks out and it's nothing compared to banner games from Sony, Microsoft or Codemasters. The advertised ""helmet cam""? Causes nausea and makes it very hard to drive since the game will change your viewing direction on its own. AI? The old Burnout games didn't have opponents this aggressive, but at least those featured a heavy catchup assist. Yup. One mistake in a 2-4 lap race? Forget it. Car handling and tuning? Every car feels like an SUV behind the wheel... one gets the sensation of floating while driving, yet in every turn the car will bog down with understeer. Difficulty? Unforgiving, even on the lowest setting. Damage? Exaggerated. ""Simulator"" aspect? It has an awesome telemetry mode to view you motion and grip while driving, so it's a shame that the driving itself is so fake. In-game ads? Shameful, though not as bad as the original Shift.There ARE things on the positive side of note, I'll admit. It's just unfortunate that they've been wasted in this game and not somewhere else where they might actually be appreciated. The profile save system online (Autolog) stealthily records just about everything you do, compare with friends, and it will even notify you when you've been upped on an event.Exceptionally sad as a 'positive' for me is the absolutely incredible track selection which I'd argue isn't matched by anything else currently on the market. Really, it's an amazing list of locales and something other games should be envious of. The car selection is perfectly acceptable and varied, and it can be fun to just think ""what if...?"" and drive something at a track you like. It's a huge collection of real-world tracks from the GT3, GT1, DTM, BTCC and F1 championships + even more.Racing fans should do themselves a favor and avoid this tedious ""simulation"" game that functions as a sandbox arcade racer at best... not without a good list of reasons to play. In the future, this may turn into a passable budget title for people just looking to flog some quick cars around famous global locales. At a $40-60 price tag?

10652,159227,A2HVNYP6KE695O,B003O6HDHA,"Joman1000 ""Joman""","[150, 158]","Let me start by saying that I am a die-hard Silent Hill fan.  I played the first game when it was released in 1999, which made me about 12 years old (my parents obviously made a very ""wise"" purchasing decision at the time) and bought every subsequent game (aside from the Japanese play novel and on-rails arcade game) on the dates of their release.  Despite that the game disturbed me beyond words and gave me recurrent nightmares, I felt compelled to keep coming back for more just because it was such an inexplicable, bizarre, unique, emotional, ""otherworldly"" experience.  I was never the type to lose sleep over movies and games about zombies, diseases or war/general violence; Silent Hill transcended those things to me because it was like it was pulled directly from my deepest, darkness nightmares and fears of evil, eternal damnation, etc.  Silent Hill 1, 2 and 3 aren't ""video games"" so much as they are, in my opinion, works of absolute genius, developed by a handful of Japanese game designers that were clearly very well versed in classic horror films, novels and religious lore.  They have set an incredibly high standard for anyone to attempt to live up to.With that said, Silent Hill Downpour is certainly a valiant effort, not to be mistaken as the absolute failure that a couple of other reviews around the internet have described it as.  It is a massive improvement from SH: Homecoming (which pretty much played out like someone watched the movie, played the first game for ten minutes and said, ""OK, I get it."") but alas, still doesn't hold a candle to the first three games in terms of their artistry, imagination, soundtrack and the way they just... well, stuck with you, making you lose sleep and contemplate the overwhelming weirdness you had just witnessed.First of all, The enemies in this game are somewhat unoriginal.  It's ironic that the band Korn did the song for the trailer because one of the first enemies you encounter almost looks like a zombie version of one of the Korn band members; complete with black, parted bangs that hang over its face.  The designers did a nice job of making the light reflect off of their bodies which appear to have a charred texture, reminiscent of Silent Hill 2's ""prisoner"" demons, which looked as if they were encased in their own burnt flesh.  But despite this one cool visual effect, these creatures (referred to as, ""screamers"") aren't that disturbing.  One of the other enemies you encounter are these tall, lanky beings that have the ability to crawl around on the ceiling and attack you from above... sounds scary, right?  Not really.  They're kind of goofy looking and their movements are a little bit too exaggerated.  And the last type I'll mention (brace yourselves)... sex dolls with blacked out eyes whose ghosts are invisible and fight you.  I mean, really?  Luckily their existence in the environments makes for a much more frightening experience than the enemies do by themselves.The other major downfall to this game is the overall lack of polish on the final product.  Before buying this game I told myself the rumors of camera jitter, image chopping and framerate dips weren't going to effect my playing experience because I know there is supposed to be so much more to this series than the occasional programming flaw.  Despite telling myself that, trust me, they do cut into the gameplay experience.  None of the visual faults lie in the graphics themselves; only in the camera, the visual rendering and the occasional pop-up textures.  While it is easy to overlook, it does make the game feel like less of a complete product than previous games.  Hopefully the developers will take the hint and release a patch that fixes these issues because they take what would be in my mind a 4-star game and turn it into a 3-star one.The environments are very detailed and it's clear the developers put a lot of time and effort into making sure everything looked truly abandoned, like it was inhabited at some point and the inhabitants just mysteriously disappeared one day.  The crumbling walls, dusty interiors, strewn garbage and great lighting effects combine to create a chilling world that will feel like home to any hardcore Silent Hill fan.  This is one of the game's biggest selling points.  If it didn't feel like Silent Hill, it wouldn't be worth playing and it really does feel like Silent Hill.  The dramatically improved graphics from previous entries in the series only adds to the believability.  The only problem I have with the environments is that there are too many sections where you have a lot of visibility.  That might sound strange to newcomers of the series but to old school fans like myself, the extremely limited visibility actually pulled the player deeper into the game, making them wonder what was going to be around every turn and just what unimaginable horrors lay just out of view.  Luckily there are sections where the game is extremely dark and the only light you have is the light of your flashlight.  These are the classic Silent Hill moments and by far the creepiest sections (look forward to the mines and certain cramped interiors, both on and off the beaten path).Here is where my heart breaks a little bit.  The ""otherworld"" sequences are a mix of engaging and totally cliche'.  The ""wall-peeling"" mechanic introduced in the movie is something I've really grown tired of seeing.  Not every transition has to come with the walls peeling away.  Some of the transitions into the nightmare realm in Silent Hill 1, 2 and 3 didn't even involve sirens or anything; sometimes they involved going through some strange door, taking a ride on an elevator decorated with flesh or getting consumed by black veins and passing out.  It's not just some stupid alternate dimension, it's a re-imaging of the current dimension incorporated with the main character's deepest and darkest fears.  I'm so sick of it playing out like some silly trip to another planet or something.  There are some cool things in the nightmare realm in this game, such as bodies rattling around in cages but you don't really get to enjoy them to their full extent when you're running from an all-consuming ball of light, which is not that scary.  It's kind of scary when it catches you because Murphy (the main character) starts to peel away kind of like the walls and emits an ear-piercing scream but other than that the concept of the floating black hole is not really that frightening.  I miss the days of stark black, chain link, blood, rust, walls that move and breathe like they're alive, strange pictures and statues posing in mind-boggling ways... these are the things that embody the nightmare universe, not some stupid vortex chasing you along catwalks.Lastly, to be positive, I'm really happy they brought back the explorational elements of the game.  There are so many different side quests to be experienced (many of them more eerie than the linear storyline itself) all with their own psychological rewards.  The puzzles are the perfect degree of hard without being so hard that you want to pull your hair out and stop playing the game.  The characters are particularly interesting and really remind me of the kind of 'people' one would encounter in a Silent Hill game including the main character, and the voice acting and motion capture are some of the best the series has ever seen.To summarize, if you are a Silent Hill fanatic like me, there are fruits to be experienced in this game that will perhaps tide you over until a game comes out that is everything we could ever hope for (if that ever happens) but don't expect it to blow you away like the first three did.  If you've never played a Silent Hill game, there is enough here for you to find enjoyable and unique, particularly if you're a fan of survival horror.  There are cracks in the surface of this game and it's clear it isn't the work of 'Team Silent' but it is a worthy addition to the collection of anyone who takes an interest in the macabre and the generally bizarre.  But it won't keep you up telling yourself it's the scariest thing you've ever seen. -Joman",3,"Highly underrated, still lacking in certain areas",1331683200,"03 14, 2012"

These games get you immersed into the Warhammer 40,000 Universe. I like that with these two installments more and more lore is getting put into the game making it much more realistic yet still science ficition. Unlike the other games your not allowed to build bases which for me is a dissapointment. I understand that it makes sense to have a mobile army for some of the factions like Space Marines but I didnt like that they focused less on building minature civilization and base defenses. I like the old version (Dawn of War, Dawn of War: Winter Assualt Dawn of War: Dark Crusade, ) of the games because its nice seeing the base explode and have the enemy suffer. In this version of the game your forced to either take cover in the enviroment or hide next to your HQ building which offers only 2 turrets. For that reason it makes defending your HQ nearly impossible in mid game and its annoying becausing your chances of making a counterstrike is limited. This game has a high replay value meaning that every battle feels different and your allowed to chose different paths or weapons.Campaign(No Spoilers):The first campaign Dawn of War II consists of you the Space Marines battling against several factions. There is limited decision you have to make in battle aside from knowing to take cover and using your special abilities. It is repetitive at times and the objectives are usually the same thing over and over. While the second campaign of Dawn War II: Chaos Rising offered a variety of missions and it picks up right after you've left off on the previous campaign (it includes your weapons, levels, and characters). The campaign is a couple missions shorter than the previous one but the in game action is more exciting. My main complaint was that some of the levels were downright frustating because they were confusing. You did not know where to go or if you were going to the right the direction. In one of the missions it could actually take around 1 hour just to defeat a single character. In addition sometimes the enemy units randomly spawned across the map wether their bases were destroyed or not.Graphics:I don't think graphics get any better for a Real Time Strategy game than what the graphics this game has. The soldiers have a reflection on the water, Bullets hit their targets or kick up dirt when they hit the ground. When the soldiers fight they are actually striking blows on the enemy soldiers instead of hitting thin air or beside them. There is lots of gore in this game if your into that when there is napalm the units are charred and while if the unit is hit with a shell the body is shredded. The graphics are great but at the same time this game much more demanding for computer requirements and even higher computer requirements online. The game will automatically drop a player online if there computer lags for longer than a minute. This a good thing because it stops your game from freezing if their lagging and its a bad thing because if your ally gets dropped when your in a middle of a massive battle it defeats the point of playing the game. I think that this game should of least given the players the option of dropping the person who is lagging instead of automatically dropping them.Multiplayer/ Difficulty:The difficulty of this game on a scale of 1 to 10 is 7 in my opinon for the simple reasons that it has a steep learning curve. If you do not select the right upgrades you will find yourself having a difficult time both offline and online. On online the battles are short and in a single engagement you could find that you've already lost the battle. Once an enemy has taken the advantage wether it be a resource or cover there is almost no chance of victory unless you take it back within a minute. I also find it really frustating that unlike the previous games that you cannot win if your lacking in a single unit combination.  Even though in this game you do not have bases it does not make the strategy anymore easier for me. I usually relied on my base defenses and artillery to do the job. Now your forced into an offensive game where you just grab as many command points and kill as many of the enemy as you can.",3,New is not always good,1280448000,"07 30, 2010"

I loved Oblivion so much in fact that I went back and purchased TES III: Morrowind and played that game seemingly endlessly. Suffice to say that the announcement of TES V: Skyrim was set to be one of my most anticipated gaming experiences of 2011.After logging approximately 100 hours into Skyrim (I have not finished the main storyline) I feel I'm ready to write a review. As the title implies, Skyrim is not perfect, far from it in fact. While there is a lot to like with this latest offering from Bethesda Softworks there is also a lot to dislike.I'll also state right off the bat that I'm playing this game on the PS3, as it's my console of choice, despite the fact of Bethesda's attitude toward the PS3 seems to be that of a distant afterthought. There are many well known issues with the PS3 version that specifically impact things like the frame-rate. Then there are issues that seem to plague all versions ranging from large bugs like backward flying, unkillable dragons to simple glitches like items becoming stuck in the players inventory. I'm sad to say that I've been exposed to all of these. It's widely known that Bethesda is notorious for releasing games in varying states of finish and Skyrim is no exception. I've heard from fellow gamers that Bethesda seems to treat its customer base as a free pool of beta testers and after seeing the state that Skyrim, Fallout 3, and Fallout 3: New Vegas were released in I'm inclined to agree.Back to the meat of the game, Skyrim takes place about 200 years after the events of Oblivion and as the title implies unfolds in the northernmost realm of Tamriel known as Skyrim. The player begins as a prisoner of the Imperial Forces riding on a cart with other prisoners on their way to execution. Events unfold and a dragon attacks the Keep at Helgen where you were set to be executed. From there on your immediately thrust into the vast world of Skyrim where a war is being fought between Nords siding with Imperial Forces and those siding with a rebel leader known as Ulfric Stormcloak. The story in Skyrim can be as much or as little as you make of it in similar fashion to past Elder Scrolls titles. For example you can simply choose to skip lengthy dialogue scenes or choose not to read many of the vast volumes of books scattered across the landscape in towns, villages, castles, dungeons and keeps. I've heard many complaints from JRPG fans that The Elder Scrolls games are lacking in substance but really there's plenty of back-story, it's just left up to the player to choose to experience it or not.Graphics are nice but not spectacular in the same way as cutting-edge PS3 games are like Uncharted. For certain this is a step up from Oblivion's graphics. Facial expressions of the games many NPCs have been upgraded and are immediately noticeable. The landscapes are breathtaking in many spots and the terrain in Skyrim is a vast mountainous expanse. There are snowy, fog covered peaks, with ragging blizzards to traverse to dense coniferous forests. Raging rivers carve through the environment from the mountainous terrain down to the forested hillsides and lowlands. The variety to the landscape of Skyrim is truly a marvel to behold! The lighting engine has received a major upgrade as well and dungeons feature a variety of lighting techniques, shadows and gradients of colors. The variety afforded by the lighting system is impressive. Exploring outside at night can range from a pitch-black experience on a cloudy night to a magical romp across the land as the Northern Lights are beautifully recreated in Skyrim. A vast, imposing moon can be masked behind fog and craggy peaks. Again, the entire world is impressively rendered. The menu system has also received a graphical facelift and unfortunately seems to be for the worse. While the new categories nicely organize the thousands of items you'll pick up throughout your quest in Skyrim the menu looks sparse and in sharp contrast to the setting of the title. You can no longer view your characters equipped armors and weapons right in the menu which is sorely missed. Thankfully Bethesda spent some time working on the 3rd person camera which seemed to be almost unusable in past TES games. This remains the only way to view your character and equipped items.The sound department has received equal attention in my book. The musical score changes to reflect your current surroundings from a peaceful melody as you meander through a forest meadow to an ominous track as you sneak about a bandit's dingy hovel. Once in combat the music really picks up and does a great job ratcheting up the tension. Voiceovers are thankfully much more varied than those found in Oblivion though of course you'll soon become accustomed to a familiar set of voices.The character creation system has been streamlined although you do lose some of the options past TES games imparted. Similarly the upgrade system has been simplified and is much more approachable to newer players than past games. There are dozens and dozens of perks to unlock via the leveling system. One level imparts one skill point to assign to an astrological sign correlating to a particular skill. Some perks require a certain level to be achieved before a it can be unlocked and learned. Leveling is accomplished in a similar way to past TES games - mainly by using the various skills at your disposal. The variety to your character customization is only limited by your ambition, planning, and of course the level cap which is set at 70.As far as an overall rating I hate to give Skyrim less than it deserves although in its state on the PS3 it's difficult to rate the title highly. Would I recommend the PS3 version of Skyrim to a friend? Probably only if that's their only means of playing the game. If you have a PC that can run this game then definitely go that route. For me playing through on the PS3 version of the game I have a love, hate relationship with this title. There's a lot to like but that can be quickly dissolved by the frustrating mess this game can become when the frame rate starts dropping.UPDATE: Bethesda released update v1.4 in early February for consoles and for the PS3 it was an immediate improvement to the framerate issue that plagued the title. The change was literally night and day; I went from experiencing almost constant lag to a smooth playing experience once again.All in all I logged in around 200 hours into Skyrim and the last 100 hours or so post update v1.4. There were some sporadic occasions where the framerate still hiccuped but nothing remotely comparable to the problems I was experiencing before. It's a shame that Bethesda continues to treat PS3 gamers with such low regard. Had they released Skyrim without the framerate issue the game would've certainly garnered better press and more importantly trust between developer/publisher and consumer.",3,"A Love, Hate Relationship - Skryim is a Mixed Bag",1325808000,"01 6, 2012"
5109,156255,A3TI2FTZN3YJV2,B003O6CBIG,magis123,"[8, 14]","Wow, I cannot believe I got duped into buying this game.  I watched all the preview videos, bought into the hype that Activision & Infinity Ward spun around this game; only to find out that when you got it, it looks NOTHING like any of the videos they have shown.  I have purchased the Hardened Edition for the PS4 (and I have a pre-launch PS4 to play it on), the regular version for the PS3 and the regular version for the PC; so I have quite a breadth of experience here playing the game already.Let's get down to it, the game is just bad.  It really is more of a beta than a final release product and if you contact Infinity Ward or Activision customer support about it, the representatives there will tell you that very thing.  I have heard from several different levels of support today [after spending nearly 6 hours on the phone with support] that we just have to 'bear with them, the product needs just a little tweaking and it will be perfect'.  Seriously?!  The game which you released needs tweaking?!  The connection is completely unstable [dedicated servers?  I do not think so] on the multiplayer facet that you get logged out after only a couple games, that or it locks up your system.HACKERS -- that is right on day one of the release of this game it was already hacked.  Infinity Ward knew about this two months ago because there was a Chinese site that had posted the entire code for the game for people to start hacking, but they did nothing about it.  And the in game reporting system?  It is the biggest joke there is.  All the multiplayer leaderboards show ridiculous statistics that are clearly hacking, but is anything being done about it?  No.  I have followed specifically 10 people that I reported for hacking on day 1 of release; nothing has been done to them or their account and they just continue to hack away.  Oh and the hackers are on ALL platforms, PS4 included (I am assuming XBONE but I do not know anyone with a pre-launch XBONE).NETWORK USAGE - When playing online, normal games use about 10-20 KB/sec of data usage (this is what I average playing either MW3 or BO2 or even currently BF4) ... on average I am seeing ranges from 65-100 KB/sec of usage with this game.  So 5x the normal usage with this game.  What could that mean?  Number one it seriously heats up your system, and number two if you have bandwidth caps with your provider, it will be 5x more likely for you to hit them and get overage charges.HARDWARE USAGE - (THIS RELATES TO THE PS3 VERSION ONLY, I DO NOT HAVE SENSORS ON MY PS4) - CPU Usage on the PS3 consistently spikes to 100% and stays there for extended times, longest time at 100% was for a full 35 minutes.  Just imagine that amount of usage.  After playing Ghosts for ~25+ minutes, the CPU core temperatures on the PS3 go to 90*C (194*F) on average, I have seen temp spikes in the excess of 115*C (239*F)  RAM usage, when playing the game there is never less than 100% of the PS3 RAM being used.  How this affects the game or system is that if god forbid someone sends you a message or game invite, you run the risk of disconnecting from the PSN servers because simply put the system cannot handle it.  Also if you do not clean out your Inbox and Sent Box which are stored in the temporary RAM on your PS3, you also run the risk of the game locking up.  The Blu-ray drive runs almost constantly.  I have never had a game that ran the Blu-ray drive this much.  Blu-ray drive temperatures are running between 65*C (149*F) and 85*C (185*F).  This will cause premature failure of the drive, which could be a very brilliant product strategy if that is what Sony wants (product failure means you would probably go out and buy a new unit).--------------------------------------------So what was my resolution after speaking with support today for 6 hours?  They told me to contact Amazon and that because of the level of complaints that have been issued about this game, Amazon would give me a full refund of the game.  That's right instead of making the game right or making good on the issues, they told me to go back to the retailer who sold it to get a refund for their faulty game.  Amazing.  Oh and my Hardened Edition only had the game and the steelbook inside of it, EVERYTHING ELSE was missing.  Their response to that, ""Well we are sorry about that, again contact Amazon for a full refund.""  MIND BLOWN.",1,Copying My Review From The Hardened Edition,1384214400,"11 12, 2013"

I was apprehensive to get the basic but wanted to make sure we had one before Christmas. Also after giving it some extensive thought and a lot of research I am happy with the purchase over the deluxe.  I like the white better and will eventually get an external hard drive for it.  Honestly 32gb is not that much more memory and we do not download much from online stores anyways.  Nintendoland we will try to pick up for cheap as the price falls and people turn them in if ever.  But as far as the system itself goes.  It has been great! My oldest son loves that he can watch Netflix or play the new Mario on the gamepad while other members of the family watch tv.  My favorite part about the Wii U is that the whole family can get together on the couch and play together.  We are always looking for ways to get family together and have grown tired of the very individual based games consoles and games that are the norm now.  It brings back memory's as a child when I would be at a friends house or vice versa and we would play for hours.  All in all it has been a lot of fun and we will be interested to see the direction the Wii u takes especially as more updates come.  By the way the first update is tremendously long.  If you are waiting to give it as a gift I would highly recommend doing the giftee a favor and updating it for them.  Yes it does take that long that I am recommending opening it for them to update it and then repackage it.  That is why I dropped the star off other than that it has already been a lot of fun and we are excited to see what Nintendo Wii U games will be coming.  Mario Kart U I hope is coming soon.

There is a cutscene where Dexter is talking to Kimmy and she yells at him to GET HER OUT OF HERE! That scene is omited from gameplay. I also noticed there were a few other scenes like that missing from the game. You will also notice the JUMP when this scenes are cut out..YES this looks and plays 100% like the arcade MINUS the missing scenes which make no sense why they were removed.I do have an email in to the company regarding this problem but they have been less than helpful at this point as if they have no clue what I am talking about.So over all I would give this a 4 out of 5 because of this issue.

Don't even bother contacting EA support because this is what they said ""Please note: As a general policy, EA does not offer refunds on any products downloaded through Origin.""

No power-ups or anything of that sort, which I kinda like... you start out in one zone, and after every few waves a new area opens up. The biggest shock about this for me was that it's only single player, the draw for COD zombies is getting your friends together to play. I also found a spot where I could hide where zombies couldn't touch me, I made it to wave 33 like this, and only died because I decided I didn't feel like playing anymore. I pretty much could have went on forever like this...So this mode is flawed, and I doubt it will ever get patched.Overall the game is just incomplete, and a letdown.

I doubt you'll even find use for it, it's just too freaking fast!!Some reviewers have complained about the battery life, but mine so far holds its charge for a long time and I haven't had any major issues with the performance. I have big hands and I must say, this mouse is very comfortable, I get not cramps on my hand or any type of discomfort. The design is a work of art, it looks amazing on my desktop and the charging cradle also looks good, so you won't have some ugly charging station sitting atop your desktop.There are some issues with this mouse you should know though. I do not mind them, but you might, and here they are:The dpi changing buttons are too close to the left click button, so you have to be very careful, specially during FPS gaming, when sniping, if you try to lower the dpi for more stability, you might accidentally hit the fire button and give away your position.Second, you can use the mouse wired or wireless, but this can be a tricky thing to do; plugging the freaking USB cable to the mouse can be a pain and it's even more difficult to take off, but with practice it becomes easier. Can be an issue for hard core gamers.Final words....If you already have, lets say, a Logitech G5 mouse, like I do, you may want to think about it before buying the Mamba, reason being, it's over 100 bucks!! and who knows how/when/where you'll even use the 5600dpi. But if you don't mind spending the cash and want a fast, and I mean FAST, good looking, very responsive wireless/wired mouse, that performs outstandingly, you won't regret buying the Mamba. Also, it is such a cool mouse that besides its amazing speed and performance, it gives you high bragging rights.UPDATED REVIEW: I WISH I HAD KNOWN WHAT I KNOW NOW ABOUT RAZER'S MAMB...It's been almost a year since I bought this mouse, what a huge mistake that was. I bought it right before Windows 7 came out. Razer DID NOT have any drivers/firmware updates for this mouse for Windows 7, none whatsoever. Once the software updates were out, this was a couple of months later, my mouse bricked during a firmware update, so I had to send it to Razer, who by the way, has the WORST customer service I have ever dealt with. They took 3.5 weeks!! 3.5!! to get my mouse back to me. Once I got it, it was working, but still with old drivers/firmware. What a joke razer is. After a few months, around March, I started having problems with the battery life, it would drain rather quick and so ever since, until this day, my Mamba is now wired all the time.Now the mouse does what it wants. Sometimes the tracking system fails. The cursor freezes or lags terribly. I even bought a razer mouse pad to make sure I had everything needed to have the best performance out of this mouse. What a huge failure.My honest advice...STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOUSE, SAVE YOUR MONEY. Buy a Logitech G5 instead, I've had one for 4 years!!! I recently dumped my Mamba for good, dusted off my old G5 and could not be happier.",1,UPDATED REVIEW....SAVE YOUR MONEY!!,1254614400,"10 4, 2009"

I have to say that I have mixed feelings on the new Black Ops.  I usually run through the single player campaign first before going to multiplayer, but was unable to get through it this time around. The graphics are very cartoony and made it really difficult to get into a war game when you are shooting characters that appear as though they came out of a Disney movie.  Switching to multiplayer at first was a drag as most of the new maps seemed to encourage camping and sniping with lots of corners and large empty run corridors.  Luckily my version came with the nuketown map, and since switching over to 24/7 nuketown, I've been having a blast and have been appreciating the game a little more. Weapons, kill streaks, perks, are for the most part the same with some ""future"" enhancements.  I would not say these enhancements make it more desirable to play, but adds a slight cool factor to watch.Multiplayer server:  There appears to be a lot of lag and disconnects which really surprised me since that was a big issue when the first black ops came out.  So if you have not bought this game yet, and you are able to wait.  Highly recommend waiting till mid-December.  Usually there is a temporary $20 price drop around that time to encourage xmas sales.  Hopefully they will fix the server issues by that time as well.  Another add - you can get probation if you constantly end a game before the match ends.  Which the first time I saw the probation info, I was ticked off as I was constantly being disconnected from the game due to server issues.So what do I like?  I love the combat training with the bots.  My kids love to play COD with me, but they get creamed when playing other online players.  Setting up bots, and we can play for hours just having fun without them getting frustrated with constant respawn timers.  I do like several of the kill streaks, especially the dogs (welcome back killer puppies) and the stealth helicopter.

Online multiplayer gaming can frequently become unplayable unless you just stick to 1v1 on smallish maps.The game has Vista problems (or Vista has problems with this game).  It tends to crash on Vista during big games.  So don't use Vista if you can avoid it.  This is just another way big 3v3 matches end up failing -- if someone doesn't bog the game down with their slow computer, someone will crash out because they're using Vista.The economy is unique and horrible.  The economic model in the game is similar to Total Annihilation but with a couple of differences: map control quickly becomes almost completely meaningless and base defenses are vastly improved over what they were in TA.  TA was largely a war of attrition against your enemy -- he builds 2 fusion plants, you kill 1.  He builds 3 more, you kill 2 more.  Due to the improved defenses of SupCom, that doesn't happen.  By the time you can break through your opponent's defenses to destroy his fusion plant, you might as well skip the fusion plant and blow up his Commander instead, ending the battle.So typical long games degenerate into both sides hunkering behind their defenses until one side can launch a single, fast, devastating attack that breaches the defenses and immediately ends the game.  The long, continuous back and forth battles of TA are gone, I am sad to say.On smaller maps, you won't get to that point, and you can have some good gameplay, but then you're not playing the game that was sold to you on the box and in the screenshots.  You're doing low tech rushes on small maps and you're not going to reach the cool units proudly displayed to you in the magazine reviews.All of this leads to a shrinking community, too.  I made it as high as top 50 for my 1v1 ranking and it got to the point where I just couldn't find a ranked game to join.  I sit there for literally 10 minutes ""searching for game"" and there's no match, because nobody near my rating is playing ranked games anymore.  They all quit or they're all playing non-ranked games because ranked games on small maps honestly aren't that fun and don't represent the gameplay sold on the box.  There are top players who have posted screenshots of themselves with 1 hour timers or more, waiting for a match.This review makes me sad, because I loved TA and I wanted to love SupCom, but it's just not happening, and I don't think you're going to see any further sweeping changes to this game that will ever bring Ranked gameplay back into popularity.  You can find people playing custom player-made modifications and maybe you can get some enjoyment out of that, but regular ranked gameplay is DOA and that's too bad.Maybe the next game, Forged Alliance, will fix some of the problems, but I probably won't bother at this point.  Between the way this game released and the company's reaction to gameplay suggestions on their official forums (bans), I don't see myself trying another GPG product until they can prove they've really turned things around.",2,Supremely Flawed,1187136000,"08 15, 2007"

The first thing is that the playing field could have been made bigger.  As it was it was a square in the middle of my widescreen monitor.  If the screen was made bigger things would have been bigger and I would have enjoyed the game a lot more.  My second gripe is that the map that is supposed to be clickable wasn't which was very irritating having to go from room to room over and over again.

You play hero X, get involved with a grand malevolent scheme, thwart evil plans... blah blah blah.  The story takes a huge back seat in this game, moving on.The combat is the highlight of this game I believe, as should be expected of the makers of the Star Ocean series.  You have your choice from a few different weapons each having unique attacks that you earn through use.  You can combine up to 5 of these standard attacks to form your combo any way you see fit.  You eventually learn one power attack (Volty Attack) for each weapon.  I pretty much hack and slashed my way through every battle even though you can block and counter.  I found that after you had attacks that could break the enemies guard you had basically won the fight.  You can also call on your partners to use their various attacks once you get to a point in the story.  Finally you can change formations on the fly which allow you to surround enemies and pound them or do flanking formations and other such things.  The only thing that sucks about all of this is that you gradually open these features with the story so you're forced to wait quite a while before combat gets even remotely interesting.Combat aside, this game is basically one big distraction of collecting friends Suikoden style.  The crappy part is you don't get a castle/stronghold like in Suikoden, you simply collect 100+ equally worthless allies (Because your main character is all that really matters) while you wait for something to happen in the story.  This drove me completely bonkers.  I was so bored sometimes in this game I would repeatedly have to sleep or leave my game running just to get the story to advance because quite frankly I didn't care to collect every character after a while.  In Suikoden you felt compelled to collect everybody because every now and again they acutally did something additional for you like sell you stuff or teleport you, not the case in Radiata Stories.In summary, this is a collection game.  The story is superficial and cliche, the combat is fun but one dimensional, and everything takes a side note to making friends.

So I approached Sonic Unleashed with cautious optimism and low expectations.  Lower then that... we are talking about being marginally impressed that the disk didn't catch fire in my disk drive.  So, that was the frame of mind I was in when I started the game for the first time.  I have to say, (with that in mind) that I was rather impressed.The bad first: this is not the return to the kings of gamming status that the blue blur previously enjoyed, it's more of a baby step in the right direction.  This makes Unleashed, by the standards of the rest of market, an average game- but by the standards of recent history it is a good Sonic game.  Also on the bad side is the bane of almost all 3D platformers- the camera is not your friend and doesn't always agree with you as to what you should be looking.  And this may just be me, (and it probably is) but Sonic's controls are somewhat loose and this can lead to missing some tricky jumps.On to the good news.  The story kicks off with an epic throwdown between Sonic and Dr. Robotnik (look kids, I'm old and I refuse to call him ""Eggman"" it sounds like a bad breakfast sandwich), but when Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds to transform in to Super Sonic, Robotnik reveals that the whole thing is a trap and uses the power of the Emeralds to split the world and releases some dark beast trapped inside.  As a side effect, Sonic is transformed in to a werehog, a powerful brawler compared to his usual speedster form.  Sonic then falls back to earth and lands on a small flying creature that loses its memory.  Calling his new friend ""Chip"", Sonic sets off to try and recover Chip's memory and set things right.  But the werehog form stays with him- during they day Sonic his himself, and at night he turns into the werehog.  Daytime Sonic has finally regained the sense of speed that has been lacking in the latest entries- even flashing into old school 2D sections.  Sonic can even (finally) live up to his name and gain Mach speed, creating a shockwave in front of him- allowing him to defeat enemies without breaking his rhythm to attack.  Add to the package quick side-steps and the ability to drift around corners make this probably the best Sonic experience in recent memory.  Nighttime brings out the werehog, who's stages play out like a traditional 3D platformer ah-la Prince of Persia or God of War.  Ledge climbing, pole swinging, box pushing, and lever pulling are all accounted for.  Combo based combat and quick-time event kills round out the package- nothing terribly original, but all of it fairly well executed.So how does Sonic Unleashed stack up?  If you're just an occasional platformer player, or a casual fan of Sonic- this is an average game.  While everything is done fairly well, there's nothing too terribly exciting to be found here.  But for long time Sonic fans, or for hardcore platformer fans- Unleashed is definitely worth a look.  It may be average, but it's much better then Sonic has been lately.",3,"Sonic Unleashed, A Step in the Right Direction",1227484800,"11 24, 2008"

Nevermind how a cat or a dog can summon zombies or cast fire balls.There are 3 combat settings for your pet - `passive', `defensive', and `aggresive' and 1 active command you can give them - the above mentioned command for going to town to sell items.* You can learn permanent `identify' and `town portal' spells although they take up your `extra' spell slots of which you have 4 total.* Vendors can have randomly but rarely set and unique items for sale and their selection is more or less suited to your current level.-----------These are some things that scew my opinion of this game towards unfavorable:- There is no narrative background or backstory/lore, just a very rudimentary plot.- The main dungeon chain is very linear, it is basically a long series of tunnels with different graphics but ultimately with identical gameplay throughout.- Models, fonts, and sounds are very cartoony and by cartoony I mean they look and sound like the core target demographic was 2-6 year old children  I'm not exaggerating) For instance some later levels have `goblins' which look like cute bubbly monkeys, and so do the undead; dragonkins look like red versions of Barney the Dinosaur, etc. Mobs and environmental details are too big compared to the size of the areas they are in, which further enhances the cartoonyness and the cramped feel of the levels.- Combat looks cartoony, has exaggerated spell effects, etc. The maximum zoom out is not good enough. There are frequently too many mobs on the screen without any good reason for it.- Loot in general drops too often. Items can be enchanted, however enchanting always has a totally random effect (you don't know what you're paying for and getting). Items can be socketed with gems that come in a dozen or so varieties with different magnitudes of effects of each. That's it. There are no `charms' that you keep in your inventory, there are no `jewels', `runes' or `runewords' so the variety of upgrades is lower than in D2 and not nearly as interesting.- There are literally about 20 setting options... that includes graphics, sound, and... that's it. There are no settings for gameplay nor any option to change controls or key assignments.--------Conclusion. It's not Diablo 2.5. It is much closer in its scope to Diablo 1 than D2.

Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself having a lot of fun playing through this game.  Granted they're not bringing anything new to the table, but sometimes sticking to the tried and true methods works fine.  In this case it did, while it's not original, I still found this game quite fun.  They're using the Unreal graphics engine, but they seem to have designed it to be a lot more like Half Life 2.The storyline is also much improved in my opinion.  It doesn't feel as completely outrageous as the first game.  The first game was so out there that it became sort of stupid after a while.  But Blacksite deals more with developing new technologies.  So you spend most of your game fighting these super soldiers and robotic machines.  There are some alien creatures to fight as well, and they look a lot better than the ones you fought in the first game.  They actually look a little like the things from Independence Day, in their battle suits, but walking on all fours.  There are also these behemoth like creatures that come out of the ground that you have to kill.An added element that I thought was really cool was that you get to drive around in vehicles this time.  Usually I'm really iffy about these things because it's always a gamble when it comes to vehicle controls.  Luckily the vehicles are fairly easy to control in my opinion.  The only problem I have is that you can go really fast with them and it's hard to control at certain speeds.  Then again... I've never seen a game handle the speed functionality all that well.  I think Halo is the only one I can think where I felt pretty satisfied with the vehicle controls.Like in the last game you do get a squad that can work with you.  This actually goes on for most of the game.  Thankfully the AI is still good in this regard; the squad never really seemed to get in my way and was actually helpful rather than a detriment.  I like seeing that companies are finally starting to get these aspects correct.The weapons in this game were pretty run of the mill.  I felt like I had access to more alien technology in the last game, but the lack of this didn't hurt this game any for me.  I really enjoyed using the sniper rifle a lot in this.  That functionality was better compared to the last game, if I remember correctly.The environment this time around was a lot more destructible and I found that a lot more fun.  One part that was kind of annoying, though, was that you could destroy these crates, but there was never anything in them!  Don't these developers know that if you can destroy crates in a game you put ammo or some other incentive in there?  They did keep the dossier search from the last game.  This encouraged me to search out the environment and world a lot more and I'm glad they kept this feature as well.If you really enjoyed Half Life 2 and games of that ilk, then Blacksite: Area 51 won't steer you wrong.  Sure you might not be nearly as engrossed with it, but it's a fun game.  It's definitely not worth full retail price, but it's worth getting when the price drops.  It's actually not a very long game either, but I feel like it's just the right length.  This is the type of game you don't want hitting epic levels, because it would just get overly redundant.  It never reaches that point and the game feels like it's just long enough.",4,Major improvement!,1262131200,"12 30, 2009"

The 2 main things that I really didn't like about the game was that the game play was very repetative...it's just fancy running (although it is very fun).  The game seemed to focus too much on the parkour side of the game and felt like they left everything else blurred.  Running was basically the only thing you could really do, fight was only optional occasionally. The next main thing in which I've never had to complain about in a game, was the lighting. I was constantly having to change the brightness level to keep up with it, outside is way to bright and inside is way to dark with no auto brightness changes (kinda like if she had to think about changing the dialation of her eyes). The game is well worth a rental, but should probably wait until it hit's the bargain rack to buy it.I only got about halfway through the story before I starting getting tired of the game, I tried replaying it once after that but still the same...My advice, Think before you buy...I do really hope they come out with a second one that focuses on more than just the parkour side of it. If people wish to argue that that's just the type of game it is...then why have the fighting option in the game at all?

Movement control is clunky, especially since you have to use the the ""look"" command in specific (VERY specific) onscreen hotspots to perform anything but the most basic of actions.  Has some serious glitch issues as well (eg, I died during a boss fight, yet the cinematic showing the boss' death played and I went to the next level).  And for some reason, the only way to walk quietly is crouched down.  Hunh.The story is silly.  Omega 19 (A fatty acid?) killed your family, and now they're going to blow up the world.  Or some other run-of-the-mill badnik stuff.  I didn't care, and you probably won't either.  The journeyman voice cast mostly gets the job done, though the lead actress is both lousy and miscast.  One of the villains died twice in the script, too.The big beef with this puppy is the challenge.  Not the actual game-play; that's standard sneaky stuff.  Some of the solutions just don't make a lot of sense.  For example, a puzzle makes you avoid setting off a heat sensor by running into a freezer for a few seconds first, apparently lowering your body temperature.  Not only would this not work (to drop her body temp at all she'd have to just about freeze to death), it's not even explained what's happening when you're in the freezer.Elsewhere, you have to bug a room that has a character in it.  Problem is, you don't know at this point what she looks/sounds like.  When you walk down a corridor a short audio clip of someone speaking plays once, though on some playthroughs it fails to play at all.  You then have to crawl through the ventilation system (avoiding the cliche police) and set the bug, though you can't even see the people you're listening in on when you do.  If the audio clip didn't load, you'll have no idea what it is you're even doing.If you get stuck, and with all the nonsense in this title you will, you have to run from room to room, using that frustrating ""look"" command to find the miniscule hotspots, then guess what the game's screwed-up logic wants you to do.  And the levels are surprisingly linear for a game like this.  Some of the guards just stand there and stare at each other, too.  No talking, just staring, making it so you have no chance to take 'em out silently.  Who does that?  You can't even distract them.I gave it two stars, because some of the puzzles actually are kind of fun and the stealth, once you get used to the clunk factor, is handled tolerably well.

I am a GTA fan and I understand their is going to be some foul language in games of that type, but gee whiz! This game takes it to a new level with the use of the ""f"" word being used in my opinion, 100 times that of GTA.  They need like a language filter or something on games that way those of us to enjoy openworld games can play them and have fun w/o hearing all the frequent profanities.  So bluntly put, the language in this game is horrible!  If they would have did it along the lines of GTA it would have been more tolerable, even though not good still to even have profanity in a game.  Games can be a blast w/o all that mess.  So have got that out of the way, the gameplay is a blast!  Vehicle physics are kind of rough though and not as smooth as GTA i.e. the driving of the cars and boats.  The graphics are pretty good too.  I love the mansion. That is cool.  They have really neat cars and boats as well.  I like the fact too that you can hire your own henchmen and driver.  You can call a car from your garage from anywhere and your driver will bring it to you in a matter of seconds..same goes for your boats if you are in a boathouse location.  There may be other locations to call boats from but I haven't discovered it yet.  In the game, you buy property, do deals, take down enemy gangs, etc on your way back to the top to claim your empire.  Overall, language not included, this game is fun.  But if I would have known then, what I know now, I would have just stuck with GTA and would have went out and bought D1 drift racing instead.  Considering the language just makes this game a chore to enjoy without wanting to bring it back and trade it in. My wife could hear me playing the game from the other room and even she was disgusted and admitted that even GTA is better than this game. So being the GTA fan that I am, I just can't really recommend this game to anyone.  Parents be forewarned.

The game is boring and pointless.The plot is simple: the player assumes the role of &quot;The Postal Dude&quot; and, each day, sets off to complete a list of boring tasks, like going to the store for milk.  Invariably each mundane task ends in disaster as various nutty groups in the game burst in and start shooting.The game plays up the &quot;choice&quot; the player has, whether to be passive or to &quot;go postal&quot; with various weapons.  There's no reason to play passive, and the novelty of the over-the-top violence gets old fast.  Characters spout inane dialog, and the only high point of the game is when Gary Coleman (yes, Gary Coleman) makes an appearance at a mall which, of course, ends in a gun battle.Although powered by the Unreal engine, Postal 2 looks drab.  Out of the box, the game has some serious bugs, including ridiculously long load times between levels.  This gets frustrating fast as there are so many level changes to get from point A to point B.  A recent patch has fixed this issue, but the game remains a pointless exercise in futility.Sometimes the saving grace for a bad single-player game can be the multiplayer option.  &quot;Postal 2&quot; does not have multiplayer.  Instead, you have to actually purchase the multiplayer add-on for $9.95.  Running With Scissors might have scored an extra star had it released the multiplayer part for free, as was the case with the &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; multiplayer expansion, &quot;Enemy Territory,&quot; which started life as an expansion to RTCW and ended up being a free stand-alone product.You're better off spending the $20 on the vastly superior &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; or, for ten bucks more, &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.&quot;  Either choice is a better one than the terminally boring &quot;Postal 2.&quot;",1,Not worth the code it was compiled with,1071792000,"12 19, 2003"

You have the easy PS2 feel, dual-analog control pads, and a comfortable fit. You can install the drivers or not. It doesn't really make a difference because Windows will recognize it.The problem with this Gamepad is that it is not very durable. I bought and tested this controller with MVP Baseball 2005 & Need for Speed Underground 2. What happened is, I had to take the controller back 3 times to have it replaced because the analog sticks would give out or get stuck in a certain postion. Now, in MVP Baseball, for example, you need the right stick to dive/slide with. Well, the analog stick stuck to the right in 2 of them I tried, so that ends up leaving you to have automatic fielding because you can't get to the ball when the player is diving for no reason. With Need for Speed, I found that the 1 controller where the left analog stick went out, the cars were just out of control.There are many reviews online as I have found that confirm that Logitech never addressed this controllers issues. Even Tech. Support kept telling me I had just bought a bad controller when I called them on each one.Be aware, once the analog stick goes, whether it is 2 days or 2 months, you can't calibrate it.

They have never played any type of video game before (not even the Angry Birds app). Their parents don't own a Wii console, so I bought this game so they could play it whenever they're over at my place. Since I only have one controller, I managed to persuade them to take turns (even though they squabble).With that being said, Disney Princess My fairyTale Adventure is a fun game for young girls. There are four kingdoms (Cinderella, Ariel, Belle, Rapunzel). Truth be told, I am disappointed that there weren't a lot to do at Princess Tiana's kingdom, especially since my nieces love the Princess and the Frog. (You finish Tiana's level in less than 10 minutes.)As an adult, I found this game to be redundant in its gameplay, but for a five-year-old, this game was absolutely charming. Even though this game was fairly easy in its gameplay (you are provided with a basic tutorial at the very start of the adventure), I had to provide some assistance. They had the most amount of trouble with the control stick on the nunchuk (steering). The C and Z buttons on the nunchuk aren't required in this game. So whenever I sense their mounting frustration, I took control of the nunchuk, while they manipulated the Wiimote. However, the more they play, the less they need me to take control of the nunchuk.The good thing is that you cannot get lost, even if you didn't understand the instructions of the quests from the princesses and other familiar characters. You are provided with a bright shooting light that leads you to your next mission.The gems (money) are scattered throughout the kingdoms and you can use them to buy accessories, outfits, hair dos, tiaras, flowers (for your garden), furniture (for your room) at the Wishing Well Store. My nieces enjoyed customizing their character's appearance, exploring the different fairytale kingdoms (the kingdom is linear in its story), transforming the imps into sprites. My neices didn't find the imps to be scary at all. In fact, they giggled while trying to chase them. However, there was a particular mission (involving Lucifer the cat from Cinderella's Kingdom), in which one of them got a bit scared and thrust the remote in my hand because she didn't want to play. Honestly, I didn't find it at all scary so I couldn't understand why she got scared. Other than that, the missions/scenes are very child-friendly. They audibly oohed and aahed at Cinderella's opulent ballroom, her exquisite gown, the Beast's castle, and Rapunzel's beautiful, braided hair. Their favorite mission was fixing the pieces to the puzzles. They managed to pick that up pretty quickly and no longer needed as much assistance.The voice acting was fairly good. I grew up watching every Disney animated movie ever made and I believe Belle and Ariel's voices were similar to the original. However, I found Cinderella's voice to be dissimilar. I loved seeing all of my favorite characters such as Lumiere and Flounder to name a few (I'm a little princess at heart).As I said, I found this game to be redundant and I wish it came with more varied missions. I wish it was an open world game (but I suppose children don't mind as much). Plus, once completed (for its price,the game isn't that long), it has no replay value. So my initial star rating was 3. However, since my nieces liked this game a lot, and enjoyed replaying the same adventure/missions, I gave it a 4 star.This game would very much appeal to every little princess that is a Barbie/Disney Princess fan. Even though it's rated E, I think it's targeted for younger princesses between the ages of 4-8. Older princesses would probably find this game boring/unchallenging.

It is best summarized by probably its biggest issue: this game uses both screens of the DS for gameplay, but the space BETWEEN the screens is also used, meaning that there is a blind spot in the VERY CENTER of the gameplay.  It is nothing but frustration when you keep getting hit by enemies that come out of nowhere from that blind spot, and especially when you play the levels with moving platforms you find yourself being force to play with your character in that blind spot.Any platformer that thinks it's okay for your character to be invisible knows nothing about good platforming.I also remember disliking the bosses, but it's been so long that I can't quite remember why.",2,Why did Amazon recommend me this title?,1342742400,"07 20, 2012"

2117,109976,A35X82YUOSSOCS,B001B5U80K,"Rob C ""Rob""","[8, 10]","Torchlight is a very light action RPG in the same vein as Diablo.Computer SpecsIntel Core i7 860 @ 2.80 GHz, 8 gig RAM, Radeon HD 5850DocumentationThe game is pretty easy to jump in and play, but the manual does a good job at explaining how to do things within the game where necessary. It could be a little more in depth as far as explaining some of the mechanics of how things work, but since the game is simple it isn't too much of an issue.Character CreationThe character creation is very light compared to more in depth RPGs. There are only 3 classes, along with 4 character stats. There are also 3 skill trees where you can customize you characters skills. I played a Destroyer, which is your basic fighter class. I played my game on Hard. The difficulty level is selected when you create your character and can't be changed.Getting StartedPlay is based out of the town of Torchlight. This is where you get quests and sell items. There are basically 3 types of quests; story quests, kill monster X, find item x. The story is very weak and is there just to move you from dungeon level to dungeon level. It was so think that I didn't really care about it at all.GraphicsThe dungeons looked nice, but the characters were too cartoony for my tastes. That isn't to say they weren't well done, just not my style. I was able to play with the details turned up.GameplayLike most shiny new games, my initial impresions were good. It was fun to explore the dungeons, find new items, and encounter new monsters to fight. You do find a lot of items, in my opinion too many items. After my character go established (about midway through the game) I rarely found an item I wanted to use. There are just so many items it becomes a chore to look at each one to see if you want it. Luckily you have a pet that you can send back to town to sell your items so you don't have to slog back to town. There are also town portal scrolls so you can go to town and return pretty quickly.  So if you want to you can pick up everything and sell what you don't need for some money. One nice feature is that you can spend your money to enchant your items. This almost always bestows a bonus to your item, but it also has a chance to do nothing (and waste your money), or strip all the bonus off your item. My items were disenchanted once all game, so it didn't happen often, but it did happen on my best item so it was a little disappointing.It didn't take too long for the game to get boring to me for several reasons. The first it was too easy. During my fights I was able to just rush in and click without needing to think. There wasn't any challenge after my first 5 hours or so until the very end. That is another 25 + hours of mindless clicking. There are so many health and mana potions I never had to ration what I used.  Maybe it is better on Very Hard, but I am not interested in doing another play through.The second reason for bordom was the lack of meaningful choices. You can accept or deny quests, but since you are here to play I don't why you would, other than you just want to get through the game. There aren't any repercussions . Since the game was so easy, I didn't have to think very much about what items I equipped. The most meaningful choice you have to make is whether you try and enchant your items since there is a risk of removing all bonuses.The End GameI finally got my wish for some difficulties during the end game. The final fight was very tough. The problem was it just wasn't fun for me. It was just some mindless avoidence while trying to do some damage. Maybe it was because I had already endured so much bordem.Overall score (1 to 10): 5If you are after a very light game that doesn't require much thinking, there is some enjoyment to be had. Since I got the game on sale I don't regret the purchase too much, but I wish my compulsion to finish games didn't drive me to keep playing until completion. I don't remember Diablo being so mindless, but maybe it was. Looking at the scores from other players and reviewers you can see that my mediocre score is in the minority, so there are a lot of people enjoying the game.",2,Not sure why the gane gets so much love,1293840000,"01 1, 2011"

Most missions involve shooting down waves of bad guys with your rifle or revolvers. There are numerous side missions, from pony-express relays to poker playing and tracking down wanted men.The game is pretty typical of its genre. Pony express missions involve ""go here! No, go there! Wait, go to a third spot!"" within a time limit. Hunt-and-find missions abound. The plot is also pretty standard. You start with Colton and his ""dad"" out tracking some game. ""Dad won't last more than one mission,"" says I. Sure enough, in the very next area he's slain. Life was cheap in the Old West.The graphics are sort of a mixed bag. On one hand they don't look ""stunning"" in some parts, at least as high-quality as you've come to expect from recent XBox releases. On the other hand, sometimes when you're riding your horse across the desert and the sun is setting behind rock formations, it is simply *gorgeous*. I also have to comment that the horse movements are really nicely done. The way the horse's muscles move and the various gaits are right on.The sound is reasonable. The voice acting isn't bad, and beyond that you just get the shot noises from the various guns. It's not in your face, but really it doesn't need to be. Being in the west was about being in a vast landscape with silence around you.There were a few glitches with the game. If bad guys were up on the second floor of a building, you could often see their shadows *through the floor* to know where they were. Also, the red dots on the mini-map to point out enemies was nice, but it also gave you a sort of xray vision to pinpoint their locations even if you couldn't visually see them.I know this is a mature title, but I found the excess of blood spurting and obscene language to be a bit much. This was the Old West, and yes, there was blood. It doesn't need to rain across the entire screen. Yes, they were cussers. But the language they used back then would have been different than some of what they say in the game. I'd much rather have had authentic badmouthing than to have them use some of the nasty phrases the game features.That all being said, I did have a lot of fun playing this, even if at times it felt a bit like I was Link riding all over Hyrule doing my various quests.

I mean, after playing games like The Last of Us and Tomb Raider my expectations were very high for this game.  Now, don't get me wrong, as far as stealth-games go, Blacklist brings it all together nicely especially on ""Perfectionist"" mode where errors even in small doses will get you killed instantly.  In other words, your technical ability to execute stealth-kills and your movement in-and-out of cover needs to be spot on.Where I was disappointed is in the visual execution of the overall game.  This game looks like all the other Splinter Cells.  There's no new innovative look to raise the bar of the series, it looks just as bland and glosssy as it did in Chaos Theory.But that's it, don't expect anything eye-popping about the game.  If you're just in it for the stealth, and enjoy the challenge of moving within a controlled environment filled with threats and having to negotiate your movement and prioritizing targets - then Blacklist is your game.

However, if there ever was one, Rayman Origins has come closer to that goal than any other game I have ever played.

It's got the perfect ergonomic grip for my hand, a great texture and feel and the ability to go wireless/wired is a great benefit.Fact is: I don't love this mouse. I don't even like it. I desperately want to, but I can't.I picked up the Mamba over this Summer, and it's been... unpleasant. The battery lasted for a month before it stopped holding more than 30 minutes per charge. I contacted Razer to get a replacement. They never responded. I ended up buying a replacement battery directly and it lasted roughly two months. If it weren't for the USB capability it'd be unusable.When it works the mouse is amazingly accurate, and the accuracy/speed was astounding... so long as the mouse NEVER lifts off your desk. If the mouse is picked up (even SLIGHTLY) the cursor jumps about 300-350px on screen. I've never had this happen with any other mouse. Needless to say, this is disruptive in gaming if you need to adjust your mouse. You'll be trying to line up a shot... and suddenly you're looking up/down or facing the wrong direction. Not good.Other times the mouse partially stops responding (e.g. I can move left/right, not up/down.). I've tried updating firmware, drivers, getting support from Razer. Nothing helps. Razer has not been responsive to the issue.To top it off, the Mamba DOES NOT work with the Razer ExactMat. The laser just does not track on the surface.This is just not what you expect from a mouse that costs $120. I took a risk on the Mamba and feel burned. I feel disappointed in Razer's quality control later. My Razer Onza Tournament controller died a month in to ownership, and the Razor Mako speakers I have actually melted the plastic on my floor guard due to excessive heat. My Characias headset?

These games are truly original -- which you can tell because, since Tony Hawk 1 first came out, there've been a million imitators.  But as always, nothing beats the original.If you've played either of the previous THPS games, you know the drill.  You can pick from a number of customizable professional skaters and skate through a variety of unique environments where you'll find lots of places to do your tricks.Even if, like me, you have no interest in actual real-life skateboarding, this game is a blast.  The two-player modes are fun, but the game's signature is &quot;Career Mode&quot;, where you're given a number of goals to complete in each environment before you can &quot;unlock&quot; the next world.  This is great because it keeps the game from being overwhelming.  You can learn the massive number of tricks gradually and feel a sense of accomplishment at every step of the way as you check another task off your to-do list.  (Some are very easy, but others can be tricky.)A couple of caveats: one is that, while the environments in this game are more fun and more vividly realized than in THPS2, I found the gameplay to be somewhat easier this time around.  I ran through the level goals pretty quickly -- even the secret tapes were much easier to find.The other caveat: for parents of young kids, the game can be a little bloody.  On the one hand, it enhances the realism of the game, but only to a limited extent considering that the beaten-up characters always get right up and start skating again immediately after each bloodbath.  It's a little gruesome, but if your kids can handle it without freaking out, they'll probably love the goriness.Great soundtrack, too -- but my two favorite songs, &quot;Blitzkreig Bop&quot; and &quot;Fight Like a Brave&quot; are near the end of the rotation!

It first started with the status of the fast and furious Mario Kart series. Then, it was more laid back towards the putters with the wild and wacky Mario Golf series. After that, it took a turn towards aces with the Mario Tennis games for the Nintendo 64, and last year with the Gamecube. Still, there are a few other sports that are going to have the Mario bandwagon soon. Within the next year, there will be the European football, or soccer hyped Super Mario Strikers. But in the meantime, a Spring and Boys Of Summer tradition called baseball.Mario Superstar Baseball for the Nintendo Gamecube, is a fast paced and eclectic gamers paradise through the world of baseball. The game really goes a lot deeper from the Super Mario Briothers series past and present with so many characters like Yoshi, Luigi, Mario, Peach. Also, some old favorites like the flying goombas, and dry bones from Super Mario Brothers 3, Koopa Troopa, and so many others. Arguably, the graphics are just delightful, and the gameplay and control is very easy to learn for some characfters, whether it is in the pitching, or the batting, and simply within the outfield. The fields also blend within each unique feeling of the Mario worlds with courses from the Princess Castle, and even the wild and wooly jungle worlds of Donkey Kong.

I have played Vice City, Vice City Stories, Liberty City, and San Andreas and all of them were hilarious, wild, fun and exciting. Good story lines, comedy on the radio, hilarious graphic effects when you hit something with your car, etc. The old GTA was a fun game for adults that was primarily action based satire, just my kind of fun! I was so excited about GTA4. I heard so much about it that I couldn't wait for it to come out. When I played it I wasn't excited by it, but I figured it would pick up in a bit. It didn't. The main character isn't someone I particularly have any interest in, the other characters are okay, but nothing special. The graphics are really awesome but the radio is terrible to listen to because there really isn't anything funny on it, unlike that of its predecessors, especially GTA VCS. As far as comedy goes, one of my favorite comedians, Katt Williams, was on it and I didn't even chuckle. That hurts. The missions were alright, but it was sometimes hard to tell where you were supposed to run or shoot.

It's quite sturdy and well-made, it doesn't have any problems registering hits and it folds up nicely. I should've loved it, but I merely sort-of liked it. Why?First, the drums wander. A lot. My problem initially was with the yellow cymbal migrating slowly to the left each time that I hit it. I managed to fix that by angling the cymbal so that it was point downward (like it shows in the picture), instead of having it straight out. It's still a problem, but not nearly as much. I also found that angling the support bar for it back a little (again, like in the picture), prevents another problem I had, which is that each time I hit it, it went down a little like a nail being driven by a hammer.But there's a wandering problem that I can't fix and that's the red drum slowly rotating each time that I hit it. There's no way to fix it completely in place and unless you are relatively gentle, it's going to move. The blue drum also has this problem. The green probably does, but I haven't used it much.Despite those two problems, this is a pretty darn fine set! Like I said, it's quite sturdy. I feel like I could smack it around all day and not have it break on me. Also, I rather liked the foot pedal. Some people have complained about the ""Guitar Hero"" logo sticking up and that it forced them to wear shoes to use it. I just played in my socks and had no problems.I can't really compare this to the standard drum kit for the ""Guitar Hero"" games, since I haven't ever really used it. I do know that this one is merely ok, and while I might be willing to buy it, I certainly wouldn't be willing to at the current price. Cut it by 50% and then I'd look at making a purchase.Bottom line: if the drums are important to you and you're not happy with the basic controller that came with the system, you might well like this one. The minor problems of wandering drums can probably be fixed pretty easily by someone with a drill, some screws and a few minutes of effort. But if you're merely fond of the drums, well, you can probably find a better deal elsewhere.",3,Bang the drum slowly... unless you want it to move everywhere!,1259798400,"12 3, 2009"

WHenever you go sideways you actually strafe sideways, it is really inconvienient. The controls are terrible. You will see what I mean when you get to the first part of the training. You have to run around a room in an extremely short time. I had to do it like 8 times. Basically to beat it I walked straight, strafed left, then went backwards, and narrowly got it. Then the combos, they are so difficult to pull off. I honestly feel that the creators were trying to make it as hard as possible to lash out against the society or something.The backgrounds are terrible. I rented this game for one day and was fed up with it after 5 minutes of the first level. You honestly are going to see alot of boxes, in some of the most uninspired and retarted rooms ever. One room was a square. O thats right, they are all squares, with 2 or 3 boxes of course. Can't forget those boxes.The guns are the worst actually. When you shoot 6 bullets with a gun, mabye 5, your girl looks at the roof. She cannot hold a gun straight. The target practice is basically 3 targets going directly upward. I mean seriously, this chick is an operative, and the recoil on her gun actually has her looking towards the roof in 6 shots or less. O but wait, lets say she walks while she shoots, now magically her gun has no recoil and she is fine. So whenever you want to shoot anything and actually hit it with 2 shots or more, you have to move around. Want to know something else? The guns are stupid.The combos are hard to pull off, and worthless. I could care less about snapping that guy, I only have 2 arms.

151,118451,A33I2QV713UCT5,B001N1C1J8,RAF,"[3, 4]","If I were to sum up Demigod in one word, it would be 'lacking'. For starters, there are very few maps. The lack of maps and general lack of custom maps means that it's not a very long lasting game by any means. Then there's the small amount of demigods to choose from, and two of them need to be unlocked by playing a multiplayer game. Demigod is an interesting concept, but the game just doesn't have enough content to carry its own weight.The graphics in Demigod are excellent. This is the area where Demigod truly shines. Demigod looks amazing on the highest settings, and still manages to look pretty good on medium settings. But the fact is, graphics can only do so much for a game.The sounds in Demigod are fairly decent. The voice acting isn't that bad, either. Being an Unreal Tournament fan, I appreciated the various announcements the announcer would make after getting a certain number of kills.The gameplay is very much like DoTA. Demigod is more or less a graphically appealing DoTA, really. If you've played DoTA, then you'll know what to expect. Still, Demigod is a bit more competitive than DoTA, and seems more of a competitive sports game like UT2003 was. Players control their demigod, which levels up and gains experience. There's also an skill tree where the player can choose what abilities or stats to give their demigod. Demigod, unfortunately, is one of those games that doesn't have an actual singleplayer campaign. This just ends up hurting it; lack of a single player campaign was a definite let down; it could have been really interesting if done right.Demigod's AI is pretty bad at times. It just isn't that smart. As such, playing singleplayer games isn't a substitute for multiplayer. Demigod's multiplayer is only fun if you're playing with friends or people you know. New players basically can't get on ANY games on the internet, because they get kicked for not being 'good enough'. Demigod's multiplayer community is easily one of the worst I've ever seen for a game. It's so horribly unfriendly to new players that it makes playing online multiplayer virtually impossible. If you want to play multiplayer, you'll have to do it with friends, because otherwise, you won't get to play at all.To make matters worse, there are VERY few mods out there. There are only one or two custom maps that I've seen, but I haven't even bother trying to install them. There aren't even any good custom demigods around, which is pretty disappointing.One of the things I appreciate about Demigod is that it uses Impulse instead of DRM like Steam or Securom. You only need to register your key to get patches, and you don't have to patch your game if you don't want. Impulse doesn't run in the background and take up space, either. The fact that Demigod pretty much lacks DRM is a definite plus, although Impulse is still 'Steam lite'.Nevertheless, Demigod is fairly lacking all around. It lacks maps, doesn't have that many characters to choose from, and suffers from a horrid multiplayer community and lack of a singleplayer campaign. I'd only recommend buying it if you have friends to play with. Otherwise, I wouldn't even bother buying it unless you can get it for really cheap.",2,"An interesting concept, but it can't carry its own weight",1285286400,"09 24, 2010"

12340,45523,A2DGSWAKU0VB4P,B0001I9YIK,Michael Clarkson,"[43, 45]","Having been an immensely popular comic-book series for some time, the X-Men have recently enjoyed a new level of mainstream recognition thanks to the live-action movies starring Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. Whether you've followed them for years or have just become a fan recently, X-Men: Legends is game you'll probably enjoy.GAMEPLAY: EXCELLENTA note: I played this on the GameCube, YMMV on other platforms.Gameplay is typical for a hack'n'slash console RPG -- your party roams through a number of dungeon-like levels and kills a bunch of baddies, picking up experience and various goodies along the way. The game is arranged into a series of missions (some long, some fairly short) spaced by interludes in the X-Mansion.Controls are generally good, and the character under your command will generally do exactly what you want, though sometimes large thrown objects will explode rather closer than you expect.  Attacking and moving are simple and intuitive, though stringing some of the longer attack patterns together can be difficult.  There is a limited ability to command those characters that are not under your direct control, but if needed it is a simple matter to take over whatever member of your party you wish. Enemies can also be thrown around -- off of bridges, into walls, and even into each other, making for some interesting battles.The camera, however, is problematic. Despite obvious efforts by the programmers to make view-obstructing surfaces transparent, you will often find yourself completely unable to see your characters. Even when this is not a problem, you will also experience difficulty on occasion in trying to see an enemy. The ability to zoom in or out is very limited, and consequently you will sometimes find yourself being blasted by opponents who are offscreen and unseeable.The incorporation of mutant powers is done fairly well, though at times it seems like the programmers worked a little too hard to come up with four different power attacks for each character. It seems odd, for instance, that Wolverine has any special attacks, or that Colossus has a special punch. It seems like any punch from Colossus would hit just as hard as this 'special' one. Additionally, it does seem a little strange for the mutantsto 'run out' of power (particularly Wolverine, whose attacks are all physical). This is a necessary concession to gameplay, however, and in most cases the attacks make sense and fit the character, so these are minor quibbles. The arrangement of attacks is also intuitive for the most part, with A and B special attacks for offense, X for buffs, and Y for the character's super attack (usually an area-effect blast rather than pinpoint destruction).The ally AI is fairly competent, though it tends to underutilize powers. AI characters also don't seem to use health packs, even when they are set to do so automatically. Thus they will occasionally die. They will also get trapped in doors at times, and, because there is some effect caused by bumping into each other, occasionally fall off bridges and die. However, a lot of these problems can be solved by having your friend pick up acontroller and join the fray. It's not too hard.Level design is a little uneven. Although some areas are very convoluted, progress is almost always linear, with only a few instances where there are genuinely different routes one can take through an area. Save points usually appear in every other zone of a mission, which is sometimes too infrequent, given the prospect of accidental character death. Additionally, there will be times when you need to have a particular X-Man in your group (usually Iceman or Magma will be required, but sometimes Storm or Cyclops), and you must pick your way back through a level to change out your team. You'll find yourself always using Magma or Iceman and trying to swap out other characters, but the game really isn't long enough for you to get used to them all. There is mercifully little key-hunting to do, and when a key or other pass is needed it can usually be found close to where it must be used. Additionally, just about everything in the levels can be destroyed, from trash cans up to (in some cases) walls. It doesn't all yield treasure, but if you're frustrated, having Magma or Wolverine blow up the scenery can blow off a little steam.The spoils of war are not terribly exciting. Characters can only use three accessories, and the effects of these aren't usually very interesting, though they can be quite helpful. Some accessories can also be purchased using ""tech bits"", but this monetary system feels stilted and artificial; additionally, these tech bits can be very hard to find at times. Most items can be sold for tech bits, but because of a limited inventory size this is not a reliable way to make a buck. Health and Energy packs are only rarely dropped when you need them. On one level my dying characters strode waist-deep through a sea of useless energy packs, with nary a save point (where health packs can be purchased) in sight. Additionally, because of an obscure and arbitrary cap on the number of health and energy packs that can be carried, you will find yourself passing up a whole zone full of them with ease, only to run out in the next zone, where there are none to be had.The only real awkwardness in the game setup was the menu system. There are different buttons for ""Back"" and ""Accept"", but in most cases ""Back"" also accepts your setup, while ""Accept"" sends you back to the game. Also, some actions at save points will return you to a menu once completed, while others will send you back to the game, forcing you to enter the save point and start the  process over again. The ""objectives"" system was also not particularly helpful, as some objectives only appeared on the list after being completed, and others never got checked off even if I did them. Ignoring that screen is easy, though.Despite the (mostly minor) problems, gameplay is a blast. The breadth of moves (and characters) available means that you'll probably never run out of ways to engage the enemy, and the destructability of the environment means that battles are visual treats. The first time Wolverine slashes a guy and knocks him THROUGH a wall, you'll know what I mean. Your exploration of the X-Mansion in the interludes also provides some nice insights into the massive web of backstory behind the X-Men, though it seems a little smaller than it should be. And I frankly had a ton of fun just getting around at times; there's a unique thrill in  ice-gliding through New York City as Iceman.STORY: EXCELLENTThe writers for the game have produced a very good story that lays out the situation simply enough for X-Men novices to understand what's going on, while simultaneously layering in a number of references for the comics' hard-core fans to enjoy. The various X-Men and their abilities are introduced gradually enough that we get an appreciation for most of them. The plot is reasonably tight, the various X-Men and villains all behavenaturally, and the dialogue, though occasionally stilted, never really bogs down.Thematically, however, the story disappoints. The usual arc of human hatred for mutants is nicely constructed, but the parallels to real life are drawn only tenuously. Given that the plot could have allowed a more convincing analogy to real-world terrorism, this is something of a disappointment. Also, the rapid end to the story sort of waves off the mutant vs. human problem, leaving the issue hanging without any real sense that progress has been made. The inclusion of a major, non-mutant, sympathetic character whose viewpoint changes even a little might have helped this out;  except for a brief cameo by Moira McTaggart, all the humans in the game appear as unrelenting monsters. A more on-the-fence character who comes down on the side of the mutants would have created a more optimistic closing.Given the usually lame and paper-thin stories one usually finds in games, however, this was much more fun and a lot meatier.AUDIO: MEDIOCREMost of the voice acting is quite good; Patrick Stewart shines as always. A few characters, however, feel a little off. Wolverine is particularly uneven -- sometimes dead on, sometimes sounding like a piggish moron. Cyclops also sounds a little too peppy, and Allison's voice grates on my ears. The music in the game, however, is seriously annoying. Outside of combat, the music is repetitve and droning, adding no pleasure and in some cases seriously detracting from it. It's nice that the tune changes in the proximity of enemies; however, the battle music is only louder, not better. Fortunately, the score is mostly quiet enough that you can ignore it.Sound effects are nothing to write home about, but not bad either.GRAPHICS: EXCELLENTThe graphics in this game are generally good, with just a few painful failings. The character models move realistically, and it's a real treat to see enemies tossed about by Storm's tornadoes. Most of the attack effects are strikingly good, though the buffing powers almost universally look lame. Character and enemy designs are very good during gameplay, but as many reviewers have noted, the heavy outlines of the pseudo cel-shadedtechnique cause the game's appearance to suffer in many of the cutscenes. The movie-style cutscenes look fine, though a few characters look distorted or rubbery.The environments in the game also look very good, for the most part. The Astral Plane, however, is horrible. You'll have to do several levels in this monotonous, semi-transparent, muddled hell-hole, and I grew to dread it.The character heads used in the HUD and the character screens are pretty uneven. Some of them look awesome, and others look simply hideous. Allison and Gambit look particularly bad, but ugliness, flawed proportions, or muddled texture are not uncommon. Which is unfortunate, because you see these heads constantly.REPLAYABILITY: AVERAGEThe game is pretty short, even more so if you don't partake in many of the Danger Room missions. The second playthrough offers the ability to choose the appearance of the characters from several iterations of the X-Men saga. The linearity of the levels means there's not much else new to do the second time around. However, the ""Danger Room"" feature from the main menu offers you a chance to play out numerous scenarios and battles, for some additional gameplay. You'll be able to get a little extra mileage out of this one, but not a lot.OVERALL: GOOD (76%)X-Men: Legends offers great hack-and-slash gameplay and an entertaining storyline, paired with a much-loved franchise and generally good graphics. There are a few sour notes in the graphics and programming, and the music is a boring droning mess, but these problems don't ruin the fun. Though not a game for the ages, Legends is a solid offering that will please hardcore X-Men fans and newcomers alike.",3,A solid game with a few rough spots,1097625600,"10 13, 2004"

If you do not like your particular ability tree, you can customize your own. You can also customize your characters looks. You can make it look like you if you wish. The only downside is that it can take a good deal of time just to make a character look half decent.Gameplay:In Oblivion, you are thrown right into the action as you sit in a prison cell(for no known reason) and suddenly confronted by the king and his body guards. From here the adventure begins. The Country side is perhaps the most beautiful you will see in a game. Each town is quite different than the other. Some towns are in the warm climate on level terrain and some are on snowy mountain tops and harder to navigate. Depending on what your character setup is, you can choose to join the theives guild, fighters guild or mages guild. It is quite obivious from the start of the game that you should partake in as many side-quests as possible. Not only to bring your skills up, but because it adds a whole new level of gameplay than if you were to just do the main quest. The biggest issue I had with the game was with the dungeons, keeps, caves and oblivion gates. They are all pretty generic in layout. It can get tiring (especially the oblivion gates) doing something you feel like you just did. Aside from that, interaction with characters in the cities, in your guild, and throughout the country makes the game all the more interesting. You'll run into highway men demanding money, theives and all sorts of ghostly and or monster like beings.

This title is a poorly made CGI movie with limited use of your PS3 pad. I am not sure you can call it a game. Great graphics can't compensate for wonky and limited controls, 3rd grade level puzzles and overplayed predictable story. Maybe I am jaded since I am still playing Skyrim and also just finished Portal 2. Those two titles are actual games where you are allowed to make liberal use the game pad. Portal 2 had amazing puzzles. Everything in UC3 just seemed tacked on to support one cut scene after the next or one more beautiful room with virtually no interactivity in it. Also, I can't believe after a 3rd iteration the gun play is even more wonky than the first two titles. How on earth did the game designers manage to do that? They stole the Gears of War 3rd person idea, but implemented it poorly.",2,It's Not A Game,1354233600,"11 30, 2012"

Unfortunately, one year later I started seeing that everything was going 3D, and that was the preferred choice among most gaming fans because everyone wanted realism, and me, growing up with the Super NES, wanted the PSX to continue having 2D games. It didn't turn out that way, and I decided in 1997 that video games were something I didn't need to bother with anymore.Warp ahead to 2005. I want to go back and discover old games I had missed the first time around. It turns out I missed a LOT of good games. First of all, here's the games I had from 1996-1999 (yeah, I continued to buy games after 1997, but not that many)-- Crash Bandicoot (the first one)- Mortal Kombat Trilogy- Mortal Kombat 3- Loaded- Road Rash- WWF Wrestlemania: Arcade Game- WWF In Your House- Syphon Filter- Dino Crisis- Castlevania: Symphony of the NightThat was it. Back then I thought for certain Mortal Kombat Trilogy would go down as the best fighter of all-time. Funny stuff! I also thought Loaded and Wrestlemania: the Arcade Game would be considered classics, too. I had NO idea that Castlevania game would still be considered popular in the year 2007. Owning that game when it came out was the best decision I made back then.That means I missed out on such wonderful, influential games like the Resident Evil series, Silent Hill, Medal of Honor, Metal Gear Solid, Dino Crisis 2, Crash Bandicoot 2 and 3, a whole bunch of RPG's, the Spyro series, the Mega Man Legends series (including X4) and a lot more.I have to be honest with you- I'm really glad I discovered these games in the year 2005-2007 (and I'm not done) because if I had gotten into them back when they first came out, memories of high school (I hated it with a passion) would have caused a distraction and a lingering feeling in the back of my head sparking memories I'd rather forget. I was in high school from '96-2000. Those were important years in the life of the Playstation. It was good to get away from gaming back then.So I'm happy I cleared my head and bought a bunch of fresh classics the last couple years. Even that Castlevania game sparks memories I'd rather forget. Luckily, nothing lasts forever, and the memories are starting to fade so I can approach those games I originally bought (and received) in a clear-minded light. However, if I DIDN'T have to go to high school, I'd love to go back and experience some of these games for the first time. Especially Silent Hill. Probably my favorite PSX game at the moment.",5,awesome,1174176000,"03 18, 2007"

Considering that my own life is hard enogh to (mis)manage, the idea that managing other virtual lives would be fun seems silly. But the core of the Sims is fun.I'm pretty sure that there are at least 800,000 Sims 2 expansion packs, and I'm sure that the Sims 3 is going to have the same. The problem is that the Sims 3 is nothing new. Yes, you can go outside. Yes, you can explore the city. No, this isn't as fun as the demo videos make it look. At its core, you'll still have to focus a lot on the mundane task of managing your Sim's skills and needs.This is so much like real life it kind of hurts. You spend 90% of your time at work or doing chores, and barely have any time left to do something fun like being rejected for sex. The game certainly has better dynamics for work, since you can elect to improve a skill, improve your co-worker relationships, or make some extra cash while at work. This does help reduce the horrible chore of earning a promotion. But even still I constantly found the time-management to be similar to the Sims 2.There are plenty of other improvements in the Sims 3. The updated house designer introduces the super-technology of angles! Finally, your sims can sit at 45 degrees like nature intended! This does help you design more interesting houses, but again, much of the core is untouched. Of course being able to walk around anywhere in the town is great and is definitely much needed, but honestly the novelty wears off pretty quickly, leaving you with the same unchanged gameplay dynamics.The Sims 3 feels like it could've used more to make it stand out and play differently from the Sims 2. Now, I was never a hard-core Simmer (I have no idea what Sim fans prefer to be called, and no, I do not care), but I always enjoyed the game. The Sims 3 I also have enjoyed, but I'm not about to buy 500 expansion packs just to experience some radically different gameplay that I was expecting to begin with. Somewhere deep in the EA secret volcano base (I assume they have one) they probably wanted the Sims 3 to have room for (lots of) expansions. Further, they created these dubious ""Sim points"" where players are expected to buy new furnitures or hair for real-world money.Overall, if you got bored with the Sims 2, you'll get bored of the Sims 3, probably quickly, because it is pretty darn sim-ilar. To hard core fans, this might not be a bad thing, but to someone that wanted to see a fresh new version of theseries, I am left unimpressed.",3,Sim-ply the Sims again!,1245542400,"06 21, 2009"

Apparently if you don't stand in the EXACT spot the game wants you to , you completely miss the mob. Now this mob shoots me with a type of poison that starts killing me very fast. No probably I have all kinds of healing available. I spend the next 2 minutes casting heals and drinking heal potions. It doesn't matter I end up still loosing because apparently this poison lasts around 3-4 minutes so there is ZERO chance for me to beat it other than shoot it before it gets close and hope the game doesn't have a bug.There are numerous instances like this. Then there are the character classes. They might have different names but they all blend together to the point they all feel the same. In fact you could start as a sorcerer and end up fighting like a warrior.The graphics are ok but there is a lot of tearing at times when the 360 apparently cannot process everything smoothly.Bottom line is I love RPG's but this game just didn't do anything for me other than frustrate and disappoint me.

Producers of the game have stated in on-line interviews that there would indeed be a fifth installment, but as of my writing it's apparently not under production.I bought and played this one essentially on the strength of the third item in the series, ""Escape from Monkey Island,"" which I adjudge to be far better.They seemed to have a winning recipe in that installment:  why did they completely overhaul the concept?Well, okay, not everything was overhauled.  The voice actors, atmosphere, and quirky sense of humor are all intact, but the game designers saw fit to completely revamp the way Guybrush moves around the screen.  And whether you set his movement to ""character-relative"" or ""screen-relative,"" it never seems to work right.Nor do the gamemakers think anything of including a lot of puzzles that rely on a timer, so you've got to manuever this difficult to control character around before a certain door closes, etc.  I don't think they had the right to do that, so to speak, while the character movement was so wonky.But the thing that really gets my goat is that they took the unique, beautiful cartoony look of Monkey Island 3 and replaced it with CGI drawn characters, which effectively robs this series of its central charm:  superior visuals.The look of the islands, the sky, the clouds, and even the characters in Monkey 3 was so well-done and charming that I stuck with that game just to enjoy the game's eye-candy.  I thought it was the game's greatest strength.  And that's precisely what they've monkeyed with -- pardon the pun.In fact, with the stunning visuals gone, the character of the gameplay rises to the fore, and the idiocy and frustration of many of the puzzles becomes unbdeniably apparent.In fact, I got so frustrated with Monkey 4 that, after getting about halfway through the game, I just sat there with a walkthrough trying to get through the rest of it.  Even with the walkthrough, though, it was still a slog!  The entire time I was cheating, I kept thinking, ""Sheesh.  I'm glad I didn't waste precious hours of my life agonizing over that puzzle.  I would simply never have guessed the solution, since THE SOLUTION DOESN'T MAKE ANY FLIPPIN' SENSE!"". . . which means if you'd like to go through this game straight, you've basically got to try to pick up every object, try every object you have on every other object in every possible screen.If you find this kind of thing fun, then knock yourself out.",2,not as amusing as the writers thought,1216771200,"07 23, 2008"

You are a gun for hire and it is one of your jobs that gets you in the mess that you find yourself in. Looks like you should have checked references on the last job you took, but now you get to come back with a vengeance and show everyone you're no one to be mess with.Graphically this looks like a very good game. the projector effect, however, will leave you slightly motion sick after a while. You don't to get to see too much of it unless you're about to die and then its as if the movie is about to come of the reel. The added commercials for the concession stand were an interesting touch to the game, but had me rolling my eyes about halfway through. What I want to know was there someone on the development team who had a screw loose and decided to go old school with frozen pickles and such? You will notice that apparently all the enemies that stand in your way have all the same parents, that's the only way I can think of why everyone is basically a clone of one another.The music was a fun surprise, a punk alt-rock type of vibe kept me from wanting to turn down the volume. The voice acting was impressive by names alone, sure some of the sections were very muffled, and thankfully there was sub-titles so you actual could figure out what was being said.The controls were pretty crisp for the most part, the d-pad to change weapons, right trigger to shoot, x for your sword, A to jump, and B to slide. Utilizing these buttons will basically see you through the game.This was an interesting game, I wish there was a bit more to it, or perhaps that there was going to be a sequel to it. There were a lot of good things about this game, especially the main character, a very good looking chick whose skills could put anyone down. The combat sections got very repetitive short into the game. You're going to find yourself, at least once a level, having to close these spawn doors, and defeat all the enemies. You'll also have sections called Rage Mode, which is where everything goes a kind of Sin City color mode and your main mission is to rack up back to back to back kills until there's no one left standing. To be honest this game kind of felt a little Kill Bill-esque. It really did fit that mold, but like I said there wasn't very much variety in combat.You'll start the game off with your pistols and a sword, and as the game progresses you'll all of a sudden have a flash back to remind yourself that you're actually holding more weapons, and upon completing an obstacle course you can use that weapon in the next section. You'll find that you have mini-guns, shotguns, and crossbows. You'll get plenty of time to use those weapons when you jump in the air, slide, or do a wall run, shooting while doing one of those activities will slow down the game and will allow you to mow through your opponent.Though I found this game a bit short, and repetitive I was still glued to my seat to get through it to know what happens.

That being said BO2 is a good game and being ranked #4 IMO is a job well done.CAMPAIGN: I only got about 3/4 thru but is my favorite of the series.  It's different, it makes sense, it plays like a dark movie, it doesn't have those long bs intros into each level that you can't bypass that all the COD's have had.  Only negative was the same jarring cut scene they'd show over and over as your plane lands as you complete each mission so lame why didn't they cut that ? Other than that, a fantastic campaign.ZOMBIES:  They look great, but I'm just not a Zombie guy cuz I need three other buddies that rule at Zombies just never got into it, but I did have a crew I ran with for a couple of games and I finally understood what the fun was all about, but I'm a lone wolf at COD, so if you love Zombies I'm sure you'll love this mode.MULTIPLAYER:  I liked the maps there is a huge variety, the updated graphics make a huge difference if you are a graphics whore like me.  You don't have a lot of weapons initially at your disposal tokens and ranking up have to unlock them.  Where is my M16 :)?  I think the best thing about the game that really stood out to me was the targeting system it just looks fantastic and feels satisfying when you get the kill.  I only dominated as usual in the only game mode I'm good at Domination and it felt great and satisfying because when your doing damage it's a blast game, but I think for me and the majority we all stink at the game lets be honest there arent that many GREAT COD players we all kinda stink lol. For example I played 30 games last night and there was only one player that I considered a really good player.  The kill streaks lose me they are better and better with each COD release, great if you have them and annoying if you don't cuz they are nearly all deadly, that's why I think hurts the game and what made MW so great, it was balanced.  You have 10 items you can select, perks, add ons etc, that's a great add to the game, you don't have to have a secondary and can double up on other items.  I did freeze or DISC about 5 out of 30 games that stunk but that will only improve and I'm not going to kill a review like many do because of opening day issues; it's COD it will get fixed.OVERALL & CONCLUSION:  A well made game, a nice package, the graphics are a big upgrade, some of the maps look much better than the others, like the LA map looked fantastic I thought.  A familiar COD other than the much better campaign, the menus are excellent, and I love the IDEA of Trent Reznor doing the music score.  However, he should have given us some classic NIN songs we could pull from as well.  The same menu composition gets old fast.  Remember that simple but perfect MW menu title sound that was perfect?

5872,110119,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B001BNFQKO,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[1, 3]","Niko Bellic is a veteran of war and ethnic strife in the Balkans. Tiring of a life of violence and brutality, he receives an invitation to move to Liberty City, where his brother Roman reports he has made a new life for himself involving fast cars and beautiful women. Moving to the States, Niko finds his brother's stories were exaggerated. He runs a cab firm and is in debt up to his eyeballs with various shady characters. Proving his usefulness in eliminating opponents, Niko finds various factions in Liberty City vying to employ his talents and his new life in a new country becomes even more violent than the one he left behind.Grand Theft Auto IV was released in 2008 and at the time of its release was reportedly the biggest-budgeted game of all time (a record later lost to The Old Republic) and the fastest-selling (since outstripped by Modern Warfare 2 and 3). Despite the title, it was the sixth 'main' game in the Grand Theft Auto series and the first in the series to appear on current-generation hardware, featuring massive advances in graphics over the previous games in the series. It was greeted with near-unanimous critical acclaim but fan reaction was more mixed, with criticisms over the toning down of the wackiness of the series and the reduction in game size and character customisation from the colossal San Andreas.In general terms, the game plays in an identical manner to Grand Theft Auto III, Vice City and San Andreas. Your character has the freedom to pick from one of several missions from one of several characters at a time, or can go off and do odd jobs for money or can simply chill out and explore the city. Given the leap to the next generation of hardware, it's surprising how similar the gameplay is to the previous titles in series. Of course, graphically the game is a massive leap forwards in quality and players will likely spend early parts of the game simply gawping at the sun rising over the ocean, or the monumental size of the city and its dozens of skyscrapers when seen from a helicopter. On PC, adding a graphics mod (like the mighty IceEnhancer mod, if your PC can handle it without instantly exploding) can make the game even look semi-photorealistic and absolutely jaw-dropping. Liberty City's fidelity to the real New York City is also startling: one of my NYC-based friends reported even finding his apartment building in the game, let alone faithful renditions of the Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty, MetLife Building, Grand Central Station and the Chrysler Building.A noticeable addition to the game is a cellphone, through which your character can receive missions and call up contacts. The cellphone (which also doubles as a camera and MP3 player) is a handy addition to the gameplay and provides the game with its biggest single step forwards over previous titles in the series: the ability to interact with other characters. In previous games, you could only interact with characters in missions and cut-scenes, and had no say over how your relationship with these people developed. In GTA4, you can ring up contacts and arrange to meet them outside of missions for drinks or going to shows or playing games. This improves your relationship with these characters, and at a certain point you can call on them for resources or favours. Additional depths to these characters are also revealed in conversations that take place during these meetings. The game essentially gives you some control over how interpersonal relationships develop during the story, which is fairly remarkable for a non-RPG.Unfortunately, a potentially paradigm-shifting mechanic bogs down into a minor annoyance when, whilst clinging to the roof of a truckfull of heroin with the driver trying to shake you off to your imminent death, you get a phone call from a friend asking you to play darts with him. When you say no because you are about to die in the face, they get the huff and your reputation points with the character go down. By the late-game period, when you have more than half a dozen friends and contacts, the calls and texts begging for you to hang out with them become a constant stream of annoyance, and this results in them being ignored by most players. Fortunately they are purely optional.The meat of the game, then, is the plot and the missions, and both are well-executed. The storyline is excellent, probably the best in the entire series, and is depicted through convincing writing and strong voice acting. Niko's character development is great, as he tries to be a good person but all too easily is dragged back to a life of violence and crime. This is Rockstar's latest attempt to present a three-dimensional protagonist who is realistic and complex but must also be capable of committing whatever mayhem the player wants him to and is their best attempt yet (Vercetti in Vice City being an unredeemable villain and CJ in San Andreas being too nice, conflicting frequently with the player's lunatic actions). Other characters are also excellently developed, with Niko's brother Roman and Jamaican friend Jacob being notable. For a game with an ethnically diverse cast (the game has lots of satirical commentary on American immigration issues), however, it is disappointing that the game's only gay character of note being presented as a mincing, effeminate cliche, although his role as Niko's conscience in several missions is important.The missions are great, ranging from assassinations to massive all-out battles to car chases to helicopter duels amongst the skyscrapers of the city. Towards the end of the game (the single-player missions will take about 25 hours to complete) things start getting a tad repetitive, but generally speaking the missions are varied and fun. Combat has been given a big overhaul, with the addition of cover mechanics. However, enemy AI appears to almost be unchanged from previous games in the series, with them being worse shots than Imperial Stormtroopers, and rarely challenging. Car handling has also been made more realistic, with the cars being heavier and more difficult to stop (aside from the best sports cars). This makes the choice of which car to take on a mission far more important than previously. The game's handling of police pursuits has also been made more realistic, with it being possible to escape the police's attention by getting out of a search zone and lying low. However, it's also much easier than before, and the police are much less of a threat than in previous games.Where the game succeeds is in its depiction of a modern city riven by competing interests (corporate, government and criminal) and its portrayal of Niko as a bewildered individual caught in the middle of it all. The game is a lot of fun, if not quite as insane as the previous instalments of the series, with occasionally effective musings on the nature of violence and its eroding effect on the soul. The game is also heavily satirical, passing commentary on the USA and the issues it faces on many levels (the war on terror, corporate power, the economy, immigration, civil rights) through dialogue and also the game's numerous, entertaining radio stations (and yes, Lazlow returns to Liberty City with a new show).Overall, Grand Theft Auto IV (****) is an impressive, engrossing game. It lacks the tonal variety that the different cities and cultures of San Andreas brought to proceedings, but it has more depth of character and a stronger plot than any previous GTA game. It's also a tragedy, a rather startling choice for Rockstar and a genuine risk for them to take with one of the biggest gaming franchises in the world. Artistically, it pays off handsomely.Technical note: The PC conversion of the game has been criticised in many quarters, particularly for its performance on dual-core machines. Running the game fully patched-up on a brand-new quad-core with 8GB of RAM and a 1GB nVidia 560ti graphics card, I had exactly zero technical issues. Gamers with older PCs may encounter problems, however.",4,"The darkest and most serious entry in the series yet, but still fun",1326585600,"01 15, 2012"

The story has multiple lines for you to explore every possibility and it requires a little bit effort and time to collect all the items, not like 13 (there is basically just a single story line without any side-quests and hidden items).The graphics is the best among current RPGs and the music is great,too. But wait,don't forget the most fundamental element of a 'good' RPG---the story. And the story of FFXIII series? sucks. It's not even half a bit of it's predecessors, 6,7,8,9,10. The stories of previous FFs are just EPIC, even now I can recall the scenes and characters. As for 13-2? Sorry, I even don't know what the story is talking about. They insanely put so many funky terms(like F'ciel? WTF?)  that even don't make any sense, and the build of characters is weak, a teen boy and a teen girl went on a journey to save the world(punch me in the face) because of a ridiculous reason and a dark,evil Mr.who-ever(even cannot remember his name) wanted to destroy the world because of a ridiculous reason. There is nothing in the story can make me sad, angry or joy(A good story has power on the viewer's emotions). The story is so detached from 13, as they introduced a new concept of time-travelling,which almost has nothing to do with the previous story, it looks like a completely new game just with old faces. If SE wants to make XIII a trilogy, well, they simply failed. I can tell whoever writes the story is ambitious, hoping to creat a world with brand new civilization, language and culture, but he is incapable of doing that, the result is disastrous. In terms of this, I think FF12 did a much greater job. And I really don't like Lightning in person because she just looks like a girl Cloud(or should I say all the characters designed by Nobura basically have the same kind of face) and I really can't tell her personality and merits based on the weak story.There is nothing impressive about this ""heroine"".

This even dates back to when I would play the NES game ""GOLF"" which was a favorite at our house - heck, even my dad would play that.There's not that much difference year to year, so if you have the prior year's version I could not justify the $60 for minor upgrades and such. However, if you're new to the PS3 console or new to the sport, this is a good one.As far as positives go, I really like the way the clubs handle as far as the swing itself goes. The analog stick works well. It's very easy to learn and control and hit decent tee shots. Also, surprisingly, I like the new putting system. I'm not very good at it, but it's easy to use, easy to handle. The create-a-player is very good too.As far as the negatives go, in the create-a-player career mode, some of the putting greens are maddeningly challenging. Some of these are nearly impossible on the higher-stakes tournaments. For a casual gamer like myself, it can be frustrating.The ability to play online against someone else - especially someone else's create-a-player - is really fun too. It's a great way to pass the time rather than just playing by yourself, locked away in your basement. So a big plus for that.Overall it's a great game and highly recommended to those new to the PS3 or who don't have a prior Tiger Woods game.

THE PROBLEMS ARE NOT THAT BAD!!!!!!!to start, the framrate sucks in the ps2, it's a little better in the xbox version, but is almost non existent in the gamecube version.the controls are FINE! i see nothing wrong with them. the exception is the homing attack. it can kill you once or twice but that's it. the new speeds just over loads their brain so they can adjust to whats happening, but the common person can adjust.now for the guns, YOU CAN CHOSE TO USE THEM OR NOT!

9017,227830,A3BJRJ6TQIA4MO,B00EM5UFEK,jenkins748,"[8, 15]","It took me a little while to get used to it because it is quite a bit different than the original 2d plants vs zombie games. There are a few different modes of play and I think so far I prefer the 4 player co-op mode called ""Garden Ops"" the best. All of them are a 3rd person shooter style game. They all require Xbox live gold membership because you are always playing with other people online. For the Garden Ops mode you will always play as plants. You will have 3 other plant team members. You can choose from any combination of the following: a pea shooter, cactus, sunflower, and chomper. Each has their own unique abilities. You will fight against 10 waves of zombie attacks and finally try to successfully reach the loading zone where craaaazzy dave will after a certain amount of time fly everyone away to safety for the win. Over time you need to level up your plant in order to become stronger. Leveling up can get pretty hard even at level 4. If you want to get super competitive plan on spending a lot of time doing the different difficult tasks to level up to a high level. There are different difficulty settings you can choose too. You may be stuck on easy or normal difficulty until you level your plants up quite a bit. I'm finding that you can't exclusively level up in the 4 player co-op mode which is irritating. Some of the tasks to level up require you to vanquish or kill of a certain number of players. You cannot achieve this in co-op mode because you're all on a team and it is impossible to vanquish a player. So you must go to the 24 player multiplayer action mode to finish those tasks. It's not so bad though since the games go relatively quickly and can still be a lot of fun. In this mode you play as either plants or zombies. The zombie team has 4 choices as well each with unique abilities. Football player, foot soldier, scientist, and engineer. When you play this mode expect to get your a$$ beat because there are many other players at much higher levels which can make it somewhat difficult to level up during the earlier stages. Still fun trying but can get frustrating at times. I really really do hope that they come out with a one player co-op mode where you can just play against the computer somehow. That way you do not HAVE to have xbox live to play the game. Sometimes I just want to play a computer anyway.  Overall, still loads of fun and I would still recommend it.*UPDATE* 4/1/2014I find I'm still having the urge to play this during my free time.  It is very fun and addicting to play!  I'd like to mention that when you play you earn points.  You get more points the better you do.  As you earn points you can open up stickers in the sticker shop.  There are different packs ranging from 1000 points to 40000 points.  The more you spend the better your cards will be.  After opening you then choose one of the array of cards that is shown.  This is where you get a variety of potted plants to plant around your base for protection, or an array of zombies that automatically attack the plant's garden for you.  There are also character upgrades to give you stronger weapons, armor and abilities.  There's different character skins you can collect as well.  Another notable card that I've recently noticed is a ""skip star challenge"".  These are the ""tasks"" that I was talking about earlier.  These cards make it easier to level up quicker if you're stuck on a star challenge.  If you can get over needing xbox live gold, not having a split screen two player mode, and the server not being perfect (sometimes it gets glitchy and looses your connection or is jittery)you will most likely enjoy this game a lot.

I picked up Warfighter during the Black Friday deals for $30.  I just finished the campaign and I have to say I enjoyed it.  There were a few big complaints that I read over and over while I was researching Warfighter:1-Authenticity2-Lack of emotional connection3-Length4-Campaign hard to follow5-Driving sequencesAuthenticity-Overall I thought the campaign was pretty authentic.  I enjoyed the fact that it wasn't so fast paced as some other shooters out there.  It wasn't all based on 'hollywood' type action(running and gunning).  It did take skill and some strategy to get through some sections.  The ability to peak around corners or over walls was a great.  I really think this made the game feel fluid.  On the flip side, you have unlimited ammo for your secondary piece.  This, and the fact that you can ask for ammo at any point from your comrade's does detract from the realism.  This didn't really bother me too much though.  I've never been a big fan of scavenging for guns.  The campaign is designed well enough that you depend on your primary weapon enough that you don't spend all your time using your secondary.Lack of emotional connection- Contrary to what I read in reviews I thought there was plenty of emotional connection.  You play as two different characters, Stump and Preacher.  There is no emotional tie to Stump, but you do get involved in Preacher's story (and Mother's).  Without getting too detailed, I'll just say I was: disturbed, angry and worried over Preacher and Mother's predicaments.Length- I wouldn't have minded a longer campaign, but it wasn't so short that I felt robbed.Campaign Hard to Follow- It was hard to follow at times, but the fact that it wasn't a completely linear story isn't a bad thing.  The point behind the Medal of Honor series is authenticity.  As I see it, Danger Close is giving us (the player) insight into the life of a Tier 1 soldier.  Some of the missions nearer the beginning appear to be just that.  Almost random in that they don't really connect with the rest of the story, but they do show how chaotic the life of these guys can/could be.Driving Sequence- The driving sequences were almost refreshing.  It was nice to do something a little different.  I didn't have a problem with their length as I've heard some people mention.Multiplayer - I've only played a few rounds of multiplayer, but I'm loving it so far.To sum it up, the game has flaws, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Reckoning features the stylings of former Marvel Comics artist (and baseball fan) Todd McFarlane.

Now a world where the future is inevitable suddenly becomes uncertain.If the idea of battling monsters for gobs of loot in a high fantasy setting sounds appealing, you'll enjoy this first release from Schilling & Co.  Be aware, however, there are a few rookie mistakes.  The most serious issue, at least for PC gamers, is this game may make you physically ill.  Prior to release, a demo showcased the first few levels of the game.  Immediately the forums lit up with complaints about PC gamers being unable to play for more than a few minutes before experiencing motion sickness.  This stems from a concept known as field of view.  In short, when you are viewing a television across the room, you are seeing roughly a 60-degree angle of vision.  Games developed for video game consoles are programmed with this in mind.  Unfortunately, this causes a problem when you attempt to play the same game on a PC monitor.  Your field of view is wider, usually 90-100 degrees, because your eyes are much closer to a monitor screen.  Unfortunately, this was not factored into the game's release.  For PC gamers it's rather like trying to play the game with your face pressed up against a television and you find yourself trying to, but being unable to, scroll the camera back.  Supposedly a patch is in the works, but seeing multiple DLC released before a single patch is not encouraging.Another common complaint is the game is too easy, even on its hardest setting.  It's partially a reflection of the trend toward extremely challenging games as evidenced by popular favorites like Dark Souls and Super Meat Boy.  In Reckoning's case, you can become very difficult to defeat without trying to exploit the game deliberately.  Weapons and armor become too powerful, too fast, and you will have more gold than you'll be able to spend in later levels.  Aside from the occasional boss monster you may find the game provides little challenge.The art and the environment of Amalur is rather interesting.  Large waterfalls and green forests in one area, sandy red rock deserts in another.  Huge sprawling castles and constricted dungeons with magical doorways.  It's all high-fantasy and somewhat familiar, but still nice to look at.  The soundtrack is cinematic and catchy but somewhat infrequent. The people you meet will ask for your help and spout a line or two on various subjects upon request.  You're never really having a conversation, though.  For all the voice acting, and there is an impressive amount in the game, it's rather like reading the Reckoning Wiki.Thanks to Reckoning, combat in starts to come of age in RPG's (and it's about time, frankly).  Wolves surround you and take turns attacking you from the sides while huge Jottun's throw their huge bellies around to resist damage and knock you off balance.  Enchanters fling spells at you from a distance and other monsters come at you with lightning, giant clubs, or poison tipped barbs.  As you kill baddies you alter and collect their fates.  With enough fate you are able to slip into ""reckoning mode"" as high-powered warrior with extra attack power and the ability to perform crunchy and satisfying slow motion kills while you rain death down upon your opponents.  Combat is Reckoning's biggest strength, and it's what sets the game apart from other RPG's.  It would have been even more effective if you felt much danger of dying.  Because of the relative ease of the game you may find yourself simply mashing buttons to move to the next character instead of learning each monster's attack patterns and weaknesses.  It's easy to fall into some bad habits simply for the sake of moving the game forward.After a while, the game's grand scale and many quests start to highlight the relative lack of variety.  There is no shortage of things to do and starting out I tried to complete every side quest I could find while exploring the areas for lorestones; collectable items designed to enhance the story and reward explorers with statistical bonuses.  I scavenged the areas for alchemy reagents and did battle with any enemy unfortunate enough to pick a fight with an experience-hungry warrior/rogue.  It was fun.  After a while, though, the quests started feeling mighty familiar and the towns started looking mighty familiar and the enemies... well, you know.  A month later and 80 hours into the game, things aren't much different than the first few hours.  Suddenly it dawns on me that, for all of the quests I've completed and the people I've saved (or killed), my actions have made no impact on the Kingdom of Amalur.  If, however, you're the type of person who enjoys the grind for the sake of grinding, whether it's finding a rare weapon, finishing the various faction quests, completing all of the game's achievements, or just a set of armor, then Reckoning may be the game for you.",3,Curt Schilling's first game is a large but sprawling experience,1331251200,"03 9, 2012"

So I jumped on it when I later found out it had been released, and got a good deal on the collector's edition.As the title says, I really wanted to like this game. I'm a fan of the Resident Evil & Silent Hill series, as well as other titles on the genre spectrum like Siren and Fatal Frame. Add to that the location setting of Tibetan mountains and Far East mythology, and it sounded like an awesome entry into my library. Alas, I was to be disappointed.Some people have stated the game was slow, but I agree with others that say that for survival horror, it's pretty standard, so I didn't have a problem with that. I was even enjoying the story and main character, for as far as I got. What killed my enjoyment was the controls and laggy response in the combat system. Encounters with one or two monsters was manageable, but the controls were clunky enough that more enemies than that made it extremely difficult to keep going and eventually I got frustrated and stopped playing it.The game mechanic of 'slashing' the enemies with the Wii-mote was intriguing, but the way the programmers implemented it, was far too twitchy to keep the game fun. I would vastly have preferred something like the glyph system in Castlevania: Dawn Of Sorrow. For those not familiar with it, different monsters were defeated by a particular glyph you drew with your stylus. Something like that would have been fairly easy with a Wii-mote. Instead the game had trouble registering basic movements with it, probably due to poor programming.It really was a shame, because I was looking forward to this game. Perhaps some day I'll go back and try again, but I have a lot of other things to play first so it doesn't look very likely. I'm sure plenty of 'hard core' gamers out there will think I'm just a wuss with poor skills, but I literally own about 800 games across a dozen consoles and the PC. I'm not a top-tier 'twitch' gamer, but I think my skills are pretty good most of the time. I've also noticed that it seems like some consumers are retaliating against lower-star reviews, despite those reviews being pretty well written, almost like they're down-rating because the person didn't like the game. In my experience (six years selling them at retail), EVERY game is going to have someone that didn't like it for one reason or another. I don't mind people defending why they liked a game, but don't take it out on people who didn't agree with you.",3,I wanted to like this more than I did.,1309564800,"07 2, 2011"

I think years of console experience has ingrained into our heads that we MUST have a memory card. In the past that has been more than true (try having a Dreamcast without several). Years of PC experience has always made me laugh at console gamers for reasons such as this, but that didn't stop me from buying a memory card when I picked up my Xbox on Nov 16th.The only thing keeping me from saying, &quot;and boy what a mistake that was&quot; is the fact that some day I might actually have a use for the thing. Someday I might need to have my information portable. Of course I did also buy the custom Xbox backpack so I can easily transport my Xbox anywhere, so why do I really need this?The Xbox has over six gigabytes of hard drive space. It translates that info into memory blocks. When you view your Xbox HD memory it only says 50,000+ blocks. Now I own five Xbox titles (Halo, DOA3, Project Gotham, Fuzion Frenzy, and Amped) and all of their saved games are saved to the hard drive. I also have three full music CDs copied to the disk and the box still says I have 50,000+ memory available. Don't worry about running out of room on your hard drive. Six gigabytes is an enormous amount or space.While I'm sure this is a solid product as far as quality goes, it is insanely over priced. Now if Microsoft would have gone the Sega route and made VMUs I could see paying 30-40 bucks for them, because at least then they would have some use.If you still really want to own a memory card, by an aftermarket one as they are almost half the cost, and you really aren't going to use it much.

Possibly in part just because the series has gotten stale (if you have played a previous game, this one is exactly the same but not as good). Maybe I was able to over-look problems with the game earlier that I can't anymore.I read a review and they loved the game and said the controls were great. They played a different game than I did. In my game, there are many (many) instances of the controls just-not-quite doing what you want. I mean, you see what happens on the screen, you swear, you look at your controller to see if you WERE pressing the buttons/sticks you thought and... you were. The game just wasn't doing what it should. An example: &lt;SPOILER> The game ends with a boss fight. After awhile you are fighting two enemies at the same time. The game gives you spears to throw. I pick up the spears, and press FORWARD at the enemy I want to hit but the spears won't shoot at him. The game does this many times. I got mad and quit fighting the final boss (and eventually quit the game without ever beating him because I hate the controls and camera). The controls are often stupidly frustrating for no reason, like if you roll out of the way of something, after your roll your character just stands still for awhile. He just stands there. So, if you rolled out of the way of one attack, and are being attacked again (happens a lot of course) you can do NOTHING BUT STAND THERE for awhile. The game is pretty easy (on normal, what I was playing) so you can overlook this... mostly... but that doesn't mean you don't hate it every single time it happens (so you are hating the game every minute or two because of bad controls).The camera. Lots of times the developers incorrectly thought the game would be made better if they zoom out really far so you can't see what is happening. That is stupid and frustrating. However, the rest of the time the camera is mostly OK. Mostly. Lots of times it is hard to see what is going on because it zooms in too close, or too far, or is angled slightly wrong. Like the controls, the camera isn't HORRIBLE (except when it zooms way out for no reason) but it is something that makes me ANGRY at the game and not want to play it.I think every game should have perfect controls and perfect camera. If you can't do that, you shouldn't make games. I am sure it is very hard and takes work to do, but do it. I can usually forgive a lesser game having controls/camera as bad as this one does (they aren't super-horrible) but this is a ""triple A"" game. They should figure this stuff out. If the question is: ""it looks slightly better like this or it controls and is fantastically more fun like this"", the game developers should choose the more fun, better controlling option EVERY TIME.",2,"Bad controls, bad camera",1377129600,"08 22, 2013"

1151,123121,A8RGWWCC1PVMQ,B001UU1WN8,NeoTristan,"[8, 15]","My relationship with Madden series has been very rocky.While I've always loved Madden series for the gameplay mechanics when it comes to play selection and execution on the field, everything else about the game such as animation, facial model, commentary and game presentation has never been Madden's strong suit.I had a big hope for the last year's game. While not really the game I had hope it would be, it was the closest thing to the level of Sega's ESPN 2K5. This year, the hype machine from EA boldly claimed that Madden 10 will definitely erase the memory of Sega's now defunct football game with much more NFL broadcast feel and overall presentation.Madden 10 is most definitely the step backward from the last year. Sure it is the best looking madden game ever. It's got various new online modes. But on par with ESPN 2K5's presentation, it is not even close. EA added a few scenes showing spectators cheering, concession box activities, cheerleading squad dancing, which were done by Sega back in the Dreamcast era. What's missing is decent in-game recap with commentary, stats presentation and comparison, pregame show, half-time report, postgame show, news recap with substance all in the sports news style. Awful, incorrect and lackluster play-by-play commentary and sparse recap and insightful colorful commentary in each game's context is worse than even Madden of the past. Have you heard the commentary in ESPN 2K series, EA? Furthermore, all the extra features entirely focuses on online-features rather than to give you real depth on pseudo-experience on NFL life. Bucketful of extra features such as crib, coach's mode, franchise mode, business mode, 1st person football, trophies were all done better almost decade ago by 2K series.The gameplay mechanics and execution is as good as ever but not a single noticeable major upgrade like 'playmaker' or 'QB vision' from the last year except gang tackles. If anything, the flow of the game is now tad slower than the last year.Just when Sega's ESPN 2K series was about to surpass Madden in terms of popularity, EA purchased the NFL exclusivity and killed off any possible competition. And the result has been dissimal except Madden 09. Madden 06 was horrible, 07 was mediocre, 08 was slightly better, 09 was actually almost great, and now 10 is very disappointing considering all the potentials it had and the hype they created.The series is exactly where EA wants it to be; game sells every year no matter what with no other competition, tons of online features that might requires additional fees. The thing that bothers me the most is that EA spends tons of money every year on Madden but not on the actual innovation. EA throws money on advertisement, NFL exclusive fee, more advertisement, online features, more advertisement, fees on new facial model for new stars, more advertisement and pay little focus on what would actually make the game great. But I am not surprised. After all, it's EA. ""EA SPORTS, IT'S NOT IN THE GAME."" It had been in Sega's NFL 2K series. Madden 09 remains the best Madden in the series, but it took the 20th anniversary collector's edition, which includes Head Coach 09, to match all the features that was already included in ESPN 2K5. And the game was mere $20 when it was released.  Once again, ESPN 2K5 will be sorely missed this year, or until Madden actually eradicates all mistakes and come out with the definitive version.***Addendum***The people who think 2K series were superior to Madden believe so because the series captured the exact feel of the broadcasting-style NFL experience. 2K was more arcady while Madden was geared toward football simulation.I am a huge fan of NFL, to me, the only American sports still worth watching. I used to buy 2K and Madden together annually to enhance my NFL experience because neither one was perfect. I ended up enjoying 2K more overall in 2K4 and 2K5 past Madden. What pro-Madden at all cost people do not plainly see is the same software companies like EA (Spore), Activision (Modern Warfare 2) DO take their customers for granted and spend tons of money not on talent but on advertisement and business deal to ensure more people are addicted to their products (not for the right reasons) so their products will always be sold no matter what without any question asked. If you are familiar with the history of video game industry, you know how many (hundreds) talented and creative game developers were absorbed by EA, Activision and Ubisoft without rewarding the actual talents.I am not mad because EA bought NFL exclusivity or Madden sells better than majority of video games every year. In fact, I cross my finger every year that EA comes out with the definitive edition of Madden. But we're talking about EA here, the same company who thought all customers are nothing but stupid consumers who will pay for anything EA provides and to a certain extent, EA's wish has come true. If it weren't for now notoriously infamous 'Spore' backlash with the DRM to end all DRM, EA would have put even worse DRM on 'The Sims 3' and definitely would have on upcoming 'Dragon Age: Origins'. Sensible gamers made a stand enough is enough and drew the line with lawsuits, boycott and torrent downloads. EA, being efficient profit-driven company, weighted all pros and cons and decided to back down.I'll never be loyal to any company and product blindly. I'll drop my favorite games such as 'The Elder Scrolls', 'Metal Gear', 'Zelda' or 'Metroid' any time they become stale. No company or product deserves any loyalty blindly and persistently. A product should always speak for itself by the quality and worth. Is 'Madden 10' a bad product? I don't think so, hence I rewarded 3 out of 5. Is it great product that meets its potential? Not by a long shot. Is it worthy to get Madden every year if things remain unchanged?

I got it knowing that it wasn't strictly an RPG game anymore but more of a platformer-RPG.  I wasn't happy with the change but was more than willing to give it a chance.  Ultimately, I found a game that was fun but holds itself back through some poor design choices.Story - Count Bleck has decided that he wants to end all worlds by using the power of the chaos heart.  He obtains this by forcing Bowser and Peach to get married.  Mario and company get separated and he meets Tippi who teleports him to Flipside where he meets Merlon.  Merlon explains that Mario needs to collect the 8 pure hearts to stop Count Bleck.  You'll go through 8 different worlds to obtain them.  The whole pure hearts story isn't exactly compelling, especially the way in which you obtain some of them.  That said, the rest of the story is pretty good.  There's plenty of funny dialogue and humorous things happening throughout to keep you entertained.Gameplay - The game mostly plays like a platformer.  You'll run around and hop on enemies heads in real time.  You'll find plenty of blocks to hit and get coins and other goodies.  The RPG elements of the game are much lighter than the previous games and some seemed tacked on.  You can use attack items or healing items at any time and can hold up to 10 of them.  There will be plenty of dialogue and plenty of puzzles to solve.  You'll get experience for killing any enemies or for picking up some objects.  Every so many points you'll level up which gives you all your life back and then you'll get 5 extra hit points 1 level and 1 extra attack power the next.  This will rotate throughout the game.  You will get 8 Pixls throughout the game which give you certain powers depending on which one you have equipped.  One lets you pick up objects and throw them, another lets you put a bomb down to hurt enemies or blow up blocks and another lets you shrink yourself down.  There are some side quests and other things to do but for the most part, I didn't bother with them because they were generally fetch quests or time consuming things.The big thing about the gameplay is the ability for Mario to switch between 2D and 3D at any time.  This works out reasonably well and allows for a lot of things that wouldn't normally be possible in a strictly 2D game.  Most puzzles are solved in the game by switching back and forth between the two.  One minor gripe I have about this is that the view they give you here can make it somewhat tedious to kill enemies.  You'll often jump just over an enemy and land right in front/behind them and get hurt by them.The biggest 2 gripes I have about the ability to flip really drag the game down.  First, you have a time limit you can be in 3d.  Once it hits 0, Mario takes 1 damage and it fills back up.  If you flip back to 2d before the timer runs out it fills back up at an absurdly slow pace. I'm not sure exactly why they did this.  It makes searching for things in 3d annoying and time consuming.  There are some parts where you'll want to be in 3d for a minute or 2 to collect some coins, hit some blocks or explore the area and you'll find that you're much more willing to just take 1 damage then wait the 20-30 seconds for the timer to fill back up.  The second major gripe I have here is that Mario is the only character that you can go into 3d with.  If you select any other character while in 3d you'll instantly be flipped back to 2d.  You will need to go into 3d constantly throughout the game to solve puzzles, find secrets and transverse areas.  So unless you want to constantly change your character by going into the start menu, you'll find that you're pretty much stuck playing as Mario throughout the whole game.Characters - There are 4 playable characters in the game, each with their own unique powers, Mario, Luigi, Peach and Bowser.  As I just mentioned, you'll find yourself playing as Mario for the majority of the game simply because you can't be bothered with having to change characters every 20 seconds.  This makes me surly as someone who would've liked to spend more time playing as Luigi.  Merlon and all of the characters in Flip-Side are totally forgettable and uninteresting, though Tippi is alright.  The most memorable and interesting characters other than our heroes tend to be Count Bleck's minions.Controls - I really have no complaints here.  The controls are solid.  There is nothing here not to like.Difficulty - This is another area where the game lets me down.  This game is incredibly easy.  At no point was I in any real danger of dying.  Almost every enemy is just a minor object in your path because they're so simple to kill.  Bosses are rarely difficult at all, some you'll kill within 20 seconds whereas others just take a little more time to kill because they have invulnerable periods.  Your partner Tippi will tell you how to beat every single one of them so there is no guesswork or need to figure out how to beat a boss.  Just going through the game and with no backtracking, I had 55 hp at the end of the game.  Even the end game boss was a complete cake walk.  Was the 2 whole damage Count Bleck was doing to me supposed to scare me?  I had 4 or 5 items that gave me 50hp back at any time, none of which I'd bought and I didn't even use any during the final fights.  The puzzles in this game are incredibly simple most of the time, though they do get better towards the end and there was one or two that took me a minute or two to figure out.Length -  I ended up somewhere around 19 hours.  I'd say expect anywhere from 17 hours - 21 hours.  Longer if you're doing the side quests and such.  I guess there is some sort of after game stuff you can do but I didn't bother with it.Thoughts pro -  There are some fun and interesting levels.  Having to work off my debt in world 2 was a unique experience.  There's an item that spawns a bunch of miniature NES versions of Mario or Luigi that surround you and follow you.  They'll hop on enemies and hurt them for you or if they walk into an enemy they'll hurt the enemy and die off.  Always enjoyed finding those little fellows, especially for the old school jumping sound effect that plays each time they jump.Thoughts con - There are some absolutely tedious levels in this game.  6-1 immediately springs to mind.  In this level you run into one enemy on a stage, talk to him, fight him, then go through a door.  Repeat this 23 times.  It's the same exact background and everything each time.  I just starting skipping the dialogue for each enemy you fight as it just became annoying.  It's just a terrible level to play through.  World 7 is also slightly annoying as well.In order to access the next world, you have to go back to Flipside and place a heart into a heart pillar.  I understand the reasons for doing this but it occasionally got annoying.  The heart pillars are all in the same area generally, you just have to know which route to take and which one you can actually get to.  Doing this gets somewhat more tedious once you access the other town known as Flopside, which is mostly a mirror of Flipside.Not a lot of interesting things to do with your money or for doing sidequests.  Some of the pixls are absolutely worthless.  You need the cudgel one for one section of the game and then never touch it again and there's one that you use to cross some spikes a whole whopping 2 times.Final thoughts - I enjoyed the game and found it fun.  The dialogue for the most part is entertaining and everything generally works well together.  The actual gameplay is mostly satisfying.  That said, I also found it annoying and tedious at times.  The game is a complete cakewalk to get through which I don't like.  I want a challenge, I want to die a couple times along the way and have to get better.  I enjoyed the game while I was playing it but I could only take so much at a time.  I never had the craving to play it like the other ones and it took some willpower to actually turn it on to play.  It's a fine game in spite of itself but I hope this isn't the direction the series keeps going.  Overall I'd give it a 7/10.",3,A fun game that holds itself down.,1356048000,"12 21, 2012"

It has a very steep learning curve, due to the detail of customization for creating your mech (or Next as they are called in this game). But outside of that, this is a really fun game. It has 42 campaign missions and 30 1 on 1 Next battles. The online play is not to be taken lightly, as this is where many people who are very familiar with the game get most of their fun. So online is very competitive. Many of the campaign missions feature huge mobile enemy bases called Arms Forts which you have to battle in a medley of interesting ways, which all lead to some very fun, fast-paced, action packed battles.

This has to be one of the most beautifully animated games ive ever seen, in the beginning of the game you are in an elf kingdom wandering about, and the detail everthing down to the blades of grass is astonishing. I played the first hour of the game just wandering arounding looking at this highly detailed enviroment, this must have cost some serious artist hours. But enough about looks, kameo herself only has 2 moves one is sprawling out her wings and hovering around which is the fastest way to travel and the other is a backflip kick which is her only attack, but the fun starts when you get the characters that you can morph into, each has their own abilties and you can upgrade them with fruits that you can get in several different ways, ranging from helping some poor tree man get rid of the pests in his house, to winning them in side games that show your skill with the warrior trainer, also when you start getting more characters you can chain the morphing and the moves together for really cool effects, in some places you have to, bottom line a beautfully rendered game, with a decnt story and fun gameplay, not a bad deal at the lowered price.",4,Nice change of pace,1153785600,"07 25, 2006"

My favorite games are third person shooters and I give most of them a try and most turn out to be ok.  I'm Glad I purchase this game at a low price because this game is not worth more than $20.  The only thing I find good in this game is the graphics, Creativity and some of the Boss Battles.You can give this game a try if you have beaten every game and have nothing else to play or you love third person shooters and play them for what they are.I think the Biggest mistake they made with this game is that the enemy doesn't speak English.  no communication no excitement.  If they are human they should communicate in a language we understand. Otherwise make them creatures, aliens or something else.The Developers try to put you in the characters shoe, you are just as lost as the character is, you do not know what the blue is going on and not much is explained. this is not necessary a bad thing.Some people complain that no hints are giving when fighting Bosses.  this is also not a bad thing.  I actually don't mind because games years ago use to be like this all the time.  you had to figure out how the enemies weakness to be able to defeat them.Here are the cons1. The game looks different but doesn't have that original feel2. The game needs more checkpoints,  you die you start far back.3. Headshots do not seem to matter in this game.  It is treated like a body part.  you have to shoot the head multiple times to kill them except for the sniper.4  Shooting doesn't feel interesting.  as your shooting the enemy it seems like your missing or your bullets are not hitting the enemy.",3,Could Be Better,1344729600,"08 12, 2012"

I play a racing game once in a great while, but have been doing one here and there for almost 15 years now.
